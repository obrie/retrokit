# Roadmap

There are too many improvements to count here, but some ideas are:

* Move manualkit to sdl2
* Support Raspberry Pi Buster (when officially supported by RetroPie)
* Support for more systems (Amiga, Apple II, etc.)
* Support for non-Raspbian platforms
* Support different frontends (attractmode, pegasus)
* More comprehensive compatibility ratings

If you want to make changes for your own specific setup, feel free to.  I'll accept
contributions for anything that will make it easier for you to customize this to your
own setup.

Also, if you have improvements that will help everyone, I'll happily review those.

## Context

My focus has been and always will be to improve retrokit based on the systems I'm
personally building.  This means the places where you're most likely to see major changes
in are likely:

* Support for Raspberry Pi Buster
* Support for more systems (Amiga, Apple II, etc.)

The other ideas in this roadmap are simply ideas for a rainy day.  Of course, I'd love
to see retrokit support continue to expand.  To that extent, if you have the passion
to build new support into retrokit, please reach out and connect with me!
