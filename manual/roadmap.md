## Future improvements

There are too many improvements to count here, but some ideas are:

* Move manualkit to sdl2
* Support for more systems (Amiga, Apple II, etc.)
* Support for non-Raspbian platforms
* Support different frontends (attractmode, pegasus)
* More comprehensive compatibility ratings
* Support axis controls in manualkit

If you want to make changes for your own specific setup, feel free to.  I'll accept
contributions for anything that will make it easier for you to customize this to your
own setup.

Also, if you have improvements that will help everyone (e.g. perhaps there are better
ways of doing autconfig for controllers), I'll happily review those.
