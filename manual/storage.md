## Storage Capacity

The `filter-1tb` profile assumes that there is 1TB of capacity available for installing
ROMs.  These filters generally have the following rules:

* 1G1R (one game per region)
* Excluded categories: Adult, Board games, Casino, Educational
* For CD-based systems, 1G1F (one game per franchise, e.g. sports franchies)

The approximate capacity required per system is broken down below:

or so (so a 2TB drive).
