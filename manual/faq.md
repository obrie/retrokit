## Wouldn't it be easier to just distribute an image?

Yes.  And not legal.  The purpose of this project is not to illegally distribute ROMs.
It is intended to provide a platform that makes it easier for you to legally manage
your RetroPie system.

In the future, it could be possible to create an image that just contains the
configurations / screenshots / etc. without any game data.
