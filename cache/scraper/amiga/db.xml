    <resource id="f73743235e4ddc1b19077b740bade3be9b8c8a18" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">The game is based on an 1870 novel by Jules Verne.

On July 5th, 1867 the government decided to launch the famous ship the &amp;quot;Abraham Lincoln&amp;quot;, which will leave on the trail of a sea monster. The great French professor Mr. Arronax will also take part in the expedition. The weeks passed without any sign of the monster's presence in the area, when, one day, 300 miles from the shores of Queen Charlotte's Island... three members of the expedition set out on board the Nautilus, a submarine navigated by Captain Nemo. The player takes Anorax's role to find out more.

Most of the game is spent on the Nautilus, which consists of three rooms: the living room, the control room and the library. There the player can manipulate objects and talk to people to receive hints what to do next and the state of the Nautilus. With the map, he influences the route. Sometimes the player leaves the submarine to explore other locations, and respectively solves puzzles to receive more hints or to solve action sequences, e.g., fighting against a shark. 

The game is played in real-time, which means the key to success is being in the right location at the right time. This also results in various possibilities to render the game unwinnable, and causes waiting times. For the same reason, the player also needs to watch Nemo's mood. If he angers Nemo, e.g., by manipulating the ship instruments, he locks the player into his room and valuable time passes. The game is played completely in point &amp; click and has no function to save progress.</resource>

These items have to be collected in the maze which consists of 150 isometric rooms. These can be explored freely but sometimes you need to have special objects to proceed, e.g. a candle in dark rooms. The dangers consist mostly of sharp objects which can cause your ball to burst. Additionally you are on a timer because your balloon loses air constantly.

In the first few levels you have to guide the main character Kaneda through an obstruction filled road on his motorcycle. Obstacles come in the form of roadblocks, holes in the road, which must be jumped with the use of a ramp, and a variety of characters on the road who throw bombs at you. The roadblocks can only be cleared by grenades which you pick up by knocking over traffic cones. You must also make it to the end of the level without running out of fuel.

After the motorcycle levels there are five platform levels. The object of these levels is basically to kill everyone you come in contact with, each kill adding to a meter which you have to fill to complete the level.</resource>

The game requires a lightgun which is used to shoot the numerous enemies appearing on the screen. There are a few enemy types which need more or less hits to be defeated; some of them unleash powerful attacks when they are not disposed of within a certain time frame. Of course the other enemies are also able to damage the player's life energy and running out causes death. Along with ammo, it can be refilled by shooting packages which drop in after a certain amount of points are earned. The background (first desert, then jungle) automatically scrolls from left to right and than back; the goal is to survive this ordeal often enough.</resource>

The game tells a story of Lester, a young scientist who, as a result of an experiment gone wrong, finds himself in a dangerous alien world where he is forced to fight for his survival.

Originally developed for the Amiga and Atari ST and later released for the Apple IIGS and DOS platforms, the game was widely ported to other contemporary systems. Later efforts resulted in several game engine recreations for the game that permitted it to run on modern computers, consoles and mobile phones. In 2006, Chahi independently released a 15th Anniversary Edition for Windows which allowed the game to be played on modern computers with original or enhanced visuals; following up in 2011 for its 20th anniversary, ports of the game were prepared for iOS and Android based devices.

Another World was highly innovative in its use of cinematic effects in both real-time and cutscenes, which granted the game praise amongst critics and commercial success. It also influenced a number of other video games and designers.

Another World is a platform game, featuring a control scheme wherin the player uses either the keyboard, joystick or gamepad to make the protagonist run, jump, attack and perform other, situation specific actions such as rocking a cage back and forth. In the initial part of the game, Lester is unarmed, as he is able to kick at small creatures but is otherwise defenseless.

Later in the game, the player acquires a laser pistol from a fallen foe. The pistol has three capabilities: a standard fire mode, the ability to create force fields to block enemy fire, and a powerful charged shot that can break through force fields and some walls.[3] Eventually, Lester also gains a plasma ball that can be used like a grenade to defeat foes (not featured in the original Amiga release). Enemies also have the same capabilities, requiring the player to take advantage of the three gun modes and the environment to overcome them.

Lester and his alien ally cannot sustain any damage, and the game ends immediately if either of them is struck by a projectile or comes in contact with an animal or an environmental hazard.[4] However, the game uses numerous checkpoints enabling the player to keep restarting at the last point indefinitely. On the Amiga and older consoles without the ability to save a game, the player can write down an alphanumeric code for these checkpoints and re-enter it when restarting the game later. The game provides no clues as to what to do next, features no HUD (with an exception of oxygen bar during the swimming sequences) and no on-screen text, and the characters the player meets speak in unintelligible alien</resource>

It can be played either against the computer, with a choice of up to 10 levels of difficulty, or against another human player. Other options allow you to play a match or start a training session, as well as select between &amp;quot;plain&amp;quot; (empty board) and &amp;quot;prepared&amp;quot; (pre-arranged balls on the board) game modes. A demo mode is also available, where the computer plays against itself.

An angel and a devil compete against each other, with the goal of aligning five &amp;quot;balls&amp;quot; in a row on the board, either horizontally, vertically or diagonally. They are moved around the board with the joystick, pushing each other as their paths cross, and strategically placing balls on the edge of the board to both disrupt their opponent's lines and try to create a line of 5 of their own balls.

Each level features different background and board graphics. There is no background music playing during the game, and only basic sound effects when the two characters push each other, place a ball on the board and win.</resource>

Up to four players can compete in the events, but not playing at the same time, but in a hot-seat mode. Control is like in other sports games: you have to gain speed pushing the joystick in a perfect rhythm, and pushing the trigger at the right time, i.e. to start jumping in the Long Jump and High Jump discipline.
Unlike other games of the genre, humor is not getting short, as a referee is constantly pestering at you, making sarcastic comments if you fail to reach very good results. Most events are visually presented on several screens which are flipped (not scrolled).</resource>

There are a variety of weapons (including your standard boomerang!) and powerups to help you along your way through the five different levels.

There are three skill levels to Assassin, Rookie, Arcade and Ultimate. As well as changing the difficulty, each level unlocks more of the game than the level that is easier than it. The enemies are tougher to defeat in the higher levels, but there are more rewards.

The player has to guide the protagonist named Androids van Laptop on his journey to rescue his lost maiden.

The game itself flips screens, no scrolling is involved. In melee combat you can hit with your sword (if you have one), or throw stones if you want to stay at distance. Weapons can be purchased at shops, which are placed frequently on the platforms. During your way, you collect money and gems to stock up for better weapons. You can jump, take objects (especially keys), use objects, and often ladders have to be climbed. The game character has two attributes: hit points, representing the health, and strength, which defines how much damage the player's character is doing to enemies and is defined by the equipment and weapon the character is carrying.

There are eight levels. Beside the platform game, there is a futuristic gag: directly after loading the game you can decide not to enter the game, but the &amp;quot;system&amp;quot;. The system is a text-based Unix-like console, in which by typing commands a Space Invaders game and some pictures of the developers can be found.</resource>

A computerized opponent, fairly obviously, as well as the chance to play without using up the earth’s limited paper and pen resources.  The possibility of cheating is removed as well.

Elite go beyond this by changing the shapes of the ships to be more Tetris style, and allowing these to be placed at each of the 4 main angles. A ‘Salvo Fire’ mode sees each player fire a succession of shots (each of your six ships gets four shots a turn until it’s sunk), meaning that strategic play involves firing on a wide range initially in the hope of finding a ship, before homing in on the area in the next turn. Finally, there’s an animated sequence for each go, which is depicted as an air strike. As well as standard two-player games, there’s also a multi-player mode in which the winner’s score accumulates until he loses, allowing for a “winner stays on” structure if there are 3 or more of you.

The game takes place above the surface of a ruined, devastated planet: each level starts within a large area, in which your ship has free movement. Avoiding surface hazards, such as auto-aiming turrets, the goal is to destroy enemy spacecraft that hover around the large area in groups. Each wave of attacks is followed by a bomb-dropping mothership, which you must hurry up and destroy before it moves off the playfield, in order to proceed to the next wave; the last mothership gives way to the boss - a gigantic spacecraft that will chase you around the playfield. Beaten it? you are transported to a short section of standard shooter fare, where the screen auto-scrolls vertically, at the end of which you face a final monstrosity. This ends the level - on to the next one.

Absorbing enemy fire will deplete your power, while collecting power-ups and destroying turrets can bring it back up somewhat. At 0% power, the game is over - although you may get an option to continue, based on how far you got.

At the end of each area, there is a boss. In some areas, about half-way through, you may have a mini-boss.

The players take on the role of Johnny Justice or Sammy Stately (Paul Patriot only featured in arcade version) and must shoot their way out of the city. The arcade version had 3 mounted guns, allowing for three player simultaneous action. The home conversions support a maximum of two players.

The player must shoot everything that moves, while conserving ammo and grenades. Your machine gun can kill everything if you hit it enough times, and you can use the grenade launcher for really deadly targets or just to clear the screen of zombie scum. Grenades you can pick up along the way include standard grenades, electro grenade and napalm bombs. Onscreen zombies explode in a splatter of blood and gore.

The screen scrolls in a variety of directions, sometimes in pseudo 3D. You'll be pummelled by a LOT of enemies. Some will be shooting, throwing Molotov cocktails and knifes and other will simply jump right at you. You can shoot knifes out of the air if you aim well enough.

The bosses include a zombie punk who mutates into a dog, a freaky blob-snake-head that comes at the screen and a jeep which comes to life.</resource>

The Lord of Darkness managed to trick the three guardians of the world (a unicorn, a hawk and a beam of light) into imprisonment and now overruns everything with his orc hordes. The player takes the role of a young man, who is called the Beastlord because he can interact with animals, and has to explore three levels with the goal to free the guardians. The levels are side-scrolling in nature, but there are many branches to map out.

The interaction with enemies offers no surprises: the player can perform a variety of combat moves in order to beat them up. Disposed enemies leave items behind, mostly food and money. However, the game requires the player to solve various puzzles in order to progress and to talk to the animals and humans found in the levels. Usually certain items need be found and used at the correct spot respectively traded for another item. Those non-fighting actions are initiated through a pop-up menu. The game also features basic magic, a day/night cycle (some actions are only possible at a certain time) and hunger which causes the need for constant fighting in order to keep the steadily decreasing energy bar up.</resource>

Unfortunately, the previous number one group, The Rappin' Rabbit Rockers, are very angry at the Beavers success. They put a plan into action. Jethro's wife was kidnapped and is being held hostage. She will not be released until the Beavers are disbanded and all their master tapes are destroyed. Jethro is determined not to let his Beaver comrades down. He sets off to rescue his kidnapped wife with the help of his children.

You take the role of Jethro. The aim of the game is to make your way through each level of the game, overcoming the various Rabbits allies you will encounter. For every six levels of the game that you complete, you will be given a code so that he can continue his struggle at a later date. However, the Rabbits don't take too kindly to this, so they send their biggest and most dangerous followers to attack you just prior to him being given the code. To defeat these large beasts, use your spin attack to propel the missiles back at them. Watch out, as rocks are too heavy to bat with your tail and you will use an energy point in trying.

If fighting is not enough, you must collect Charisma Stars to maintain your charisma that you will need to complete a level. 
There are also Life Stars which have the ability to give you another life, but to get these, you must sneak up on them or the will move out of your reach. To keep your helpful children from losing interest, you must find Raccoon Skin Hats to give as gifts to stay in their favor. There are switches serving different functions that need to be activated. Doors will have to be entered to locate secret rooms that may contain the stars or other valuable objects. There are Rubber Leaves that may be needed to access those hard to reach areas. Just try jumping on them. Sometimes to reach the top of a level, clouds may have to be used. Some are more solid than the others. Mushroom Seeds can be used to grow your own platform to access other platforms. You may come across machinery that activate lifts or send a jet of steam into the air. You will need a spanner to start these up. Its all up to you.

It goes without saying that most of them consisted of little more than boring figures and statistics. So you can just imagine my delight when Big Business fell onto my desk.
Up to three human or computer players can participate in the fun and each one begins the game with equal assets. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s then down to the individual to ensure that the company makes its fortune by the investment of money in research, development, production, advertising and most importantly, champagne!

Humourous screens are used to display and control the action, you can control the game using either the mouse, joystick or your keyboard.

Initially, Big Business is quite good fun and it really comes into its own in the multi-player mode. However, this is probably due to the humourous graphics, because after a while boredom sets in due to the repetitive nature of the gameplay. The high price is another stumbling block and it would have been better suited to the budget market.</resource>

Completely mouse-controlled, the game is divided in a series of non-scrolling screens, each one being a puzzle. The main objective is to move an anthropomorphic tomato from the left side of the screen to a conveyor belt on the right side. Several objects hinder progress by squishing, perforating, exploding and destroying the tomatoes. The player has an infinite number of them, but a time constraint is in place: a timer runs in the bottom left of the screen. The tomato movement can be started and stopped by clicking a semaphore on the bottom of the screen (the screen objects move independently, with their own timing). In order to solve the levels, you pick various gadgets at the bottom of the screen and place them according to your strategy. These gadgets are:

? An electric fan that can boost and alter your tomato's trajectory;

? A trampoline where the tomato can bounce and reach new heights;

? A Jack-In-The-Box to eject the tomato upwards;

? A blocking box to stop the tomato's movement.

There are also several types of bonuses to collect along the way, and many enemies and creatures (some flying) to fight off. The ultimate goal is to bring all the colored lamps back to the case, including the elusive Black Lamp.

The Black Lamp world is presented as a collection of rooms, all connected with ladders and/or doors, as well as outside areas where you must defend yourself by shooting or avoiding the attacking creatures.</resource>

Blade Warrior is a unique game in two ways, the most obvious being the graphics. Everything in this game is seen in silhouette - as you wander around looking for magical items and killing baddies, all you see is your silhouette and the silhouette of everything around you. The background is made up of a night sky, with clouds and hills.

Secondly, the game is an unusual mix of adventuring and battling. On your way to collecting magical items and exploring the huge ingame map, you're assaulted by baddies. Then, once you have collected certain artifacts, you can conjure up spells (so long as you have the recipe) back in your tower, trade with wizards for those all important tablet pieces and get clues to the next important artifacts.</resource>

The graphics are of a high standard - everything is suitably metallic and hi-tech but the front-end presentation is weak with no theme tune or loading screen. Craft control takes a little getting used to due to the high level of Inertia - it's much more apparent on this version than on the others - but practice makes perfect.

Blastaball should keep most Amiga owners happy for a while, though interest could soon be lost due to its simplistic concept; the game doesn't change much, it just gets harder.</resource>

The game features a full techno soundtrack, with 1 Megabyte of sound and 3 Megabytes of graphics - both high figures for an OCS game. The playing area totals 400 screens, with animated backgrounds

The main player is surrounded by a large tank which moves around as if you are walking it Flintstones style.

Gameplay follows the usual pattern for Ikari Warriors-style games - kill off the bazooka-toting baddies, which emerge from hiding places or enter the screen in waves. You can do this by either shooting them or running them over with your tank. Parts of the scenery often block your path and need destroying. Once you clear the level you are confronted by a boss, which in the first level is an enormous tank which you have to disable the guns of.

The game has a lot of similarities to Street Fighter II, for example, both had two characters with projectile, rising uppercut and spinning kick special moves and played identically (as with Ryu and Ken).

In order to advance to the next level, all bombs need to detonate. There are various sizes of bombs. Bigger ones have such a huge blast radius that Bombuzal cannot trigger them directly - instead, he has to explode smaller bombs first and cause a chain reaction. So as one might imagine, later levels turn into loud blastfests that need to be carefully planned.

Besides, later levels introduce all kinds of additional hazards and gimmicks, like ice floors, movable bombs, disappearing ground tiles, and much more. Nobody said being a pyromaniac is easy.

Breach 2 features turn-based combat from an isometric point of view set in the far future. As one of the more unique aspects the squad leaders gain experience from successful missions should they survive.

Breach 2 is set in the same sci-fi universe as Omnitrend's Universe and Rules of Engagement series and shares the same backstory with those games. Breach 2 is a part of the IGS (Interlocking Game System) and compatible with the two Rules of Engagement games. This means you can use Breach 2 to resolve the tactical combat situations, boarding an enemy ship for example, you run into in the starship command simulation, which is the heart and soul of the Rules of Engagement series.

A scenario builder is included with the game, making it possible to create your own missions and trade them.

    <resource id="4a0cf7cc4f2c44c2ec21309bd0b2177a53e1e2c0" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">In this game, you play Brian, the lion that closely resembles the Paddle Pop mascot. You must carry out the task of rescuing your friend Chris the Crystal, who has been kidnapped by Geeza the Dragon. His other warped jungle animal friends, Barry the Bear and Graeme the Gorilla, prevent you from getting to him and rescuing your friend.

Your job is to run through each level, destroying enemies that get in your way by either &amp;quot;clawing&amp;quot; them or jumping on their heads. Along the way, collect as many crystals as you can so that you can use them at the shop to buy extra lives, credits, heavenly hit points, jinormous jumps, really raj roars (which also kills enemies), and splendid speed. There are many secret areas in a level, some will take you on a different route other than the one you take when you reach the level exit. However, you must complete certain levels in order to progress further in the game, but you can return to a level that you have completed. You are given enough time to complete the level. If you run out of time before you reach the exit, you will receive no bonus. Furthermore, you do not get to access one of the three bonus levels that you can choose from if you do.</resource>

Each player controls either the vampire hunter Van Helsing or Count Dracula. Van Helsing has been summoned to the village of Bistritz to kill Dracula and his wives. His objective is to find thirteen tools to kill Dracula and bring them back to Helsing. For Dracula, the objective is to obtain thirteen wives by finding women, biting them and taking them back to the crypt, where thirteen coffins are lined up waiting for their recipients.nnSome of the dangers can only affect one of the characters (the ghouls only attack Van Helsing, while the priests and villagers only harm Dracula). Each player starts with three lives. Items and women collected are displayed at the bottom of the character window, along with the health bar. The game takes place in the churchyard and the adjacent village.</resource>

Bubba and Stix become friends and start on their journey home, They're now on an alien planet, things are a little bit different than they are on Earth. Take control of Bubba as he wields Stix as various puzzle solving tools (including a weapon), as they try to find a way back home. You'll have to solve mind-boggling puzzles and fight all kinds of wacky aliens if you're planning to return to Earth, so you'll have to have fast reflexes and be able to think fast and sometimes sideways.

You must guide Dizzy through the underwater worlds, collecting pearls as you go. Dizzy starts at the bottom of the sea, and you have to get him to the top. You do this by jumping across bubbles, which only have a limited time before bursting. Enemies to avoid include sharks, octopuses and swordfish. Dizzy has limited oxygen, but more can be collected from O2 canisters. 

After completing a level, you get a bonus for the amount of pearls you collected and the amount of oxygen you have left.

You are armed with bombs, mines, blockades, and various types of hatchlings, which when released will track the bugs and hopefully stop them.

The basic gameplay is inspired by Dynablaster, but it differs because there is more than one way to kill the foes off. Depending on which way you push the joystick as you press fire, you will either release a quick-exploding bomb, a proximity mine, or a hatchling. Collecting 'EN' symbols will restore your energy, and 'IQ' symbols increase the ability of your hatchlings to track and hit your foes. Be careful when placing blocks; it is possible to shut yourself in.</resource>

There are five different routes, offroad, north, east, west, south. The offroad course loops around back to the start, the others are long runs with a distinct beginning and ending. You must complete each leg before the time runs out.

Along the way you can pick up all kinds of bonuses. The colored flags are 30 points each, collect all colors in the order as indicated at the top of the screen to get 1000 bonus points. There are several gates the give you 100, 250 or 500 points, and a time gate. Drive through a time gate to collect it, you receive two seconds extra time upon completing a leg. Occasionally there will be a soccer ball on the road, hit it and it will fly away and you get 2000 points.

There are bridges and tunnels, be careful not to fall off the bridge into the water or crash into the tunnel wall. There also are obstacles like boulders, logs and fences. If you hit them it will cost you valuable seconds off your leg time. But if you hit a log or small stone just right, the buggy will ride on two wheels until you hit something again.</resource>

Each level has a visual background reflecting part of the country.

The route is mapped out beforehand, but it needn?t be strictly adhered to, as the surrounding roads are all presented and can be used as you wish. The computer cars in the race will often deviate from the course as well, adding real navigation to the proceedings. You accrue damage from contact, which needs to be repaired after the race, so you need to keep some prize money coming in. 

The racing is illegal, so you are pursued by police as you go, similarly to Crazy Cars 3, so make sure not to get caught, and do your dangerous driving out of their sight. You?ll have to drive on the correct side of the road and negotiate pedestrians and other traffic as well</resource>

The background graphics aren't very detailed, but the game's extremely fast-paced. The controls are quite precise, making the barriers at the top and bottom of the screen qutie imposing.

Two versions of the game exist, one from Electronic Zoo, and a budget one from Team 17, which had a few minor changes.

You control an advanced cybernetic aircraft carrier complete with fighters, amphibious assault vehicles, laser defenses and a fleet of decoy drones.  Your mission is to build a series of resource, factory, and defensive bases spanning an island chain.  The only problem?  At the other end of the chain is an even more advanced carrier under control of a terrorist organization with the same mission.

As you move around the islands you must decide what facilities to build and where they will best support your advance.  Resource islands provide materials that factory islands can use to build weapons and vehicles to replace your combat losses but both will be quickly overrun if the enemy attacks them while you are not present.  You also have to ensure that your stockpiles of equipment are stored safely until you can find time to launch a resupply drone to bring them to your carrier.

From your carrier, you can take first person control of your attack aircraft and amphibious tanks and use them to assault enemy islands or even the enemy carrier itself if you're lucky enough to find it.  The weapon payloads on your vehicles are completely configurable based on your needs.  An island invasion may require launching a virus bomb that will take over the enemy command systems or just blasting the base with a wire guided surface to surface missile.

Ultimately, you have to find and destroy the enemy carrier but, doing so will require a solid supply infrastructure and a strategy for depriving your opponent of his.

As a Prince or Princess armed with a slingshot, you have to explore a medieval castle to free your beloved from the evil Magister. 

Gameplay combines action and puzzle-solving, across four primary towers with three levels each. Doors must be opened using one of the ten included keys. These are unmarked, as are the various potions - making it a challenge to know which keys open which doors, and which potions are beneficial. 

Contact with ghouls drains your energy, as does falling too far (there are narrow pathways to negotiate), while eating cheese can replenish this. Movement and aiming are controlled separately.

Both launched from a carrier during Operation Desert Storm, you receive your missions and carry them out.

The usual options apply, like configuring your aircraft, and choosing a pilot, but there are some more unusual options, like calling in sick for a mission. This causes you to skip a mission if you don't like the sound of it, but if you use it too much command may get suspicious.

The flight model is realistic, and there are some animations. One feature missing from the PC version is the strategic side - you control the ground operations while flying to support them on the Amiga version.

Play is for one or two players simultaneously (including a battle-mode), and options are available for mouse and joystick controls. A comprehensive level editor is also included.

The playersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ bat here is made out to look like a bone, and the ball is a spherical stone. Level backdrops are randomised pixel-painted scenes featuring different types of Dinosaurs. 

The bricks to knock out sometimes contain pickups to collect, such as a laser gun, an automatic CPU controlled bat navigation mode, extra life, slow-ball etc. A pickup is immediately activated upon collection, but subsequent ones collected are not if one is active, and clicking the right mouse button will cancel out the current effect for the last pickup collected.

A bonus coconut game can be enabled from the main menu, which in turn lets you play this sub-game at predefined intervals during the course of standard play, where you control a caveman holding a pan, and the object is to catch coconuts that fall from trees with it, by moving from left to right on the single screen. Your bonus is tallied for how many coconuts you managed to catch in the allotted time.</resource>

Responding to the distress call, you hurry to save a spaceship, a space station which has had its reactor put on self-destruct to prevent the station from falling into the enemies hands, and the lunar base that have become infested with Creatures.

The spaceship, although seemingly abandoned by the Creature, has inside, guard dogs and beastoids that fire weapons. They were left behind by their master. You must survive their attack to find life-sustaining supplies and the key to disarm the reactor. Upon receiving these, you must safely return to your ship to start your journey to the terror-filled space station. The space station has much greater danger. You must gather more essential supplies, but more importantly, you must disarm the reactor before it self-destructs. You have the key, but where is the reactor? Once this step of your mission has been done, you must make your way back out while trying to get past the alien attack droids, acid leaks, and more vicious beastoids.</resource>

When Inspector Raoul Dusentier is invited to a cruise upon a mighty sailing ship by the wealthy businessman Niklos Karaboudjan, he looks forward to nothing but a relaxing week on the sea. Instead, his host manages to get himself killed on the second day. Murdered, to be exact. Too convenient that a policeman is aboard -- Dusentier sets out to search for suspects. He doesn't need to search long. Why is it that none of the family members seem awfully sad about the demise of the old man? Is the mysterious Father Fabiani really as pious as he says? In the tradition of Agatha Christie, each and every person on board has a motive for the murder.</resource>

The game is similar to Gaunlet, and levels must be completed within a time limit which changes based on level complexity. In order to complete levels, the player has to locate and collect the five crystals and then find and use the exit. Walls, enemies, and other obstacles will impede the player throughout the game and players much maintain a supply of energy units or their game will come to an end. Players can select between two characters at the start of each level. The two characters have different qualities and limitations which make them more or less adept to each different level.</resource>

The robot Cytron has been sent into a research facility in which robots have gone berserk, and it must safeguard the area and rescue the trapped scientists.

The character control is skittish, meaning that the droid is hard to stop instantly, which makes progression through the levels harder. One unusual feature is that the droid can be split into town components, Cyt and Ron, in a manner similar to Head Over Heels. This comes in useful when switches must be activated in a part of the level away from the force-field they unlock, as Cyt can be sent to flick the switch so that Ron can progress through the level as soon as it is flicked.

You are the brave adventurer taking on this quest through 14 increasingly-tough zones.

The bulk of the game is side-viewed, involving single screens to pass through, which incorporate ropes, cages and trapdoor. There are enemies walking, flying and hovering through this, and many of them respawn. Unusually your weapon to take them on (rocks) can be thrown through 360 degrees, which aims to make the gameplay more realistic and methodical. The screens were linked by hub screens, which the player passes through simply by clicking on a door.

The tanks can move quickly, make sharp turns or fire in all the directions.

The graphics in 3D are very well done for a 1990 game.
Even if the game has a rather simplistic plot it can get quickly very addictive.

Now, they have Energy Collection Devices collectively known as EGOs, and hope to stock them up to use towards the Zephyr One device, and direct its energy at the planet Evath, resulting in a catastrophic radiation overload. 

Your mission is to beam onto their base on the moon Tricuspid, and destroy the EGOs. Destroying one will buy you more of your limited time. The problem is, many are connected to at least 2 others, and those can immediately regenerate, so you must tackle them in an order in which those with only 1 connection are attacked first.

You are inside a space suit, propelled by a Jet Pack with limited fuel, and possess lasers and a shield. Shield energy is limited, but can be recharged through pentagons and rods. In a world viewed through the the Freescape 3D system, you roam the verdant planet of trees, buildings and underground tunnels.

Gameplay has more action than Driller. The Freescape world has a third dimension - due to the jetpack you can leave the ground and look down on the view. You can also rotate the angle and make quick U-turns. You must leave the ground to shoot the active part of an ECD, but the jetpack uses energy at a faster rate, so use this feature sparingly. You must avoid Plexors, which weaken your shield, and deflector devices, which can beam you into prison.

In this side-scrolling platformer, the player controls Darkman, a superhero who can jump, kick and punch, as well as swing from a rope during action sequences between levels. In each level, Darkman disguises himself as the boss of the level, whom he must defeat before the time limit elapses. Tying into the plot of the film, Darkman wears masks of various gangsters who are responsible for his disfigurement, but his disguise dissolves after being exposed to sunlight for too long. The character changes into a different member of the evil gang in each level, taking on their attack moves as well as their face.

In-between levels, Darkman must photograph his quarry before he can make a mask of them. These scenes involve moving the cursor to take a picture of the gangster. The better the photo accuracy, the more time Darkman is granted to complete the subsequent level. The final level is the most faithful to the film, and takes place on a skyscraper under construction.</resource>

You play Mike Dawson, an ad company manager who, in pursuit of his goal in life to become a writer, purchases a solitary mansion in a small town called Woodland Hills. Although the low cost and hush-hush transactions when purchasing the house do raise your suspicion, the solitary environment and sheer beauty of the house crush common sense and you decide to buy the house. That's when trouble begin. Upon reaching the house, you suddenly feel tired. You find a bed and fall asleep...

... and wake up from a terrible dream, only to find out that your life has just become a worse nightmare: an unknown source has implanted a seed of darkness in your mind, and you only have three days to find a way to stop it.</resource>

Your basic task is to pick up each of the 8 pods in turn, and carry them through a portal elsewhere in the level, before going back for another one. 

There are power-ups available, representing an auto-fire (Surely one of the earliest software implementations of this), extra simultaneous lasers, missiles to home in on the Landers as they attack, a level-skip, and a Super Shield.

As standard in Defender games, Lander craft are also there to pick up the pods, and these must be stopped before reaching the top of the screen, as both the Lander and Pod become fearsome enemies if they do. If you shoot the Lander, the pod drops back to the ground, for you to retrieve. Unusually, you don't have to wait for the Lander to attack before picking up a pod. 

You must shoot all enemies to progress to the next level, at which point you get a bonus for the number of remaining pods. Every four levels the pods are replenished, which means that losing them on the first of each set of 4 levels (1,5,9,13 etc.) reduces your next four bonuses. If you don't save at least one pod on each level, your will have to face tougher enemies, and without your shield being replenished.

As a lone commando, your job is to rescue New York City from various gangs that are wrecking havoc. Each stage takes place in a nondescript New York location, with varied backdrops and excellent attention to detail.

What makes New York Warriors a lot of fun is the variety of enemies and weapons you can pick up and use. The gangs that control each location also have their own attack styles and weapons, and naturally the challenge increases with each location you advance. Another high point is the fact that each mission's objective is different: in some locations, all you have to do is get from point A to B without getting killed, while in others you may be asked to secure a bridge by destroying guarding tanks. The action is furious, and user controls are responsive.

Fans of Cabal and similar commando-type shooters should really enjoy this one, although don't expect it to be a groundbreaking title.</resource>

    <resource id="ac2f42d411d170a1dbcd96ca28f197bdd5ad9e93" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Disc is a game of fast reflexes and clever thinking. You control one player against the computer or another person. The objective is to finish off your opponents by knocking him off the platforms or by making the platform disappear by hitting the walls behind your opponents. Your weapon is a disc, which you can throw at your opponent or at the walls. The disc will ricochet off the walls, opening a wide range of angles and attacks. You can also try a direct hit at your opponents, as enough of these will eliminate him as well, but be careful - since it gives him a chance to block your disc, thus gain control of it!
As you progress through the levels, from Novice, through Disciple, up to a Great Guide, your rivals become tougher, platforms take longer hits to disappear, and there are more discs on the playing field.

Your aim as the &amp;quot;Doodlebug&amp;quot; is to make your way through five different levels (with three sub-levels each), killing baddies by jumping on their heads until you eventually make it to the final baddie.

The most unique thing about this game is the novel theme at its centre: You can choose between five different coloured pencils to throw at your baddies (presuming you've picked some up). If the pencil's flight path is uninterrupted then they'll draw a useful item for you: Either an Umbrella (for long falls), Ball (to be able to jump onto higher platforms), a Potion (invincibility), a Clock (stops time) and an Eraser (kills everything on screen).</resource>

The goal is to solve a hundred levels in order to become the new king. The dragon is affected by gravity which results in the need to counter-steer to avoid falling to the ground. Getting hit lowers the life energy and running out results in a game over because there is only on life available.

Between levels the player visits a town in which power ups like weapon upgrades or life energy are purchased. However, there is also the need to save for the trip to the next of overall 25 towns. The money is earned by shooting enemies in the levels or participating in dice games in the local tavern.</resource>

To do so, the player must hatch, raise, breed dragons, and use them to spread terror and power across the land! Use these dragons and spells to conquer or help numerous villages and cities across the land while devastating the other wizards also seeking control of the land.

Dragon Lord introduces different levels of gameplay, which may be categorized as the following:nnAlchemynnThe game introduces a complex process of alchemy. Different ingredients have positive and negative results in combination of different types of Magick equipment used for it. Use alchemy to strengthen (or even weaken) own dragons or use them to cast spells at surrounding villages and cities (as well as some alchemical spells for the player's own benefit). Creating a too powerful spell in the Magick Laboratory may introduce an unpleasant explosion in the lab. Ingredients may be obtained through villager tribute or purchase from traveling merchants. 

Note: The game is almost impossible to play without the Alchemical Table of Ingredients.

Dragon BreedingnnThe player may breed several individual dragons in the castle. Each require nurturing and patience before they can hatch and even more so after they hatch! Use alchemy spells to help strengthen the dragon eggs (or they may not hatch at all!).

Dragon Missions and Political MapnnThis feature gives a top-down perspective of the political map around the land. Send dragons to wreck havoc and terror to the surrounding villages and cities, or use them to explore the region and even protect villages and cities from enemy dragons! Attacking villages and cities may prompt them to surrender themselves under the player's control, providing the damage done is sufficient enough. This is also where the player may control the taxation of villages and cities (under player control) as well as any other information regarding them.

Dragon Combat!
Though optional, the player may enter manual combat (as to automatic combat) and enter a top-down, side-scrolling (vertical) arcade combat when attacking villages or cities. Here the player basically uses a dragon to burn anything that remotely looks like a structure.

Note: If there is an enemy dragon near the area, the enemy dragon will come to the defense of that village or city!</resource>

On an island far away, their lords prepare for the conquest of the lands. There is only one hope for mankind. The emperor sends out four heroes -- warriors and magicians -- to solve the puzzle of tears and prevent the invasion of the Drakkhen.

Drakkhen is a role-playing game with a visual presentation that combines 3D landscapes and 2D interiors. The player's party will travel overland on a flat terrain made up of vectors, on which 2D objects are zoomed (The same type of engine was later used in Eternam). The player will encounter monsters and fight them in real-time combat, and discover the palaces of the dragon lords. Indoors, the player has to find a way through the maze of chambers, solving puzzles and defeating the minions of the Drakkhen. Party members are depicted in four status windows on the left side of the screen, thus allowing to see their current status and equipment at once.</resource>

The gameplay is reminiscent of the 3D dungeon crawl type of role-playing games popularized by Wizardry and The Bard's Tale. However, unlike these games, Dungeon Master features real-time combat, which requires the player to click on the opponent in order to execute an attack. Another notable aspect of the game is its growth system: instead of gathering experience points and leveling up, characters improve by repeatedly using the same action. Spellcasting involves selecting and combining symbols, which can be arranged as rune sequences. The game also allows the player to directly interact with objects in the game world through a point-and-click interface.

Bomberman's job is to save her, battling the sea of the enemies, with only bombs at his disposal.

The range of Bomberman's bomb explosions can be upgraded with time, but if he dies, the range resets back to the minimum range and Bomberman loses his previous skills. Some updates can make Bomberman walk through the walls, increase his speed, and give him some other assets to aid him in his quest to save the woman he loves.

This top-down action-arcade game consists of nine levels per stage, each tougher than the other, and each final one consisting of the boss that will have to be dealt with. Bomberman can move horizontally and vertically and lay down bombs behind him, thus evaporating the enemies, but beware: Bomberman can block himself with his own bomb, and thus become a victim of his own bomb.</resource>

Being able to use direct-combat moves as well as collecting bonus weapons, and food for energy recharging, is pretty typical as well. Games of this type that were converted from the arcade to home computers are particularly commonplace - Renegade and the Double Dragon series are famous examples.

Where this one stands out, however, is the setting of your character as a duck called Bin (and his red buddy Pin), and with motion having a clear waddling appearance. The enemies to fight are all from the animal kingdom, but somewhat warped - crocodiles with boxing moves and cows armed with rocket packs for example. Bin has six levels to clear before he can rescue Lucy from Achacha's clutches.</resource>

Police officers who are promoted to this unit wear a cyber-suit that contains state-of-the-art military equipment including two Turbo-Booster Thrusters, extra ammunition, and increased protection. In order to become an ESWAT member, all a dedicated police officer has to do is arrest enough criminal masterminds to progress through the ranks, which include Captain, Assistant Chief, and Chief.

ESWAT: Cyber Police is a horizontal-scrolling beat 'em up where you have to make your way from left to right and defeat a mastermind. There are 15 stages to complete, and have you patrolling through Liberty streets, car yards, stadiums, restaurants, the CBD, construction sites, and boat docks. While you're out on patrol, you can pick up ammunition, and the amount you get varies. For example, on some levels, ammo may be worth 10 bullets, while in others, you may get 60 bullets. Once you have obtained the cyber-suit, you wear it for the duration of the game.</resource>

Like most child-oriented licenses of the day, his first computer outing was a platform game, scrolling vertically and resembling Rainbow Islands, although much simplified.

Edd must progress up the levels within the time limit (water will come up to drown him - presumably polluted water through which a duck can't swim), while collecting every star. Bad guys can be stunned by shooting them, which makes them safe to touch, although nothing other than Edd actually dies. The levels are all themed around particular areas of the BBC offices, including a sci-fi set and the weather room.

    <resource id="fa33fe296393795d0f42b1b75e01c301337520fc" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Elfmania is a Fighting game, developed by Terramarque and published by Renegade, which was released in Europe in 1994.

Beautiful, colourful or cute things can often be the most dangerous - they can lull you into a false sense of security and then striking out when least expected, stunning you like a rocket-charged python. Elfmania is such a thing. Who would have thought, after Streetfighter 2, Body Blows and Mortal Kombat, that what's basically a bunch of fighting fairies would inspire an office into aggressive bouts of one-on-one fisticuffs and high-pitched screaming.

In single-player mode you start off with cash in the form coins which buy the services of fighters. More experienced ones cost more dosh, so at the beginning you can only choose between one of three characters, who cost $75 each. Beating the hell out of each enemy (in a very nice elf-like fashion, of course) gives you more coins, allowing you to hire tougher fighters for later bouts.

In two-player mode you can have a quick flick through the fighters and, well, I never knew that elves had such a varied racial culture. There's a sumo wrestling Japanelf, a vicious and contemptible sword wielding Turkelf and a king equipped with a fiendishly destructive mallet. These three constitute the toughest enemies, but because everyone is yours for a price, if you win enough bouts, you can hire these fighters later on in the game.

Okay, a cute beat 'em up might sound perverse, but Elfmania has managed to prove two things: 1.) Consoles are not the only place you can find decent beat 'em ups. 2.) You don't have to rip anyone's head off, have blood spouting everywhere and have special moves that are about as easy to execute as an American mass murderer to produce a top class, strategic and fun game. Very well done.</resource>

The player initially controls a character referred to as &amp;quot;Commander Jameson&amp;quot;, starting at Lave Station with 100 credits and a lightly armed trading ship called Cobra Mark III. Most of the game consists of traveling to various star systems, trading with their inhabitants, gaining money and reputation. Money can also be gained by other means beside trading; these include undertaking military missions, bounty hunting, asteroid mining, and even piracy. As the player character earns money, he becomes able to upgrade his ships with enhancements such as better weapons, shields, increased cargo capacity, an automated docking system, etc.</resource>

    <resource id="c07be9837ac3e752e941df8d9f9470277a50caa6" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">The scene chosen for this adventure, the first one of the &amp;quot;Ci-U-Than&amp;quot; trilogy, is the Yucatan, a mysterious land in which legends say there are a lot of dangers, hidden treasures, unsolved mysteries, temples filled with traps... in short, the ingredients to which the good adventurer is used to deal with.

The adventure is developed in the island of Cozumel, where you must guide an archaeologist who had an incident. He was sailing towards it perfectly equipped, when an unfortunate shipwreck left him without anything. Do not think he only lost the map or the machete, no, he lost everything, including the trousers and the underclothes, reason why it's quite possible that an entrance in San Marcos, coastal town near the place of the shipwreck, would carry serious problems with the justice. The main mission of the adventure is to discover all the hidden secrets of the island and then be able to escape from it.

This game uses the habitual commands of the previous AD adventures, plus the inclusion of some PSI characters, it means, personages with own personality, decision capacity, different behavior according to the development of the adventure, that is, personages who must be treated as if they were real since their reactions can vary from a game to another. Some improvements like the objects treatment system have been incorporated (which include all their qualities); a better graphical detail; a score system that it indicates you which actions are positive and which negative, etc.

    <resource id="178fbc2d9977878f2cc4c6f24d6e8787d6997c15" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Race a single computer opponent for first place on a unique racetrack -- 100 feet in the air! You start in the fourth three-man division of a league, all racing each other twice, and must come top to progress. The action is viewed from within the car throughout the 3-lap races, with the distance between you always on screen.

Jump chasms, jumps, and drawbridges; take banks hard or slow; pass your opponent on the track or while catching mass air. Your car has the ability to burn a limited amount of turbo boost fuel as a way to accelerate faster and achieve higher speeds, but don't use it all up at once or you'll fall behind. Don't damage your engine too much; severe dents will show up during your next race.

Whatever you do, don't fall off the track, as this will cost you time as you are placed back on.</resource>

    <resource id="28f297734ca25deb2b8aa2364f844c6ff1a96148" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">AMC is a 2D game with horizontal scrolling in 2 phases (typical of Spanish games), in the same style as Gryzor. In the first phase, one plays a commando that is sent on the planet DENDAR to trap the ship of the Death Bringers, the bearers of death. There are 11 different enemies to meet you, and Krauer, the Death Bringers leader who protects the ship and is 4 meters tall.

The game starts with a single shot, then the weapon is expanded over the game, we pick up weapons more and more powerful. Note that the contents of the crates sent from the sky by the Astro Marine can be changed by the Death Bringers, so you can die suffocated by green carnivorous plants.

Phase 2 of the game takes you to the Death Bringers ship that drops you on their planet, and you have to exterminate them in a limited time, and contains 13 different enemies and the end boss, Great King Alien.</resource>

But this time, you're not alone. The princess you saved back then has taken up a sword and joined your cause! Now, it's more than a death match. You have to explore into the many tunnels in his dungeon, defeat the dangerous monsters that come between you and cold steel to Drax's throat.

The game has similar game play to the original, but with a different challenge. Various monsters will come and attack you, but each have different approaches in order to defeat them. For example, You can't overhead chop a monster that's shorter than your axe. There are 4 levels of dungeons to explore before you reach Drax at the final stage.</resource>

    <resource id="7974c92d92875921ba2d2819a4055a87701525fa" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Breach is a turn-based tactical squad combat game. It introduces the team-oriented missions, RPG-style squad leader development and excellent scenario builder that would grow to be trademarks and would be refined in the sequels Breach 2 and Breach 3.

In the ten missions supplied with the retail version (and potentially infinitely more created with the included scenario builder), a squad of usually five space marines under the command of a squad leader embarks on sci-fi missions that involve hostage rescue, data retrieval or simply elimination of opponents. Squad members advance and act in turn on basis of a movement point system. 

The multi-level maps consist of outside terrain and structures with several stories, connected by lifts, filled with enemies and objects. Squad members can find and use weapons such as grenades, rockets or detonation packs and tools such as Medikits, scanners or shields.

In an unique twist, the squad leader advances from mission to mission (while the rest of the team is always new), improving his basic stats with each successfully completed assignment, based on his performance. Only experienced leaders may attempt STAR-rated scenarios. If the squad leader gets killed, he is lost forever: the game deletes the corresponding leader file.

    <resource id="7db487076eb98c2302f62c9d75e250a52635dc07" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">This is the original Microids title, which was exclusively used with the releases for the French game market. Released outside France under a different title, Hot Rubber by Titus UK.

Grand Prix 500 2 is your standard bike racing scenario, featuring a handful of riders racing hell for leather around the most famous courses of the world, pausing only to collect medals and shake champagne all over each other.

I must admit, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m a very big fan of bike racing games. From Team Suzuki to Super Hang On, I always have my eye out for a new one. This is quite definitely the most appalling one I have ever seen. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s completely unplayable in every respect, with a useless two player mode and some of the smallest player windows ever seen.

You begin as always on the starting grid and at this point things look really good. The graphics are fine and detailed and everything looks fairly realistic. Then the light turns green and the other riders hit the horizon in about three hops. Push forward to get moving and you hit this gameÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s big problem. Rather than have you at the centre of the screen with the road swinging around as you change lanes, the programmers obviously decided that that was too much hassle, and opted for the other side of the coin, which involves the road being centred and the sprite of the bike moving around unrealistically. The result of this is that itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s impossible to judge corners correctly, and as for overtaking - forget it.

This is one useless game. Even as a budget title, it just isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t worth the disk itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s recorded on.</resource>

Despite bearing the name of one of Germany's best players, the game's scope is not as large as the likes of Champion Manager; instead, the game focuses on tactics and action-oriented gameplay where you can control each player directly. The game strikes a good balance between action and tactics, although neither element is as good as the best of each camp. Choose to lead your favorite club from five European countries (England, France, Italy, Spain, and Germany) in a friendly match, league, or cup play. Overall, Lothar MatthÃƒÂ¤us is a decent beer-and-pretzel soccer simulation/action game that doesn't take itself too seriously. Good as a quick fix, but lacking in long-term play value to warrant repeated play.</resource>

    <resource id="f81fc20bb1f4b7b0edc8397b15ce8633c8f36eb5" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Magic Johnson's Basketball is a decent arcade-style basketball game starring LA Lakers' superstar Magic Johnson, one of the most famous players of all time. It is a direct translation of the popular coin-op arcade game called Magic Johnson's Fastbreak Basketball. Like the arcade original, the game is easy enough for beginners to learn, and challenging enough for experts. You can play against the computer or another human opponent in a hot-seat mode.

As an arcade-oriented game, Magic Johnson's Basketball is pretty good. You can shoot 3-pointers, perform slam dunks, and of course Magic Johnson's famous fast break with a slam dunk finish. The game includes a good training sequence, demo mode, and smooth animation.

When compared with other basketball games made during the same period, Magic Johnson's Basketball falls flat with many limitations. You can only play a single game, unlike the entire season that Ed Ringler's Omni-Play Basketball (also a Magic Johnson-promoted game) simulates. And the on-court action is far from the fun of EA's 1988 classic One on One: Jordan vs. Bird. Without the competition, Magic Johnson's Basketball would have been considered a great game. But basketball fans simply have many better choices to choose from than this game.</resource>

Options are limited: the player can select the starting eleven, the players being rated in both ability and fitness, explore the transfer market for signing better players and request overdraft extensions. While no player refuses the sign for your team (even if it's still on the Conference), the real game challenge is to balance finances, and avoid paying too much in wages while still in the lower divisions.</resource>

    <resource id="7fc6feea34c4d2ab238990f808bed7400aab8e7e" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Downhill Challenge is a Sports game, developed by MicroÃƒÂ¯ds and published by BrÃƒÂ¸derbund Software, which was released in Europe in 1989.



An avalanche of unanswered questions buries Downhill Challenge before the skiier gets a third of the way down the hill. The game attempts to simulate slalom skiing, downhill skiing, giant slalom skiing, and ski jumping.



You had better know the rules of these Nordic events already, because the skimpy manual is little help. I was left wondering: How does the program keep time in the downhill events? What do the splits mean and where are they taken? What is the penalty for missing a gate? How many times do you go downhill in the competition mode (thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also one for practice) before you can move on to the next event? Besides pressing the Shift key or joystick button for extra height, how do you control the skiier while jumping?



At least you have above average graphics to look at while you ponder. The scenery you ski toward but never quite reach is nearly breathtaking. The viewpoint of the game is from about 15 feet behind the skiier. The game would come alive much better if it actually put you up on the skis with perhaps only your poles showing in each hand, and if it didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t sound as if you have a motor attached to your back after the starting bell.</resource>

Play as all four of the turtle heroes, rescue April, and then rescue your sensei Splinter from Mecha-Turtles clutches than go after The Shredder deep in the bowels of The Technodrome itself.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is an action game based on the late eighties/early nineties cartoon series of the same name. Play as Leonardo, Michaelangelo, Donatello and Raphael (one turtle only, but the ability to swap between turtles at any time) as you save your friends and battle The Shredder and his cronies. There are no 'lives', as such - when you lose a turtle, he becomes 'captured', and you cannot use him again until you rescue him from a place hidden in the overworld.

Gameplay takes place in two perspectives: a top-down view, which lets you run around and explore buildings, sewers and other places. When entering places from the top-down view, the perspective shifts to a side-scrolling view, where most of the battling takes place. In addition to each turtle's main weapon, sub-weapons (such as shuriken) can be acquired, to use at foes - these have a limited use.

Select one of the five most intrepid Adventurers from England, France, Germany, Japan, and the U.S. to spearhead the search. Professor Renegade was last seen in the unexplored region of the highest Tibetan ranges; an area populated by creatures and conditions of the professor's own design: venomous stone snakes, reptilian birds, and acid storms. Not only must your Adventurer survive these tests of courage, but he must and properly use such curious objects as spurs, a vacuum cleaner, and a unicycle. Once you locate the professor and convince him to help, you'll need to help him construct an anti-asteroid deflector to prevent the destruction of earth.</resource>

    <resource id="e65e0f5a5cd5b2a9854643a86c8d3e4c50ef20e1" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Doug Quaid is a mild-mannered construction worker with a gorgeous wife in an apartment on futuristic Earth.  Plagued by restless feelings and dreams of Mars, he heads to Rekall, Inc to purchase a commercial memory implant of a Martian vacation (&amp;quot;cheaper, better, and safer than the real thing&amp;quot;). However, the implant procedure uncovers latent memories of Quaid's real life as a secret agent for the Martian government. Pursued relentlessly by his former employers, Quaid must fight from Earth to Mars in a battle to reclaim his past and secure his future.

Total Recall for the Amiga and Atari ST has players controlling Quaid as he fights through seven levels on Earth and Mars.  The game alternates between platforming levels and driving levels.  Platforming levels require Quaid to fight guards and find the exit. The player can duck to avoid bullets, and fight back with both captured weapons and meaty Schwarzenegger fists. The first level requires the player to locate items to open the exit, and a later level has the player switching control between Quaid and resistance fighter Melina to solve a puzzle.

Driving levels are high-speed side-scrolling runs, with the player's vehicle moving at a fixed speed.  The player must dodge passing traffic, or blow them apart with weapons. If they survive to the end, they must defeat a mobile &amp;quot;boss&amp;quot; vehicle to end the level.  Cutscenes appear between certain levels that tell the plot of the movie and set up the next scene.

(Also known as 'Og') was the second game Dave Parsons of Confused Pelican wrote for the Amiga. It was a fairly short, sideways-scrolling game in the Wonderboy style. It used pixel-perfect collision detection routines and ran in 32-colour mode. He revisited it later and made a much more colourful AGA version which had 64 colours, much smoother sky colours and screen fades, and a 1-bit parallax background layer. Outside of the game itself, it's really not very polished, and has pretty awful music.</resource>

    <resource id="e7e8028684bb18ccccedc1e39480042b79146588" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Based around a classic motor car race from either side of the war, 1000 Miglia (literally '1000 miles') is an unusual racing game. You have to progress across Italy through a number of stages in your rickety 20s car. Keeping within time limits at each point is crucial to staying in the game. 

At the beginning of the game, you can choose the spare parts that you will take with yourself in case your car breaks down. You also choose a car and set up the skills for your two drivers; you can distribute points between Skill, Resistance and Mechanics, and choose the driver's favorite part of the race. 

Atmospheric conditions change throughout the race: sometimes the weather will be clear, sometimes you'll have to drive through rain or mist. During the race, your car will sometimes lose a wheel or need other repairs. If this happens, you'll lose a couple of minutes repairing it - as long as you have the appropriate spare part; if you don't have one, it's game over!</resource>

You cannot beat the feeling of power money brings, and there is plenty of money to be made in the A1200 version of 1869. It is the late 19th Century and the world is wracked with civil wars and international conflicts. In many ways, there has never been a more exciting time to launch a business venture.

You play the owner of a fledgling shipping company and you have to use your skills as a tactician and businessman to exploit the various trading situations around the world. If you succeed then your business expands, but if you fail, you could end up losing more than just your livelihood.

The A1200 version of this game does not actually seem to be that much different from the original version â€“ you get the same brief animation sequences and humorous interludes. You even listen to the same irritatingly nautical chip music. However, 1869 can be best appreciated in multi-player mode with you and up to three other pals battling it out for the ultimate control of the high seas.

If you're heavily into 19th century nautical history, or play on an Amiga with other enlightened beings, and the idea of pretending to be a hard-nosed, back-stabbing, scrupulous capitalist appeals to you, then go buy this game. Just be prepared to play like a real Thatcherite.</resource>

On the main menu there are four icons as well as some major information such as the player's name, the name of the player's club, current league position, a rating, and the account balance.

The first icon from left is the picture of a computer and by clicking on it you will get to the main database menu where you can handle the playersâ€™ training, studying the coming fixtures and edit the teams or players. The second icon is a telephone and by clicking on it and you will be able to make a phone call to either the transfer market (for buying and selling players) or the the bank (to get a loan). The third icon is a notebook and by clicking on it you will see tables from all four divisions. The last icon is the picture of a football pitch and by pressing it you will get to your next match. After choosing your squad you will see the highlights of the match from a top-down perspective.

After the match you will get reports about players being injured, results in the other matches, and the finances for that week.</resource>

The main playing menu consists of two parts: the space map with all planets (either in animated 3D or a top-down view) and the menu with up to four commands. The basic gist is that the lords need to visit owned planets in order to adjust their production focus: space ships are used to defend planets and fuel is required to move them around the empire.

More planets are acquired by attacking them. The result is calculated automatically and is based on the amount of defending respectively attacking troops. A special case comes into effect when a space lord is currently on the attacked planet: the winner of the fight instantly receives all the loser's planets. A lord is permanently removed from the game after the second personal defeat; the goal is to unite all planets under O'Connor's rule. Sometimes there is an action sequence in which the player has to move the space ship (by clicking on cursor keys) in order to avoid obstacles.</resource>

Seen from a first-person cockpit perspective and utilizing flat-shaded polygonal graphics, waves of aliens advance towards the player and must be destroyed with a laser cannon. Unlike in the originals, the aliens never shoot back: the only danger they pose is that of crashing into the player. If any aliens from a wave survive an attack run by not being destroyed before they pass the player, they will try again and again, until either the entire wave or the player is destroyed. The alien formations change every four waves, but not before a bonus stage involving navigating an asteroid field is passed.</resource>

The moves on offer include all the uppercuts and hooks of a real fight, and the players are designed to move realistically to implement them.

You progress through the game by taking on a succession of increasingly difficult fighters, and get to train your boxer in between. Advanced action replays are included as well, so you can review all that happened.</resource>

    <resource id="d4447e7fb84b694ae9046f6dd5b84d9e3afb0a68" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Like other sports games by Bob Whitehead, 4th &amp; Inches was hailed upon release, combining the action of previous titles with the new feature of strategic play calling. For the first time in a computer football game, players could choose from a number of plays. The player initially designated a formation, and then selected one of five plays based on the formation. These plays included a great number of offensive strategies, including draws, curls, sweeps and long bombs, among others. Defensive tactics equally were varied, with the player being able to choose a defensive formation based on what they thought the opponent would attempt.



The game required the player to select a position to control before the play began while on offense, but were not able to switch control during the action. Because there was a limited area of the field in view at any one time, it occasionally prevented the player from seeing important parts of the play develop. Rather than scrolling smoothly when the player being controlled would reach the edge of the screen, as modern football simulations do, it re-drew the visible section of the field entirely, placing the controlled player in a new position on the screen. While on defense, the player being controlled could not be changed either, but would be automatically selected as the player closest to the offensive ball carrier on each screen redraw.</resource>

There are four completely different types of course, each taking place on a different surface - Mud, Ice, Desert and Mountains. Each of these is littered with hazards, which can either be painstakingly avoided, or driven through (with the resultant risk of damage).</resource>

In addition, boards come in various diamond sizes, color textures and with obstacle stones. A (generous) time limit exerts soft pressure.

In the wake of Alexey Pajitnov's block-busting Tetris, Infogrames licensed another Russian mathematician's concept for a game of logics and dexterity: Two players start from opposite ends of a board, filled with rectangles of seven different colors, and take turns in picking one of these colors. All diamonds of that color bordering on the player's territory are annexed, expanding the borders. Whoever first controls more than half of the terrain wins.</resource>

9 Lives is a platform game taking in four levels. The lengths of jumps are variable, depending on how long the joystick is pushed down for. Bonus items to be collected include rotor blades, to allow flight. 

Bob cannot kill his enemies, but can temporarily stun them, by hurling his ball of string at them. Contact with enemies or hazards causes an energy bar to decrease - a life is lost once it reaches zero. As the title suggests, this can happen eight times before a ninth death ends the game.

Another goal is to provide the impetus for a chosen city to develop. There are a number of different places to set up business each with different layouts and existing houses and businesses.

The main money earners are passenger trains, that can be scheduled to pick up passengers at the times of day when the demand is high. However, in the long term you need the city to develop. This requires setting up trains that transport resources to where they are needed. These resources are used to build houses, and other buildings, increasing the number of passengers for commuter trains.

As the city develops, new businesses will spring up, such as stadiums, high rise office blocks, and ski resorts. The player may also build own businesses, the success of which will depend on the local population, the presence of competing businesses, and even the changes of the seasons, among other factors.

The stock market is also another way of making money. The player may also watch the seasons come and go, with snow visible in winter, and fireworks displays celebrating the New Year.</resource>

Most of the time, while exploring the over world, the game is shown in a 2D top-down view. It gives you much freedom: there's more to do than just stick to the main quest. Towns have a static interface where you reach the wished location by pressing the according symbol. e.g. a church for healing up or a sage for hints.

During dungeon crawls the game switches to a 3D view and plays similar to Dungeon Master. As usual for this kind of games you see the dungeon in a small windows while your characters are shown on the right hand side of the screen. Dungeon sequences are completely in real-time. This includes combat which basically consists of clicking on a character's weapon or magic spell and then clicking on the monster. After every usage of a weapon/spell you have to wait a certain time until you can use it again.</resource>

Players take the role of a student at an academy for advanced piloting. There they need to solve 20 simulated missions on a wide range of planets.

The self-contained missions mean that the game uses the Tau Ceti structure and theme, without the causality of previous decisions having an effect on later choices. This reduces the complexity of management. Although players can customize the ships, including giving them names of your choice, the game comes with supplied ones include a variety that should suit many different circumstances.

Whichever vehicle is chosen, players will control it from a 1st person perspective and a series of controls. All ships skim over the surface of the planet and feature weapons. Most missions will involve destroying rogue robots enemies. Players will have to dock with buildings to refuel or move on to a different planet.</resource>

You are quite vulnerable to attack at first, but power ups come in the form of a Sega van which you have to dock with. The first time you dock you get double fire, the second time gives you a rocket, the third gives a rear force field and the fourth invulnerablility.

By destroying cars and bikes that appear on your way, you can collect A-F letters. Collecting A through to D allows you change into a sportscar which is less vulnerable to attack, but not as nimble. Collect all the letters in order to be able to transform into a high tech plane. This is the final stage of one of the five missions. Only the high tech plane can guide you to your destination in which your main target is hiding.

There is also time limit in which you have to complete the mission. It is advisable to transform into the high tech plane as fast as it is possible.

Picking up flags gives you bonus points with 10,000 points gaining you an extra life.</resource>

The game takes place towards the end of the movie: the Addams Family has been evicted from their home by a court order issued by a backstabbing attorney (there's one for the books), Tully Alford. Even worse, the other Addamses: Morticia, Pugsley, Wednesday, Granny and Lurch have gone missing.

As Gomez, you must tour the Addams mansion in search of your lost family, battling out mysterious monsters and evading traps, and eventually face your nemesis, Tully.

Artificial Intelligence took over Earth and the winner of the &amp;quot;Adrenalynn&amp;quot; championship may decide humanity's future. So naturally the player participates with the goal to win the major league (there are overall three with increasing difficulties). The game itself is a bit like indoor soccer with four athletes (armed with guns) and on a smaller playing field with bumpers. A match lasts 120 seconds and there are various power-ups to collect. Each player only takes control over a single athlete. The sportsmen show up on the screen as balls.</resource>

It was the first naval simulation to use real-time filled 3D graphics. Its style and mechanics are reminiscent of Epyx's Destroyer (1986).

ADS simulates the H.M.S. Onslaught, a British destroyer of the O-class fitted with three cannon turrets, four torpedo tubes on port and starboard respectively, and a sonar to detect and track submarines. In ADS, the Onslaught is not part of a flotilla.</resource>

Seven small 'toolkits' to build from include Sci/Fi, Spy, and Medieval setting templates, plus two complete games are included as a demonstration: Rivers of Light is based on Sumerian mythology and contains 140 rooms and Land of Aventuria consists of seven mini adventures with different settings, e.g. an adaption of Alice in Wonderland or a Nazi castle.</resource>

This involves bringing together your band of merry men, and killing the Sheriff and his guards. There are around 6 extra items you can find in the game, most of which aren't essential but make the game a lot easier. The whole interface is similar to Populous: you don't direct Robin directly but with icons which are placed around the screen.

The AI citizens of Sherwood go about their lives as normal, so it's another game that you can spend just watching and wandering through rather than trying to complete.

Controlling his(her) car in third-person 'behind the car' view, player should drive through the marked path in Sahara. When player loses his(her) way, he(she) may be in the sands alone and start to skid. In this situation he(she) may switch between 4x4 and 4x2 modes of the car. These modes have own opportunities and misses. The speed is limited to 87 in 4x4 mode and limited by car's parameters in 4x2 mode. But in 4x4 mode path marks may stop the car, while in 4x2 mode the car may knock the path parks off. Switching the gear, player may drive back and forth to avoid blocking of car either by path mark or by debris in the sand. Direction of the way is shown by compass as well as length of traversed path and volume of residuary fuel are displayed by indicators.

Other drivers are present on the way during day and night, therefore they should be left behind to win in the rally. There are five stages with different visible horizons:
1) Tunis - In Salah (5726 Km); 
2) Ouallene - Achegour (4353 Km); 
3) Achegour - Niamey (4587 Km); 
4) Ouagadougou - Bamako  (4438 Km); 
5) Bamako - Dakar (3622 Km).

So, you have to conquer the sands of Sahara, show good time on each stage, and to be the first at the finish.

The goal is simple: use your F-14 Tomcat and shoot as many enemies as you can. This aircraft has two weapons: lock-on missiles and Vulcan cannons (basically machine guns). In some versions there is an option to let the cannons shoot automatically all the time.

The game is viewed from behind the plane with you fighting wave after wave of enemy fighters. But at heart it offers the usual shooter mechanics, meaning you spend most of your time dodging and shooting. Sometimes you come across a friendly supply plane and if you dock with it you can replenish your missiles.</resource>

Out of the ashes comes a hero, Jonathan Rogers, better known as &amp;quot;Jungle Rogers&amp;quot;, the owner of the asphalt jungle. The only chance of survival is to reach the airdrop platform XV-238, located in the control base of the schizophrenic assassin professor McJerin, and to escape to outer colonies.

There is no easy way to do this. The game is a side-scrolling shoot 'em up, with thugs coming at you constantly, and a few moves to use on them. You must cross the dangerous streets of Manhattan, which have become over-run by feral thieves. Later you await the guardians of the scientific complex of McJerin.</resource>

The player's avatar has a nice spacesuit, as well as magnetic shoes. These are handy, as they allow the player to run not only on the floor, but also on the walls and the roof. An alternative to running is a jump, which let you drift (and turn) until you reach the other side of the screen. Your only gun is shooting some kind of laser, presented as a line, which is reflected from the walls.

There are four basic levels which has to be mastered, which means a given score has to be reached before the other levels open and finally Dick can be reached. The levels vary in the form of the walls, some are more circular, other more like a rectangle. The enemies are different in each level, and can attack with sheer size (Grok) or an amount of small enemies (Virus).

Four separate two-player levels can be chosen, which can be played as death-match. If no second player is around, the computer can control player two.</resource>

The result is a platform game across differently-themed levels, which are finished by either climbing to the top of the level or killing a boss. Bonus games and secret rooms have been included, and progression sometimes requires solving positional puzzles.

Alfred cannot fly, but he can use ramps to jump up and hit enemies with his bionic beak - this kills them, but any other contact will hurt Alfred. Watch out for spiked snails though. Other enemies include whales armed with guns, and stray bombs.

Besides the usual alien attack on a space station there is no background story. The player is cast as the only defender of the eight inhabitants and has to prevent them from being kidnapped by the aliens.

Each of the levels can be freely navigated (the ship's speed is automatically throttled when the invisible walls are reached) and the inhabitants stand around on pre-defined places. The aliens have various ship types with different behaviour patterns which either try to destroy the player's ship or collect the inhabitants and bring them into the aliens' invincible station. There they are transformed into especially powerful enemies (mutants). Besides the first-person view on environment, there are some instruments at the bottom of the screen, e.g. a list of present enemy types, a radar, speed, altitude or shield level. The latter represents the life energy and causes death when fully depleted. Additional lives are gained after earning enough points by shooting enemies. Besides dying, another way to lose the game is failing to keep at least one inhabitants alive.</resource>

The plot of the movie picks up directly after the end of Aliens. Ellen Ripley, the main character of the Alien series, is in cryo-sleep aboard the space ship Sulaco. Unfortunately, an alien or two has stowed away on the Sulaco, and wreaked havoc within the ship. Thus, it crash lands on the prison colony planet Fiorina 161. Ripley and the unarmed prisoners have to figure out a way to survive the aliens terrorizing the colony until help arrives.

The gameplay of the various Alien³ conversions varies from platform to platform. This version is a side-scrolling action game with large maze-like levels. In each level, you have to rescue all the trapped prisoners and then make your way to the exit, all while surviving multiple alien attacks.</resource>

Anyway, for those of you who are initiative-challenged will be pleased to know that the full instructions are coming up after this break.
Break.
Right, you play a nippy nameless young fellow who has to fend off hoards of alien scum-bag weakling no-brained slime-buckets using only your initiative. Oh, and a gun. By running around the spaceship (using the joystick) and avoiding anything which looks remotely harmless, you've got to free a set number of hostages from every level. These prisoners are encapsulated inside a lethal force-field which needs to be blasted away before you can run in and collect the stranded bods. Once you've managed to free all the prisoners in the level, make your way back to where you started from and you'll be whisked away to the next challenge.
Before you rush off and begin to blast things willy-nilly, it's worth mentioning that you cannot fire unless the joystick is pointing in one of the eight directions, so you either have to run towards the alien scumbag weakling no-brained slime-buckets whilst firing or centre the joystick, push FIRE and then move the joystick in whichever direction you wish to shoot.
There are simply loads of power-ups (revealed by destroying the funny looking shapes) to collect along the way, which vary from triple shot to super-hard death-inducing missiles which wipeout aliens with one hit. Brilliant! Also, there's a nifty invincibility token which renders you... yeah, you should know the routine by now.</resource>

After a planet was attacked by aliens and enslaved their inhabitants, the player takes the role of an escaped prisoner who tries clean up the mess.

While moving through the maze-like environments, the player shoots a lot of aliens and has to solve a few basic puzzles (usually switch puzzles or finding keys) in order to open up the way to proceed. Some of those are optional and open up bonus areas with power-ups (e.g. additional life-energy or extra weapons like grenades) and money. The latter can be also earned by killing enemies and is used between levels to buy the mentioned extras in a shop. The goal of each of the eight levels is to first free all hostages (a radar shows the general way) and then kill the end boss who always the same with different attacks. There are three control options to choose from which determine how the player character behaves while shooting, e.g. it allows to shoot while moving or while spinning on the spot.</resource>

Gameplay, though, was obviously inspired by the Atari arcade classic Gauntlet. The game tells a typical sci-fi story of an alien invasion on the space station ISRC-4. Two space marines, Johnson and Stone, are the only human beings left to clear the base of aliens.

Moving around an alien-infested complex in a top-down view, you must at all times keep an eye not only on your energy level, but also be conservative with ammunition. Though you will find new ammo cartridges strewn around the levels, they are consumed quickly by respawning aliens that may come crawling out of the floors and walls when you least expect it. On the floors, you will also find keys for passing through locked doors. Keys must also be used with care, or you may find yourself locked out of a room containing the remaining keys that you will need in order to complete the level. Other doors are one-way, and will electrocute you if you try to pass it in the other direction.</resource>

This release was in a similar vein, but set into a 3D context, making for the Amiga's first big Doom-style game. The 3D engine uses fairly small screen graphics, but these include full floors and ceilings with detailed shading, doors, vertical position variations, lifts and transporters. The CD version includes extra atmospheric sound, while fast processors and extra FastRAM are also supported.</resource>

The action offers the usual DOOM-inspired gameplay: shooting everything in sight by using the ten weapons with limited ammo and searching for key cards. The enemies are working together and trying to adjust their approach depending on which of the many weapons the player is armed with.

There is no music within the levels, just ambient sounds. A level editor is provided, which is especially useful for the two-player game.</resource>

    <resource id="ca32f53121aa9fc3c08880b5a87a6e9a6130af8f" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Alien Breed is a top-down science fiction shooter somewhat inspired by the movie Alien in terms of plot and atmosphere. Gameplay, though, was obviously inspired by the Atari arcade classic Gauntlet. The game tells a typical sci-fi story of an alien invasion on the space station ISRC-4. Two space marines, Johnson and Stone, are the only human beings left to clear the base of aliens.

Moving around an alien-infested complex in a top-down view, you must at all times keep an eye not only on your energy level, but also be conservative with ammunition. Though you will find new ammo cartridges strewn around the levels, they are consumed quickly by respawning aliens that may come crawling out of the floors and walls when you least expect it. On the floors, you will also find keys for passing through locked doors. Keys must also be used with care, or you may find yourself locked out of a room containing the remaining keys that you will need in order to complete the level. Other doors are one-way, and will electrocute you if you try to pass it in the other direction.</resource>

Earth has been attacked and overrun by the evil forces of Marania. All the planet's soldiers were taken as prisoners, all except one, Captain Cosmose who happens to be the player. Now it's up to him and his laser gun Sycho to save the world. Gameplay involves walking from left to right, shooting at the various enemies that appear in the player's path and jumping between platforms to find the right route and avoid falling into a pit. Enemies range from regular aliens, armoured ones, aliens riding strange vehicles to more abstract flying things. Sometimes potions appear from killed aliens, which can be either green or red. If the player touches a green potion he regains some health but if he touches a red one he loses some. When all out of health, one of three lives is lost.</resource>

Swearing a bit too loud about rescuing her, Slough Feg has heard you and turned you into an insect. With the help of magic from the Druid Lords though, you set off on your quest.

To help you, some minions leave behind either a power-up for your weapon or Zen, the currency of The Cave of Dreams. Zen can be spent in the shops that litter the landscape. Here you can buy health or extra weapons. Kai has three lives which are lost when his two energy dots turn from white, cycle through various colours before turning black.

Alien World is a scrolling shoot-em-up. Various levels scroll horizontally while others scroll vertically. The screen will only scroll when you move so far across the screen. You cannot re-trace your steps. As well as the main playing area you can also see your score, amount of Zen, Energy dots, lives and various weapons. The joystick moves Kai, but not touching the joystick lets gravity kick in. The fire button fires your weapon.</resource>

The Mobile bounces from platform to platform, making its way around the room to the doors that lead into other rooms. On the way, the player encounters many other creatures and vehicles, as well as surprises, such as rooms with reversed gravity.

There are two modes of play: Emotion and Action.

    In Action, players start in the central room, and work their way around with a time limit. Players gain time when going into a room they haven't been in before, and when crystal or cube power-ups are picked up. When time runs out, the Mobile explodes and the game ends.
    In Emotion, players can choose to start in any of the 12 regions into which the 256 rooms are grouped. The regions are arranged in the context of different areas of the human brain. While there is no timer, players also can't explore beyond the region that is chosen.</resource>

With scenery inspired by Ancient Greece, you have to fight hordes of undead and demons, with a boss at the end of each level until you meet the god Neff, who holds the girl captive.

The Altered Beast title refers to your shapeshifting abilities. In this platformer, you can collect spirit balls by defeating two-headed wolves, allowing you to mutate into different beasts such as a werewolf, a dragon, a tiger, a bear and others depending on the version. Each form, tied to a level, comes with special abilities such as flight and powerful attacks, easily superseding the basic set of punches and kicks in your human form.

The game can be played in single player mode, or in same-screen multiplayer co-op mode.</resource>

Barrett, an ordinary human being from the planet Earth, goes to a repair shop to fix his TV set. When he comes back for it, he accidentally picks up a wrong one. No big deal? Quite on the contrary. When the unsuspecting Mr. Barrett returns home and turns the TV on, he is sucked into a portal! One moment later he finds himself on the strange planet of Daltere. Naturally, this planet needs a savior: the evil alien Helmar has stolen an artifact known as the Jewel of Light, thus endangering the entire galaxy. Now our unlikely hero has to overcome various obstacles and to save the world.

Altered Destiny is a puzzle-solving adventure game. The interface is very similar to the one used in Les Manley games by the same company. The navigation can be done with the mouse (point-and-click), but the game still requires text input to issue commands to the hero and to interact with the world.</resource>

This game is primarily a platforming game in which Spider-Man fights against various enemies. Those can be stunned with Spider-Man's iconic web substance, but touching them or other hazards in the game world will decrease his heath. Another important part of the gameplay are puzzles, mostly with the goal to deactivate some of Mysterio's gimmicks, e.g. changed gravity, to clear the path. Spider-Man can can climb walls and shoot grappling hooks.</resource>

Initially the player creates a single protagonist with randomly assigned attributes and no class designation. During the course of the game, additional characters (up to six active party members) can be found in different cities and other locations and recruited. Some of these characters already belong to established classes and come with their own abilities. Guilds of various classes (fighter, paladin, ranger, mage, monk, and thief) can be visited, where the protagonist and his class-less companions (if any) can be promoted. Choice of classes affects attributes, character growth, imposes equipment restrictions, etc. When leveling up, characters can train in specific locations, increasing attributes of the player's choice.</resource>

The basic lay remains to control a bat which slides back and forth at the bottom of the screen. Stacks of coloured bricks are arranged in patterns above. The object is being to bounce a ball to hit the bricks to make them disappear. Some bricksâ€™ require multiple hits to destroy - visually indicated by dots shown on the face. Some special bricks are distinguished from others by unique icons, e.g. one with aâ€™ skullâ€™ will result in a loss of life if hit by the ball, or one with an â€˜xâ€™ mark will cause new bricks to spawn &amp; spread. 

At times bricks will yield colour-coded pickups which topple down and may be caught, resulting in a special power-up feature being given. A unique play facet presented here is that power-upsâ€™ are not activated automatically, but rather are reserved - The player may utilise the last power-up collected upon clicking the right mouse button, this remains true even if a ball is lost.</resource>

Each player selects two wrestlers from those on offer, and when the one in the ring is weakened he can go to the edge of the ring and tag his team-mate, who then enters the ring and allows the other to recover.

You can either play individual matches (for one or two players) or a full tournament, with three rounds of variable length. There is no joystick-waggling in the control system, with a variety of kicks, throws and punches on offer using simple joystick motions. Once the players are close together they grapple - this gives you a chance to lift and then piledrive your opponent.</resource>

The character starts with three lives and additional ones can be gained by reaching certain scores.

When holding a button or key pressed the controls include moving backwards and forwards, jump, duck, high punch and mid punch, front somersault and block. When that button or key is released the controls offer turning, high kick, mid kick, low kick, high back kick, jump kick, foot kick and back somersault. Fights are fast-paced and require a lot of hit and run tactics.</resource>

It is a real-time strategy game in nature, and most of the time is spent on the overhead map. Here players plan their strategy and set the goals and routes for their aircraft. There are various statistics which are affected by the happenings on the battle field, e.g. destroying factories lengthen the time the enemy can get new aircraft.

When a flight battle or bombing occurs, the game switches to a side-scrolling combat screen. Here players actively participate in the combat; during dog fights the goal is to destroy the enemy and bombings are a matter of releasing the bomb at the right time while avoiding flak fire.

    <resource id="a56f98678fa84fbda8282dc0f183085a7baa8632" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Antares is a classic role-playing game of the Bard's Tale variety set in a science-fiction scenario. After the radio contact with space explorers stopped, a second troop goes to look for them. Unfortunately on the way they receive a emergency call, get shot and have to land on the planet Kyrion. Now the troop has to explore the planet and find out more about what happened.

The party has six members (chosen from twelve pre-defined characters) with different statistics and abilities, e.g. fighting, cooking, PSI (the science-fiction variant of magic) or translating (needed to communicate with non-hostile species). The world and dungeons are explored through a first-person perspective and when meeting enemies, the fight plays out turn-based: the player tells the characters what to do and text informs of the results. Killing enemies reward experience points which in turn improve the abilities.

Each character has to eat and sleep. While too much hunger results in death, a sleeping character is in a kind of trance: he still walks around, but can't take any actions or fight. Besides sleeping, there is also medicine available to keep the spirits up: just like other parts of equipment, it can be bought in hidden shops with gold found at slain enemies. Each character can transport up to six items and a radar shows how dangerous the current area is. Dead party members can be resurrected at the landing module.</resource>

Those missiles are also available in the heat-seeking variety which are automatically used up first. Fuel is limited and is constantly drained every second, but it can be refilled by hovering over fuel depots which are regularly encountered during the levels. However, when shooting them with a missile instead, the depot releases additional missiles to collect. Of course it is also important to dodge enemies and their bullets because every hit causes the loss of a life. When that happens, a new helicopter with reset fuel and missiles appears with a brief invincibility period at the point of death. The game is lost when all lives are gone.</resource>

This alien is smart and is not easy to find, but humanity managed to track him down to an underwater location in the Caribbean. The game is divided into three levels with distinctive different gameplay mechanics.

The first level is a traditional, horizontally scrolling shooter. The protagonist, equipped with diving gear, has to make his way to the alleged position of the alien ship. Enemies are mutated underwater animals which are shot with the harpoon. There are also friendly creatures like dolphins and mermaids (their kiss gives an extra life) and military crates which contain additional gear. Air is limited and has to be refilled at certain parts of the level.

In level two, the player has to investigate an underwater maze. He needs to find and grab various items which are used at another place to proceed. This section is puzzle-oriented and the action concentrates on obstacles which need to be avoided and single enemies.

Level three is also a maze in which objects need to be found (a decoder and keys) which need to be brought to a final location. However, it is set on land (Atlantis, to be exact) and therefore air is no longer an issue. The fights take a &amp;quot;run and gun&amp;quot; approach where the player shoots a lot of aliens and dodges their attacks. In this section the game flips the screen when another room is entered.</resource>

This game saw Pond and friends competing in the underwater Olympics.



The events take the form of various mini-games, usually in the same vein as Hyper Sports, but with an aquatic theme and the humour seen in the James Pond series (e.g. The 100 Metre Splash). More unusual mini-games include Kipper Watching, which involves 'heading' incoming beach balls away from a troop of sleeping seals, and Gymnastics. Events can be played with up to 4 players.</resource>

The survivors have build eight underwater colonies - that's all what left from humanity. Unfortunately, the nuclear war was just the beginning. An alien race, the Spurcians, made advantage from this situation. So they've conquered Earth and have taken those eight cities. Now the only survivors are inside the freight vessel Genesite, which is in orbit. On a last attempt to free the underwater colonies, the pilot Josh Aldrin (you) is send back. Meanwhile, the Spurcians destroyed the freight vessel, making you the last human on Earth. So, you are now on revenge...

Your job is now to flight with your craft above the water surface. Destroying enemy alien crafts and energy generators. When you destroyed enough generators, the energy shield from the main pyramid fails, and you can attack the level guardian. Once he is destroyed, you use the tunnel, which connects the underwater colonies, to get to the next one. You will play all eight colonies. While in the tunnel, you have the chance to collect power-ups to regenerate your ships energy (health). Inside a level, you have to live with the energy you currently have. Oh, and by the way, you have, like in reality, only a single life.

    <resource id="c4a4bcb179cb69da7a07611519944981c53ebf9f" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">In Arabian Nights, you play Sinbad Jr., a gardener at the royal palace who loves to sneak a peek at the princess every now and again. One day, Sinbad looks up and sees a huge demon kidnapping the princess. He dashes to save the princess, only to be caught by the palace guards and thrown in the dungeon. 

There are nine levels in the game. In several levels, there are various gameplay elements which include flying on the magic carpet and racing against your opponent in a mine cart. You will also meet some characters, which if you give them an item they want, they will give you something in return.
 
In other levels, you have to do things yourself. For example, obtain a snake that will set a prisoner free, or using a blow torch to open some frozen doors.

Arabian Nights comes on two floppy disks, but a CD32 version is also available on 1 CD.

There's also a Survivor mode, which is similar to the early Pool arcade game, in that you're playing alone and have to clear the table without missing more than three times. Speed Pool involved clearing the table as quickly as you can - two minutes can be considered a good time.</resource>

There are four blocks of questions. Each block contains questions in six categories;

Art &amp; Literature, Science, Music, Film and Television, Sport, History &amp; Geography.

Icons representing these categories are displayed in a pyramid arrangement. The icons of available questions flash in sequence and the players must press FIRE at the correct time to select the icon of their choice. All questions are multiple choice with four answers, one correct &amp; three incorrect, being available.
Both question selection and answering are timed and must be completed in eight seconds.

Scoring is cash based. All players start with Â£1.00 and each player stakes 20p per attempt. If, by answering questions successfully, a player makes it to the top of the pyramid then they trigger a 'Cash Run' feature which can earn extra money - up to Â£5.00.</resource>

It is based on the principle of chess, with the addition of combat phases. Each piece is placed on the chessboard according to its range of movement and forms an army representing light or shadow. When one unit attempts to take another, both are transported to a combat arena to determine the winner. A unit can remain wounded even after winning its duel, which reduces its chances of victory in a future battle.  The game is won when all opposing units are destroyed or when a player has five power points.</resource>

Each side plays as an Adept - a powerful wizard with the ability to cast spells against other Adepts and his summonings - and must defeat the other side, either Chaos or Order, by attacking him/her with summoned Elementals or Demons. Each side can summon 4 unique elementals at a time or choose from 4 demons, common to both.

Gameplay is similar to the original, reminiscent of a chess-like board game, requiring strategy, but with arcade elements, especially when two adepts confront each other face-to-face. The board also shifts from time to time, making the strategy less predictable.</resource>

    <resource id="f44b11b48fa9973c276dd0c922244a5ee2445237" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">The original Breakout concept involves controlling a bat at the bottom of the screen and using it to catch and direct a ball so as to hit all the bricks which are arranged at the top of the screen. It was unpopular for over a decade, before Taito revived it with some new ideas in this arcade game.
The game's plot redefines the bat as a Vaus spaceship, the ball as an energy bolt, and the bricks form a mysterious wall stopping the ship from progressing to safety.
By the mid-80s, power-ups were popular in most types of arcade games, and Arkanoid features them. They are caught by positioning the bat below them as they fall (meaning that you risk missing the ball if you go for them at the wrong time). The power-ups include lasers (which are mounted to each side of the ship and allow you to shoot out the blocks), a catching device (so as to be able to fire the ball off at a different angle every time you hit it) and one that slows the bolt down.</resource>

Be aware that these decisions have consequences - the 16 nations all have feelings of importance and would not want to be sidelined.</resource>

It is the sequel to the Amiga / C64 platform game Arnie (1992). Unlike the previous title it has been developed in-house by Zeppelin

Fast reflexes and a lust for violence are required for success here. Your average muscleman shoots and bombs his way through four enemy-infested territories: Shut down a chemical plant by blowing up enough pipeline valves. Clear an airfield from enemy soldiers, tanks and helicopters. Climb from battleship to battleship in a hostile harbor. And finally, rescue as many prisoners as possible from a jungle POW camp.

Naturally, the levels are crawling with enemies: from simple infantry armed with rifles, mortars or rocket launchers to MG teams, missile batteries and tanks. Most of the opponents are stationary and stolidly fire in a single direction; however, foxholes spew out cannon-fodder at a constant rate. To destroy such nests or efficiently dispatch groups of soldiers, Arnie has a (limited) supply of grenades. Some deceased foes drop more powerful weapons as well as invaluable first aid kits and extra lives.</resource>

You will battle numerous horrible creatures such as spiders and bats with your axe and avoid deadly traps while attempting to gain access to Morgause's castle. You will also search for 6 runes, which contain spells, that you must find in order to free Nimue. Artura contains 4 maze-like levels that are so complicated that poster sized map of the levels is included with the game.</resource>

Much like the similar looking USSR at the time, the society is crumbling, and you are an upstart aiming to take over power for yourself â€¦.. erm, I mean, aiming to bring peace, harmony, prosperity and happiness. 

You start off in a small coastal province, and must progress by meeting people and negotiating to get them on your side â€“ sometimes the sword is mightier than the pen, sometimes not. You must ensure that the more militant locals are pacified, and that ethnic minorities are looked after.

While those sections are all strategic, there are also some vector-based combat sections. These ensure that brawns are required along with brains, and give the game some variety.</resource>

The game is in the platform style and you must jump and duck the various obstacles you encounter. The monsters you will meet include giant scorpions, beholders and fire elementals.

You will have to defeat Astaroth's 3 guardians of the soul along the way, firstly a sphinx, secondly a 3 headed hydra and finally a marlith demon. Once you have defeated the guardians you will have to face Astaroth herself in a battle of the minds using the powerups you have collected.</resource>

You kill them by firing blocks at them, which carry on moving until they hit a bad guy (in which case both are destroyed and you get some points) or another block (in which case it comes to a stop). The way the level layouts change as you play allows you to potentially box in some enemies, so you can deal with them gradually.

There are also exploding bad guys (drawn as Lemmings), so watch out for the warning as they prepare. Some blocks are icy, meaning that they can't be pushed, and they destroy any block that hits them. Collectible power ups include a short-term baddy-freeze and short-term invincibility. There's a co-operative 2-player mode, in which you can, unusually, harm your team-mate.

An extremely sophisticated editor was tucked away in the game, allowing you to not only design a maze and position the baddies (including regenerating ones, set to come in at any interval), but also change their speed and how frequently they fire hazards out.</resource>

It incorporates elements of role-playing, driving and action-based combat. The game is set in a futuristic version of USA, where gangs and vigilantes rule the wilderness, and people's only protection are armored cars with mounted weaponry. The player is cast in the role of an average person who must at first earn enough money to buy an own car, and then perform courier missions throughout the country.

The game's progression is fairly open-ended: the player is free to visit different cities, explore highways, participate in car Arena battles to earn money, take on gangsters in the wilderness, salvage car parts, etc. A few courier missions must be completed in order to advance the story. The player can construct and customize vehicles using guns, mine-layers, smokescreens, oil slicks, rockets and other accessories, choosing between various body and chassis types for the car. The entire game is viewed from a top-down perspective.</resource>

You have been chosen to be the central link of the support command which will try to give a solution for it. But don't worry, you have been educated and trained in the Golden Ring space station, the hardest survival school of the galactic confederation.

Besides, your ship is equipped with the ultimate devices which will allow you to travel safely by the well-known universe. The Combat Mode, where you can activate a panel with a system to locate and to destroy your enemies and the Control System via Menus, both make La Aventura Espacial a new concept in the graphic-conversational adventure.

First of all, your mission is to find your companions, whom are distributed by all the universe, and together with them you must arrive to the central base of the Dark Threat. There, you will have to deal one on one with the computer. It's not an easy task, but you are the last hope of the humanity. All the galaxy has its destiny in your hands.</resource>

It gathered a cult following from the elite programmers who knew how to connect to the data bank where it was located, and like all cults, it had its first &amp;quot;martyrs&amp;quot;; several important programmers were fired after becoming &amp;quot;addicted&amp;quot; to it, found playing it late at night while understood to be working overtime instead.

In the United States it was the base that inspired Scott Adams to begin with his famous adventures. In Great Britain, Peter Austin, founder of Level 9, the most prestigious English adventure game company, confessed to be impelled by it from his beginnings as a game designer (one of his first adventures was a version of the Original Adventure). In Spain, there was a similar story, since the first Spanish company dedicated exclusively to text adventures (Aventuras AD), made its reputation based on a game curiously called &amp;quot;La Aventura Original&amp;quot; (yes, based on the legendary one), the fruit of 8 months of investigation and work.

This version, aside from being in Spanish, has with several points worth mentioning, such as having more than 100 detailed locations with graphical illustrations; a special routine of exit descriptions (indispensable for guiding the adventurer through this complex world); and the possibility of using accents, &amp;quot;ÃƒÂ±&amp;quot;'s and opening interrogation and exclamation signs. As well, every object of your inventory is described in text and graphic form. The characters also use the PSI system, so they are not mere objects with human names, but will listen to you and respond -- but most importantly, will act according to how you treat them.</resource>

It supports two players simultaneously, developed and published by Bignonia as a shareware, which was released in 1993.

You have to steer your character through seven absolutely different levels. In every level new deadly perils lurk for the hero. The first is probably the most famous level. Left and right are some not exactly friendly meaning Aztecs, which welcome you with spears. You either have to duck under the spear or jump over it (depending on the height the spear is coming at). If you get hit you have to start again. In the later levels you have to avoid stones, poisonous scorpions and snakes and get over a bridge.</resource>

Combat occurs randomly and utilizes a real-time system: the player must prepare for the battle within a limited amount of time, after which the combatants exchange blows. The protagonist is able to side-step and dodge the attacks. Other features include the ability to program the B.O.B. (organic computer implanted on your arm), and RPG-style character development based on various stats.</resource>

The game itself is a mixture between graphics adventure, space combat simulator and strategy game.

The game is not unlike other platform games of the era. Though it's unique in that you can climb walls and swing on rope with your teeth and your only method of attack is head butting enemies - straight forward or dive bomb style. The game starts off with simplistic point A to point B style, but focuses more on exploration in the later stages, which include finding hidden bonus areas.

The game is also known for its trademark gameplay mechanism of 'spin attack', where Bonk floats through the air if you have the turbo button on. This can be used to float around the level and reach areas for extra/hidden items, but also as a method of attack as well. The game starts you off with 3 hearts, but allows you to increase this number when you find special heart container items, allowing Bonk to take a number of hits before dying.

A variety of bonus stages can be found throughout the game, which provide bonus points upon completion and thus resulting in accumulating extra lives. Enemies themselves can be 'milked' for points in that you can keep 'bonking' their dead bodies and not letting them hit the ground. Spin attack is another method for doing this.</resource>

There's a computer opponent, but the scoring isn't affected by whether you beat him just so long as you qualify. There is a two-player mode. A unique feature at the time is the action replay, which can be viewed in slow motion.

Baby Jo in: &amp;quot;Going Home&amp;quot; is a side-scrolling platform game. Jo can pick up rattles which can be tossed at enemies (such as bees, lawnmowers or spiders). Apart from watching out for the baby's dropping health (represented as an increasingly tearful face), the baby's diaper gets wetter over time and the thirst increases, too. If the diaper becomes too wet or the baby becomes too thirsty, the player immediately loses a life, so collecting fresh bottles and diapers is important.</resource>

Marty McFly and Doc Brown have traveled back through time to the year 1885 - and they're soon deep in trouble when they face &amp;quot;Mad Dog&amp;quot; Tannen's gang and have to find a way to return to the present. This game takes four scenes from the Hollywood movie Back to the Future III and turns them into arcade sequences:

1. Buckboard Chase: Doc Brown goes horseback in an attempt to save Hill Valley's lovely school teacher Clara. This game of quick ducking, jumping and shooting alternates between a side-scrolling and a top-down perspective.

2. Shooting Gallery: The name says it all. A classic game of aim-and-shoot, spiced up by hidden extras and bonus targets.

3. Pie Throwing: Meet the Mad Dog gang. They have guns, and you have... cream pies. It's an isometric version of the shooting gallery, only with ammo. And the targets shoot back.

4. The Train: Basically a side-scrolling beat-em-up on train wagons with some ducking and jumping. Get rid of the mechanics and collect speed logs to push the engine to a magic 88 mph.

The game takes place on a seemingly endless flat landscape, littered with obstacles in the form of some pseudo 3D spikes protruding from the ground. Armadas of hostile UFOs shoot fire balls at you from every direction. Your aiming reticle is in the centre of the display, and is surrounded by circular radar, which is formed by a series of small white dots, within this are numerous red dots which represent the UFO enemies. You are dealt an initial five lives, and you score points for each UFO destroyed. The game features environmental effects, such as day time turning to night, and vice versa.</resource>

You and your (optional) companion have the task to clear those worlds from hostile alien insectoids.

&amp;quot;Bad Company&amp;quot; is played in a pseudo-3D view (third person) that very much resembles that of Space Harrier games.
Before you start to play you'll have to choose one of the eight offered troopers as your player character. This decision will influence gameplay later on, e.g. you won't be able to carry a specific weapon or your character is especially fast, and so on. When it comes to the action you'll be confronted with several different alien types including &amp;quot;level bosses&amp;quot;.You battle these foes by using one of the four available weapon systems (equipment can be changed in the course of the game). You have full movement control over your character, meaning the screen isn't auto-scrolling like in comparable games. You can also take cover behind certain obstacles or choose to blow them up.

The game extends over four levels (the four Nu-Worlds).

    <resource id="843e62161de285228b6203162b85eab4c9abe961" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">The gameplay of Bad Dudes is roughly similar to the 1985 Konami side-scrolling arcade game Rush'n Attack and the 1984 side-scrolling beat-'em-up Kung Fu Master, but allows up to two players to play at once. Player One controls the character named &amp;quot;Blade&amp;quot; wearing white pants and Player Two controls the character named &amp;quot;Striker&amp;quot; wearing green pants. Players start with the ability to do basic punches, kicks and jumps. Some moves are special like spinning kicks and the ability to charge themselves up with &amp;quot;inner energy&amp;quot; (Qi) by holding the punch button to throw a powerful long-range attack that hits all opponents in front of the player. Players will also come across several power-ups; some are weapons like knives and nunchakus and some recharge a player's health, and yet others add a few seconds to the remaining time.[7]



The various types of enemies encountered in the game have their own means of attack. The basic blue-colored ninja directly charge the player, while some leap with their swords, or throw shuriken and makibishi; there are also acrobatic kunoichi female ninja, attack dogs, and even people who are on fire. The enemies may be beaten down or avoided. Most enemies can be beaten with only a single hit of any kind, and multiple enemies can be defeated with one hit if they are standing close together.



At the end of each level, one of the &amp;quot;super warrior&amp;quot; bosses will appear which needs to be defeated to progress to the next level. The first of them is Karnov, who cameos from the Data East game of the same name;[8] the background music during the fight with him is similar to the main theme in Karnov as well.[note 1] Each boss has their own special attacks: Karnov, for example, can breathe fire at the player. At the successful completion of each level, the dude(s) strike a &amp;quot;bad&amp;quot; pose and proclaim, &amp;quot;I'm bad!&amp;quot;. The shout, and the game's American wordmark logo are both similar to the Michael Jackson song &amp;quot;Bad&amp;quot; released the previous year. In the Japanese version of the game, this quote was originally a battle cry.</resource>

Two human players can take part, but only the winner continues without using up credits, so you will only see the early races in two-player mode. 

You are armed with guns, which can be used to slow opposing cars. During the races spanners can be collected, which are then cashed in for upgraded turbos, improved weaponry and engine upgrades. Hazards on the later tracks include ramps, bridges, buildings collapsing onto the track and barriers which open and close in a random sequence.

The player takes the role of Pete, walks through the side-scrolling levels and shoots everything that moves. This is to be taken literally because the enemies are not restricted to the usual bandits; there are also other people like old ladies which try to land a hit. To be fair, these are mostly encountered when Pete uncalled enters their houses by using the so-called &amp;quot;Strip-A-Motion&amp;quot; feature. This basically means that Pete can walk &amp;quot;inside&amp;quot; the screen to enter houses or walk behind obstacles.

To shoot the enemies, Pete needs to draw his gun, aim and shoot - for the player these are three different actions. He can't walk when the gun is drawn so it needs to be holstered, too. The amount of bullets (replenishment can be found in houses or at dead enemies) and health is limited. The latter is represented by a heart full of red liquid which drains when Pete is hit by bullets or touches enemies.</resource>

The basic gameplay is very similar to Virgin's Spot license. Your aim is to take control of the largest area of the board, which is done by moving your pieces so as for them to be next to pieces of another colour, which will then become your colour. There are three types of move Ã¢â‚¬â€œ short moves which also see you retain the square you were in, jumps in which you lose the previous square, and moves using the teleporting device to move a larger distance. There are over 100 levels, which needn't be played in sequence. The board layouts feature gaps in, which must be incorporated into your strategy, to ensure that you don't leave a space next to a large number of your pieces, which would allow an opponent to swallow them up.</resource>

To become a member of the Warrior Guild, you must complete 25 levels of Ball Raider in the year 2488. Ball Raider is a Breakout variant where you have to hit a ball with a bat at the bottom of the screen towards bricks at the top of the screen. Your bat catches the ball each time it hits it so you can move your bat elsewhere and press fire to send it towards the bricks again. Once you clear all the bricks then it's onto the next level.</resource>

Game is developed by The Incredible Trio and published by US Action, which was released in Europe in 1988.

Use your bat to deflect the ball into the coloured bricks. Some bricks hide bonuses, which yield benefits such as an enlarged bat, laser firing ability, or multiplying the number of balls in play. You have 3 lives at the start of the game and you will find they don't last very long, unless your reflexes serve you well.</resource>

To do this, you will control an arrow that defines a direction, and pressing the fire key will launch a ball from this arrow in the direction the arrow points to; by launching balls at correct angles, you will manipulate the main ball and control the way it moves. Ballistix also keeps certain physics laws (namely gravity and friction), and will present you with varying obstacles in either one or two player mode.

Set in 12th Century China, Bandit Kings recreates a famous Chinese folk legend wherein 108 exiled heroes take up arms against the oppressive government with the twin goals of ousting the tyrannical Gao Qiu and restoring stability to the Empire.

KOEI takes war-gaming to new heights with super graphics and animation, highly realistic detail, and great sound, combined with a sophisticated, easy-to-use gaming system. One to seven players collaborate in playing out four separate scenarios with a cast of 255 characters - a different game every time you play.</resource>

There are lots of big, brash enemy vehicles to take on, plus individual soldiers (these often lie in a pool of blood afterwards, a gruesome sight making full use of AGA graphics) and civilians. Many of the enemies have good hiding places and can emerge surprisingly, Commando-style.

There are four large levels, which also scroll a small amount horizontally, the idea being that you can evade some opposition. There's a special loop-the-loop type feature available, which can double as an attack or an evasive move.

From the lands to the north, a hero is sent to help the city and free the princess. He is Gorth, the strongest of the barbarian warriors. With his sword in hand, he has to beat eight of Drax's best warriors and at last the magician himself. He will fight them in the woods, on the mountaintop, in the dungeon... finally reaching Drax's palace itself.

This is essentially a one- or two-player fighting game where you control a big barbarian and fight another player or a computer AI. There are several kinds of hits, and some hits take off half a point while others take off a whole point. Each player has six of these &amp;quot;power points&amp;quot;. They also have a special hard to perform &amp;quot;death sword&amp;quot; which decapitates your opponent, killing him with one fell swoop.</resource>

The game was released for the Amiga, Apple II (64k), Commodore 64 and DOS.

Skara Brae is in ruins. Someone - or some thing - has sealed the city's fate with an evil so vast, so unspeakable, that a host of Paladins and an army of Archmages are outmatched. Hard times call for subtlety. Smaller is better. Sneakier is better. What the world needs now is a thief. The Thief of Fate.</resource>

It was also one of the first of Coktel's games to use FMV technology in cut-scenes.

The gameplay is a mix of science fiction, cyberpunk and comedy elements. It takes place in the near future when an alien race named Bargon conquered the Earth and enslaved its people. You take a role of the young programmer who decides to put an end to the cruel aliens. You'll travel through 20 or so locations. Each one consists of 1 to 3 screens, similar to other Coktel games.

Along your travels, you'll face dangerous creatures and some strange alien technology. There are some occasions when you can die (though the option to replay the level is always available), plus the game also features several arcade sequences.

He also has to collect enough &amp;quot;proof&amp;quot; of the aliens existence (brown coins left behind when they are jumped on), so his family members will help him when he meets a boss (characters such as Nelson and Sideshow Bob).

The last player to avoid the sticky out bits of the building and successfully open their parachute before becoming pavement art wins the round.

To defeat the Penguin, Batman must make his way through a number of levels, usually beating up henchmen from the Red Triangle Circus Gang with punches and kicks. There are also some special weapons, which must be collected and have limited ammunition: these include Batarangs, throwing disks or a Batrope. Some special enemies can only be defeated by applying the correct weapon.

Some levels give more weight to platforming than fighting, such as a rooftop chase with Catwoman or navigating the sewers while searching for the Penguin's lair.</resource>

It was released in 1989 for the Amiga, Amstrad CPC, Apple II, Atari ST, Commodore 64, MS-DOS, ZX Spectrum.

The game consists of five stages based on events from the movie. Each stage has a time limit and a health gauge (represented by Batman's face turning into the Joker's), with Batman losing a life if he runs out of either. The first stage sees players controlling Batman as he navigates the Axis Chemical Plant to confront Jack Napier, leading to the incident in which he becomes The Joker. In this level, the game features side-scrolling gameplay, in which Batman can use his Batarangs to defeat enemies or and his grapple gun to reach higher platforms and swing across gaps. In the second level, Batman rides in his Batmobile where he must dodge traffic and use a grapple to swing around corners to avoid running into the police. The third level is a puzzle section in which Batman must identify various components for Smilex, the deadly chemical Joker has put into the market. The fourth level takes place during Joker's parade, in which Batman must use the Batwing to cut away balloons filled with poisonous gas without hitting the balloons themselves. Finally, the fifth level, which reprises the gameplay of the first level, sees Batman make his way to the top of Gotham Cathedral to finally confront Joker.</resource>

Calumn is equipped with an axe that he can throw at enemies or he can choose to punch them in a melee fight. For smaller enemies such as the crawling slugs a kick is needed. By destroying slugs it's possible to obtain different tokens. Red ones re-energizes, blue ones gives a power up, green ones give invulnerability and yellow ones give extra lives.

There is a different animation for each permutation, depending on which pieces are capturing or being captured. You can also play in 2D without animation. 

The game's opening library includes 30,000 different moves, ensuring a variety of games will unfold across the 10 skill levels. 

Multi-player support can be extended to modem and/or serial port play.

    <resource id="b86304382583ed61d20197aeac103664cd1accad" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">An early squad based combat strategy game set in a medieval style fantasy world.

The player decides which race they want to play (Human, Orc, Dwarf or Elf) each with their own strengths and weaknesses. It is then a matter of clearing out areas of opponents and finding items to enhance your character's and companions abilities. 

There are many traps to avoid and death is a constant in what most people would find a very tough game. 

The nearest game to compare it to would be Rage Of Mages, though that has more of an RPG/RTT (real-time tactics) focus as opposed to &amp;quot;squad action&amp;quot;, but it does bear aesthetic similarities and a squad based fantasy fighting theme.

Gameplay for leader is action-oriented, with a menu that allows to Parley/Travel/Rally Troops, change formations or use items. The leader attacks with Melee and Projectile buttons. Some classes are more reliant on teammates than others. &amp;quot;Parley&amp;quot; allows you to buy (but not sell) items, or buy a Safe Pass (skip the area)</resource>

These are located at opposite ends of the playing area, so you can pursue them in either order. Needless to say, the terrorists have plenty of forces out to prevent you getting too far.

Unusually, the game features both a helicopter and a tank - you choose either from the base, and can fly/drive back there to change. The best strategy is to use the helicopter to shoot out air-based enemies and repair the various bridges, then return for the tank. You get 4000 seconds in which to complete all this, and losing a life costs you 500 of these.

In the 3lst century five states are continually fighting for supremacy. As 18-year-old Jason Youngblood, you're still at school but instead of learning quadratic equation you're being trained how to be a Mech warrior, defending the Lyran Commonwealth. Mechs are massive military robots, armed to the teeth with lasers and machine guns, and piloted by humans

Hours of play need to be put in to get anywhere in Battletech, but the experience is so uneventful, only a dedicated reviewer or RPG fan could be bothered to persevere. The only pleasure lies in building up Jason's skills and later recruiting friends. Instead of being explosive, combat is dull, merely consisting of two or more Mechs firing laser after laser at each other. The shots don't even appear on the main screen. Instead, a small window displays messages and sometimes shows an animated Mech firing a laser. This is both confusing and distinctly unexciting.</resource>

As with all such games you have some enemies to foil and extra weaponry such as rockets, stun bolters and to pick up. Game mechanics are Wolfenstein 3D-influenced, and the graphics smooth and, surprisingly, fast, though they do not vary much except in colour tint. Sound effects consist of the odd gun shot and scream and the music is designed to be atmospherically suited. Four different control systems are offered.</resource>

When Robert Foster's Gap-dwelling tribe is killed by soldiers from Union City who capture him, everything changes for him. After a narrow escape from the helicopter bringing him there as it inexplicably crashes, Robert and his droid Joey must search the decaying city, attempting to befriend both the snobby rich and the frustrated poor as the two attempt to get out of the city, but in the middle of everything they uncover the dark truth about LINC, the bizarre computer which makes the city tick.

Using the then revolutionary Virtual Theatre engine, BASS' characters can move freely independent of the player, allowing the game world to be much more dynamic than anything seen before (other than Virtual Theatre's debut game, the less popular Lure of the Temptress). Otherwise, the engine provides tried and true point-and-click adventure gameplay.

The iPhone version introduces a touch-based interface, new animated movies by Dave Gibbons, a context-sensitive hint system and a remastered audio track.

These Merry Men each have their own potential skill once rescued, so releasing them in the right order is often essential for completing a level. Some Merry Men have grey suits - this marks them out as joyless and awkward characters which must be guided through a coloring machine.

The Miniation people have loaded the 60 levels with various nasties, ranging from slugs (slow, but must be jumped), Rock Men (those with sharp backs are more dangerous, but both are quite nippy), spiked teeth emerging from manholes, and so on. A large map is provided, and at any point you can pause the game and scroll around the map, which makes the forward planning easier.

    <resource id="897c4764bcc5303a413a0aec34a5c8b0b36fc9c0" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Betrayal is a Strategy game, developed and published by Rainbird, which was released in Europe in 1991.

The West Marches is ruled by a duopoly. The King and Bishop each has a court filled by courtiers presented by the knights of the land - you are one of them. Now, courtiers hold great influence as all matters of State are put to a vote in the respective Courts. If, by some chance or design, one of the knights could have more courtiers in each Court than any other then that knight would gain a majority. A chance to seize power and depose both Bishop and King would then present itself, replacing them with a suitable puppet ruler. If both Courts are so ruled then that knight is declared the winner. This is your task.

In Betrayal, four knights battle it out: managing estates, collecting taxes, creating armies, declaring war on a regular basis, spying and other noble acts. After a difficulty level has been decided upon in addition to other game options, you must travel to different villages. Villages supply taxes, wheat (the harvest of which you must personally initiate), pottery to sell and militias (for defense and for your army). A self-sufficient village is your aim, otherwise you'll have to finance it out of your own pocket. You'll also have to watch out for your popularity which, if it falls below a specified level, will result in rebellion.

At Court you must have at least 13 courtiers to overthrow the King or Bishop. To gain courtiers you must pay regular taxes, assassinate other courtiers, accuse them of treason and so on.
When traveling you will see your knight on horseback, traversing the countryside between villages. During this time he can find cash lying around on the floor and be mugged by... er, muggers. Combat is a simple arcade beat-'em-up viewed side-on.
Actually it is in the combat area that the whole game falls down. Here we have a game which promotes quite a bit of depth in its gameplay. Intrigue, assassinations, treason, economics etc, all combine to make a promising game. Then the combat comes along and spoils it. The combat is far too simplistic and lacking in any skill or judgement to be of any use to anybody. It reduces the game to a lottery. Frustrating, as combat is an important area of the game. What a shame.</resource>

You control a spaceship at the bottom of the screen facing upwards, firing at arrangements of aliens. You can move up and down as well as left and right as you shoot them. At set intervals an alien will emerge from the main pack and sweep down towards you.

Other levels feature Asteroids which split when shot, or a single Ã¢â‚¬ËœbossÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ alien. Aliens with green eyeballs release power-ups, such as improved weapons, shields and bombs. You have a single life with which to survive the carnage. You get points for surviving as well as scoring, so slow but cautious play is more rewarding.</resource>

First Axel Foley visits a warehouse to shoot out some bad guys in a Green Beret-influenced sequence.

The second level (first on the C64 version) involves driving after 3 lorries full of weapons, and shooting them out one by one, Chase HQ-style. Avoid contact and stay on the road to complete this. Next you must cross the grounds of a mansion, shooting anyone who gets in your way.

The final section is set within the mansion, and is first-person 3D, although with few movement angles and only one enemy on screen at a time.

One day he went out of his cave and saw a pterodactyl flying around. &amp;quot;That will be my dinner&amp;quot;, - thought Big Nose, took out his trusty club and ran after the winged reptile. Naturally, his quest for nutrition became much longer and more dangerous than he had ever imagined...

In this platform action game, you guide Big Nose through prehistoric levels, fighting prehistoric animals of various kinds. Big Nose starts out with his club, but will gain other, more powerful weapons. During your quest you can collect bones, which are the currency of the game. There are shops in which you can buy weapons and various spells that you'll be able to cast.

Take part in the gruelling Dakar rally, driving high speed through a variety of landscapes, from countryside to desert. Your car has 2 gears. You will have to beat the clock on each of the six stages, and run high enough up the racing order, to qualify for the next stage. When you use a continue, the time is reset but your position is not, making it relatively easy to complete a stage after coming close with one credit.

An Amiga indie classic. This game came in two version - Biplane Duel (AKA Bip) was the initial 2-player only version, and later Salmon-Pink Max (AKA Biplanes) which added AI players.

Not being an Amiga owner myself I missed out on this game, but it appears to be well remembered in the Amiga community due to appearances on various magazine cover disks.

This game is a nicely presented spin on the classic Biplane style game - two planes, a hut in the middle you must avoid on take off, some clouds to hide in and a balloon to avoid / shoot. After a quick play of the 2 player version all I can say is - this AI is very very hard to beat!</resource>

The player is required to select one side 'A' or 'B' in the conflict, and keep the save game for each pilot on a separate floppy.
Each pilot you can fly different missions and aircraft, but only those from your own side.

The player character flies from three land bases and two aircraft carriers on each side, and these bases can be damaged in several ways by enemy action, making them unavailable until repaired and reducing the available aircraft in the campaign.
Mission types are:
air intercept
air superiority
long range bombing
bomber escort
close support and ground attack
border or sea patrol
reconnaissance
troop drop
supply drop
stealth bombing
stealth reconnaissance
test pilot
An autopilot mode is available for longer cruises, if the enemies are far off. The 'test pilot' mission involves flying the X-15/X-29 and is not a part of the campaign.</resource>

Okay, so it is not as deep as Dungeon Master, but it has got the walking around a 3D maze bit Ã¢â‚¬â€œ with monsters too! The gameplay is pretty straightforward and involves getting from one end of a maze to the other, collecting cash and buying weapons along the way. Should you happen to meet a slimy green alien, you can splatter him across the walls with your current weapon which could be anything from a knife to a rocket launcher.

You do not get the fully animated 3D texture maps of games like Legend of Kyrandia, but you can still keep track of the flick-screen 3D graphics with the help of the map. Nowhere near commercial standard, but not bad for PD.</resource>

And it's one of those first-person perspective role-playing fighting fantasy things as well -things just could get any better really, could they? There is of course the usual plot to draw you into the game, but really all you need to know is that it is your task to wander around each level, clearing it of nasty alien type things, and then moving on to the next world. Simple, yet effective.

The control system works nicely and the rest of the icons are nicely laid out and easy to use. It's also easy to get hold of and use objects and the game breaks you in very nicely indeed - the first few levels are small but you get a few levels in and things really start to heal up.

A dark and atmospheric first-person seek and destroy adventure that should appeal to everyone. If you don't like this, you must be dead.</resource>

The fun about this game is the fact that you see new things and have to try to suss out what they do. Objective of the game is pretty simple really.... Just kick the devils butt once and for all. Keep an eye out for the devils advocates (small dumply dudes in a cloak) as the can give you advice on how to overthrow their master (Not the most popular of bosses). You can talk to any creature that you are standing next to by clicking the TALK button. While talking with aliens you can buy and sell items or just get the latest gossip from the pits of hell.

The whole Black Dawn saga is wonderful, very deep, with the dark atmosphere and with hundreds of weapons and items. Hellbound offers bigger main game window than it prequels, but your character settings options are more limited.</resource>

This time you're flying a chunky black bomber thing, and the major difference between this and every other vertically-scrolling shoot-'em-up is that your plane carries bombs instead of guns. You can buy all the usual power-ups from shops scattered around the landscape, but you have to choose quickly as you can still be shot and damaged while your plane sits on the runway conveniently placed outside the shop. Which is a bloody stupid idea if you ask me.

Graphically the game is very pretty, but soundwise it's a complete nightmare, with a choice given at the start between grating sound effects reminiscent of a Spectrum game loading, unlistenably awful music, or blissful complete silence. As for gameplay, well, no there isn't any.

Black Hornet was obviously written by someone with no grasp of the mechanics of what makes a good shoot-'em-up, and the endlessly repetitive nature of the enemy landscape and attacks will very probably send you to sleep before you get anywhere near the end of the first level. If you do manage that, you'll find yourself in a second level which is almost identical to the first one only green.</resource>

As usual, this game takes place after a terrible nuclear war, with you playing as the son of a lost freedom fighter. 

The freedom fighters try to recapture the remaining cities from the mercenaries acting on behalf of the underground people who instigated the war in the first place. To do this, you must travel from city to city on the open roads, arriving within a given time frame. This is difficult due to the crowded roads, but luckily you can blow up most other vehicles with your gun. As the game progresses, enemy vehicles become harder, requiring more shots to be taken out. Luckily, your bike may be upgraded in the shop between levels.

Black Viper has a certain arcade-ish look to its graphics, a jukebox for choosing soundtracks, and comes in both OCS and AGA versions.</resource>

    <resource id="fbbd73069a250066fcedb4efe5d05be73e479271" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">This 3D puzzle game stars an amorphous blue creature, and presents you with a top-viewed world in which the character is closer to you when it's near the top of the level. A number of blocks are suspended in space, and you bounce around these trying to reach the exit, having first completed the level's objectives. These include painting certain blocks à la Q*Bert, collecting objects and rescuing other blobs by guiding them to the exit. 

Additional types of block includes ones which shoot at you, cracked tiles which don't last long, sticky tiles you can't get much leverage from, and switches to make other blocks become visible or accessible. The 3D is an integral aspect of the game, with falling off ledges into oblivion causing the loss of a life.

Blobz steals its gameplay style directly from Lemmings, replacing the suicidal rodents with green nondescript things decked out with tiny eyes.

While Lemmings' motivation for suicide is biological, blobs just don't know any better. If they walk into spikes or water they die, but there's no stopping them. A walking they will go, straight into trouble. The puzzles themselves are satisfying, if frustrating and they have been well thought out using the various 'skills' which you can assign each Blob. Smooth horizontal scrolling and the neat moving water effects and special touches are very nice. While the platforms themselves might look basic, there is a good reason for this: a level designer has been included so you can make as many as you like, and it's simple to use. The game is based on six worlds each mapped out like a maze and there are 60 levels in total.

The amount of levels and the increasing difficulty means that this is not a fast game to finish. Add the possibility of infinite custom levels and you have a lot of game. A well recommended download.</resource>

The player has 4 missions to take on, in each case trying to kill baddies for the money they have, which can be spent in the shop rooms to upgrade their craft. Energy is depleted by contact with enemies and the walls, although there are some baddies who simply hover on your ship and steal, rather than physically doing damage.

The game is a shoot 'em up which scrolls both horizontally and vertically, while being viewed from an R-Type style sideways perspective. Navigating the levels sometimes requires the player to duck through gaps in scenery.

Ransom Stark became stricken with Hopkins-Brie Ontology Syndrome whilst working at TransTechnicals, due to his forced extended exposure to Cyberspace while he worked there. As soon as he was diagnosed he was dismissed from TransTech and found himself homeless and hopeless. Thankfully an ingenious woman, with a personal vendetta against TransTech, named Deirdre Tackett saved his life by inserting a prototype brain implant of her own design and this restoring his grip on reality.

Over the following year Ransom became known as a reliable freelance until one day he got a job worth much more than he bargained for! His employers turned out to be vampires and as part of his 'payment', Ransom was turned into a follower of the evil head-vampire, Abraham Van Helsing -- except his brain implant kicked in allowing him to keep temporary control of his humanity.

Now Ransom must put a stop to Van Helsing's plans to take over Manhattan and control Cyberspace and hopefully save himself from being a vampire before its too late!

The player takes the role of certain person who is proposed to play this board game with an android. If the player wins, more of the exposed picture of the opponent is displayed. There are ten stages to complete.

In the game there is an 8x8 board. Each space in the board contains a point value. The object of the game is to earn as many points as possible by moving a marker to a non empty space to collect how ever many points are in that space. The first player is only able to move the marker horizontally, and the second player can only move the marker vertically. The board contains both negative and positive point values, so ideally you want to take a high, positive point value and force your opponent to take a negative value. The game ends when no more moves are possible, and the player with the most points wins.</resource>

Unfortunately the flight dynamics were almost non existent

Overall, a fun game for flight sim beginners who aren't too concerned with realism in their games-- definitely not for ace pilots.</resource>

The game allows split screen gaming for two players, cooperatively or competitively, with multiple 3D camera angle features. Missions involve shooting down enemy planes, while others focus on specific targets. The game includes a very unique feature for those who chose to use it: the ability to convert the dogfights to turn-based battles fought on a hexagonal map but still maintaining the 3D view in a frozen window</resource>

The main character is Bobo - controlled by you - he is an inmate and has been sentenced for 17 years.
In this game inmate Bobo must do many chores, such as peeling potatoes, ladling soup to his fellow prisoners, helping his fellow prisoners to escape, jumping electric wires and singing lullabies to his snoring cell mates.

Besides playing all events it is possible to select and play just one event.
Up to six player can play this game by entering their names. They play alternating not simultaneously

Each event can be played by joystick or keyboard. The specific moves you have to make vary from event to event but it come basically down to moving the joystick or keyboard keys fast from left to right. To pick things up you have to move the joystick downwards (keyboard arrow key down). Tossing things is done by moving the joystick up (when using the keyboard you have to press cursor key up).

Below you 'll find a brief description of each event:

Bobo has a job in the prisons canteen. He must serve soup to the other inmates and keep their soup plates full. To do this Bobo must move around the tables. When his supply of soup is empty he must refill it at the top of the screen where a new supply of soup is available. If his fellow inmates demand more soup they  start banging and hammering on the tables. The score of this event is based on how many plates of soup he hands out.

Peeling potatoes is not Bobo's favorite chore but he has to do it. He has to pick up a potato, then peeling it and when that's done tossing it away. Bobo scores points based on the number of potatoes he has peeled. If a potato is not fully peeled it will be tossed back.

In the next event Bobo must help his inmates to escape prison. The inmates are jumping out of their cell windows and it is Bobo's task to get them over the prison wall by moving a trampoline around. 
The score is based on how many inmates actually can escape. Bobo must be sure to catch the inmates under the right angle with his trampoline because if he fails the inmates will crash into the prison wall.

Finally, Bobo found an way to escape prison. He must jump from wire to wire and as the wires are electrified he must take care not to be electrocuted. The score in this event based on how long Bobo can prevent being electrocuted. Bonus points can be earned by picking up the green objects that appear occasionally on the wires

In the last event Bobo has been captured by the police and returned to his cell. He can't sleep because his cell mates are snoring and to stop it he has to sing lullabies to them. He has to climb the beds and not wake his cell mates by stumbling around his cell. When all cell mates are fast asleep Bobo himself must go to bed to get some rest himself. The score in this event is based on the time Bobo is actually able to sleep himself.

    <resource id="62231a7d503113c80666dd0d777ad09d036e8662" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">The reason why Bob's having a bad day is that his head has become detached from his body, and they've been hurtled off into different places. To retrieve his body, he must progress through 50 levels, then a further 50 to escape before he can be put back together.

Gameplay involves the character being on a rotating landscape with a set number of coins placed all over it. By rotating the joystick, the player moves the landscape so that Bob moves over the coins and finds the exit. 

The levels include many spikes, contact with which causes the loss of coins; if the player has no coins when contact is made, it's game over. Some level designs are fiendish, with lots of corridors and alleyways, teleports, and bricks to break through (by building up enough momentum).

There are a host of special 'power-ups' across the level as well. The simplest ones (and the first ones the player will meet) change the direction of gravity, causing the player's character to automatically 'fall' to the left when not in motion. Others include a sticky mode where Bob stops bouncing (unless the player presses the fire button), a heavier-bounce mode, and a very useful one allowing the player to 'thrust' Bob around, ideal for reaching precariously-placed coins.

Once the player reaches level 51 a further twist is added - Bob's body starts in a separate point of the level, and this must also be coaxed to the exit. The view always centers on Bob's head, even once this is in the exit, so the player will have to use the scanner alone to guide the body across - knowing that a move which benefits one can drag the other off course.

Bob was enjoying himself. He was sat in a deckchair, sipping some strawberry cordial through a straw with a knotted hankerchief on his head, protecting his small bald spot.

Suddenly, Bob heard a noise and saw a group of aliens from the planet Mord attacking his prized garden. They were attempting to steal all of his fruit! Back on their home planet, the aliens are running out of food, so they are attempting to borrow a cup of cherries off Bob, unfortunately they forgot to ask Bob first! This was too much for Bob, so he ran immediately to action, forgetting his flamethrower, Bazooka and even his bicycle pump. All he had was a machine for producing special balls, which he had invented yesterday. The balls are special, as they never lose momentum. You drop it from a high height, and it will bounce back to that same height, overcoming air friction in the process. The only problem was that the more the ball bounces, the colder it gets, and contact with a warm surface causes the ball to violently explode. Bob isn't worried, as he was wearing Asbestos gloves while sunbathing (His hands are very sensitive to sunlight).</resource>

Five other planets are involved, each submitting 2 brav fighters - the advanced Titanica, the divided Eclipse, the prehistoric Gellorn-5, the morphed Misma, and the matriachal Feminion.

Combat works in a similar way to the original, with moves designed around a one-button controller, with special moves activated either by a particular joystick movement while jumping, or by holding the fire button to charge the move up. The one-player game sees you progress through fighting the other characters in turn. Multiplayer options include character V character and a 4/8-player tournament.

If it explodes it will increase a radiation meter on the left of the screen and when it is full you lose one of three lives.

As you defuse the bombs, fuel capsules are sprayed out by a pipe and a certain number also need collecting and put in a box and you can carry as many capsules as you want. To reach higher platforms you can either use pipes that make you bounce higher or you can fall of the bottom of the screen to appear at the top. Moving about the screen is a ball and if you touch it carrying capsules then you lose them and you also increase the radiation meter. Once you have collected enough capsules and defused a certain amount of bombs then you move to the next level.</resource>

    <resource id="cfae58b48593cdb40304fc617aae05bb957f0568" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Bomb Jack is an arcade platform game that was released in 1984 by Tehkan (known today as Tecmo). It was followed by two official sequels, the console and computer title Mighty Bomb Jack, and the arcade game Bomb Jack Twin and Bomb Jack II, which was licensed for home computers only. The highest known score was by Mr G Jones from London: 6 746 800.

Bomb Jack is a hero who can perform high jumps and float in the air. His goal is to collect all red bombs on the screen. The game's antagonists are enemies such as birds and mummies which, once they drop in the bottom of the screen, can morph into things like flying saucers and orbs that float around the screen, making Jack lose a life if he touches them. Collecting bombs will increase the bonus meter at the top of the screen (collecting lit bombs increases it more). When the meter is completely filled up, a circular bouncing &amp;quot;P&amp;quot; appears, and when collected, it will turn all the enemies into bonus coins for a short period during which Jack may collect them. Other similar bonuses are the B (Bonus) which increases the score multiplier (up to 5x), the E (Extra) which gives an extra life, and the rare S (Special), which awards a free game. There are five different screens in the game, each featuring a distinct scheme of platforms (the fifth has no platforms at all). There is a special bonus for collecting 21 or more lit bombs in a row, out of the 24 bombs of each round.</resource>

The player's &amp;quot;shot&amp;quot; can be used to temporarily neutralise enemies, open gaps in walls (revealing in the background a picture of a naked lady), or stun competitors in the multiplayer (up to 4 players) game.  Once enough bonuses have been collected, doff a condom and hop into the sack with the blonde in the middle of the screen.  Level layouts vary, but basic gameplay (and even the cheesecake in the background) remains much the same through 50 levels.

The multiplayer game features an additional surreal mini-game, where the alpha phalli prowl the screen's periphery around a model who seems to love nothing more than to have select garments of her clothing pawed by stretching penises with grasping hands inexplicably appearing at their ends -- you've never seen anything quite like it.

The player controls a dog flying a World War 1 plane, able to shoot both other aircrafts in the air (controlled by humorous caricatures of dogs, pigs wearing WW1 helmets and other animals) and bomb targets on the ground for coins, via a fixed crosshairs like in Xevious or Twinbee. These coins can be spent in between levels to purchase weapon upgrade and extra lives from a vending machine. Also in between levels the game offers a few false-3D flying stages where we see the plane from behind and have to fly through a tunnel while trying to avoid the walls. There also are a few end level bosses, mostly farm animals. The game is imbued with humor: destroyed enemies plummet to the ground like Wile E. Coyote from the Road Runner cartoons, accompanied by funny voices and sound effects, matching the cartoony feel of the game.</resource>

This figure asks them to collect certain items that he has placed inside various buildings to test his security force. If they return the items successfully, Mobo and Robo will be rewarded. The two of them state that they will get the job done in just three minutes. However, little do they know that each building is packed with security guards who will raise the alarm if they are caught red-handed. Fortunately both Mobo and Robo are equipped with bullets that can knock the guards unconscious for a few seconds. An $100 reward will be given out if Mobo and Robo are apprehended.

As either Mobo or Robo, you must collect all the treasures before leaving the ten buildings and shoot any security guards that get in your way. Remember that you are under a time limit. An in-game map will help you locate the treasures. There is a bonus stage after three buildings, where the object is to collect the gold bars in a limited amount of time without  one of the three spotlights shining on you. If it is possible, hide behind open doors. If you manage to get all the gold bars, 10,000 points is added to your score. There are three of these bonus stages, but each of them varies.

You are presented with a top-down view of an array of inter-connected blocks, which are shown in a variety of colours. The aim is to turn them all to grey, but clicking on them (using the pointer you are in control of) will often cause a pattern of other squares to change to the next colour in the sequence as well. You are doing all this with a time limit for each of the 300 levels. A level designer allows you to create your own sequence of up to 1000 levels.

As a platform and blast adventure, you must progress through all levels by collecting the various icons scattered at the most inconvenient of places. Who put the required object on a platform that demands a super-hyper jump from a dangerously high-up ledge?

It's not all run, jump and shoot, though. Sub-levels include a puzzle game against the computer where you shuffle square blocks about a board in an attempt to recreate the original pattern. There's also a turbo bike section, featuring an Outrun/Lotus perspective. Final words: Frustratingly slow and tedious with minimal action.</resource>

It is disguised as futuristic sports event in which the player fights against five opponents. The basic idea is that each playfield has a large opening on two sides which are guarded by remote-controlled robots. Each of the opponents controls a robot with the goal to reflect a bouncing ball so it enters the opposite opening. If that happens, the screen switches to the next of five areas, e.g. if the players were in the second chamber, they either switch to area one or three depending on who scored. A player needs to score a certain amount of times to win a match.

Variations to the areas (which are the same for each opponent) consist of obstacles covering the middle of the room. There is also the possibility to charge up the robot which results in a more powerful and fast returning of the ball, but when overdone it causes the robot to explode.</resource>

Whichever one passes the test of IOZU will become the grand master and dominate the rest. To pass this test the wizard has to defeat the dark side of his spirit by completing a series of memory puzzles. A pattern is displayed at the start of each level, which then has to reproduced by you. Unlike most games you don't control the pieces. Instead you operate a little wizard who has to scurry around collecting the pieces of the pattern as they fall from the heavens and then place them on board. The presentation is very slick. There's a good intro with sampled sound and a snazzy picture. The menu screen has a couple of finely animated dragons and there's an option that lets you trade gold (points) for tips which is another nice touch. 

Brain Blasters is fun to begin with, but after the fifth level, or so, the novelty value begins to pale. There's a two-player mode where a couple of wizards can battle it out for the pieces but even this becomes boring. Devotees of memory puzzles in The Express will probably like this, otherwise you'd be well-advised to try before you buy.</resource>

The player controls Jonathan Harker, who, on his quest to destroy the Transylvanian vampire, must make his way through nine levels, starting at a tavern near Dracula's castle and then the castle itself. Back in England, Dracula and his minions must be driven out of a convent, an abbey and the house of Jonathan's fiancée Mina, among others. A primary task in each level is to find and destroy several coffins of Transylvanian earth. Hindering Jonathan on his way are henchmen as well as critters under the vampire's control: bats, rats, snakes and more. The last coffin in each location is usually guarded by one of Dracula's stronger minions, which include his three brides, the madman Renfield, and Mina's friend Lucy, now turned undead.

To defeat the enemies, Jonathan uses punches and kicks. Lost health can be regained by finding potions; extra lives are also available. In addition, Dr. Van Helsing has left holy crosses lying about - once picked up, they enable a powerful ranged holy attack, which only lasts for a short time, however. Staircases and doors connect the different parts of the levels - to open doors, keys must first be found.</resource>

You do this indirectly, by specifying which direction he goes in, in a manner vaguely similar to Lemmings. You also tell him when to use objects in a simplistic manner similar to the Dizzy games.

The game combines reactions and planning in quite an original way. The character himself isn't at all cutesy, as the title implies, and that may affect your perception of the game.

Brataccas is a place where greed and corruption rule the day.  The residents are treacherous, and while they can be bribed they are not above murder, so be careful out there.

But some rebel groups haven't given up hope yet and fight against the oppressors. When one of them gets caught, they are being transformed into cyborgs and stuck in complicated mazes that function as arenas, where they have to fight for their honour and maybe their freedom.

Breathless is a first-person-shooter, where the player has to navigate various stages infested with enemies out to get them. The player has a status display at the bottom of the screen. It contains the current score, the remaining health and shield as well as energy and credits. Energy functions as a universal ammo stock, with each of the weapon depleting a certain amount. By picking up credits, the player can buy or upgrade weapons at computer terminals.

The player's goal is to reach the exit of each of the 20 levels. However, there are usually doors in the way that have to be opened by finding the right switches, or obtaining certain key cards to progress further into the maze.

Controlling a bald child, you move through a scrolling array of ledges, avoiding contact with nasties who release coins when shot. There are hidden areas to find as well.

Halfway through the first of the 30 levels, you meet Squeak and the full nature of the game starts. Squeak is a blue alien, who must also be guided through the levels. As he can't jump as high as you, he must sometimes be instructed to wait while you flick a switch or otherwise solve the puzzle of how to guide him through. If you stand on top of Squeak you can be launched into an extra-high jump.

Bubble Mode is an equivalent of Super Mario mode - it allows you to jump higher, run faster and shoot more lethal weaponry (bubbles in this case). It is activated by placing a coin into a Bubblegum machine, and then jumping on Squeak's back.

In between the main platform levels there are side-view shoot 'em up sections taking place underwater – completing these earns bonuses.

The only way to transform back is to reach the end of the cave...

Bubble Bobble is a platform game, with each level being a single screen. The enemies must be cleared from a level to go to the next one. With one player controlling Bub and the other controlling Bob, the player can jump and collect items for points (such as fruit). The real power Bub and Bob have however is the ability to blow bubbles. These bubbles can be as platforms to leap on, or to trap enemies. Enemies trapped in a bubble must be popped by jumping into them, wherein they'll turn to fruit. Additionally, power-ups sometimes float by in bubbles. They include lightning, which flies out horizontally at enemies, and water, which drags the player and enemies straight down flowing over platforms. Taking too long to complete any level will summon Baron Von Blubba, who will float around the screen trying to destroy the player.

    <resource id="70da91b84f462682fb0c0a74561cba901cf2c719" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Bubble Gun is an Action game, developed and published by Weathermine, which was released in Europe in 1994.

The story behind Bubblegun is a simple one. You are a small crocodile with a gun that can fire bubbles (hence the inspired name) who is trapped in a castle and has to find their way to freedom. Quite why they are trapped in a castle, or why they are carrying a large gun, or indeed why they are trying to escape isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t made clear at any point, but then who really takes any notice of game plots these days?

What you are left wit is a very basic platform game, where you begin somewhere in the middle of a four-way scrolling maze. Dotted around the maze are a variety of objects, such as points bonuses, energy bonuses and time bonuses, but the most important things to look out for are sections of keys. You can carry three items at once, and there are three sections to each coloured key, so it isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t too much trouble to build up a complete key. Once you have the key built, all you need to do is find the chest with a coloured lock that matches it. Open the lock and fruit and gems fall out. If youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re really lucky, a block with Ã¢â‚¬Å“ExitÃ¢â‚¬Â written on it will appear. This is the key that opens the level exit, and is the one thing you are looking for.</resource>

Fans blow the bubble off course.

The player has a realistic range of moves and must use them wisely, as Ki (life-force) is drained for every move made, whether successful or not, and both this and your stamina level must be kept high.



You can practice your skills alone, or spar against the instructors or your friends. Finally, when you feel you are ready, you can travel to the martial arts world championship tournament at Budokan.</resource>

First task is to throw knives at a spinning board upon which a surely-terrified and fortunately-skinny lady is locked  - make sure to adjust for the rotation that will occur in the time your shot takes to hit. You get points for missing as many times as possible before hitting. Event 2 is based on shooting ability and is in two stages. First you must shoot the targets of criminals (but not innocents) as they emerge from the ground, next you must shoot the bottles they throw at you from over the horizon.

Event 3 is Calf Roping, in which you must position yourself so as to be able to throw your rope around the poor cow's neck. This is followed by Bronco Riding, in which you must adjust your balance to compensate for the Bronco trying to throw you off, by pushing the joystick out to balance two bars. Level 5 starts off like the Cow Roping, as you jump onto a Steer, before a joystick-waggling section starts. Last of all is a side-scrolling game in which you jump onto a stagecoach which has been invaded by Indians, and beat up the hijacker.

The location is your home, a garden that overnight has become very untidy. Around you swarms of insects and bugs are flying about mindlessly with no interest in helping you clear up the mess. They have been brain-washed by the Evil Slug. Now you must arm yourself with a insecticide spray gun and begin your quest of restore the garden to it's normal order.

The gameplay is quite simple. You simple pick up the trash and throw it into the trash can. At the same time you should stay clear of the bugs or insects or you will lose energy which is equivalent to health in this game. The magic mushrooms that are in the game can be shot at to regain energy. There is also other pickups that will come in handy during the game. The game is divided into days and each days ends with a boss fight, i.e. an enormous frog.</resource>

    <resource id="e54d38bc8ca923ca36dd642335e579ec910701f4" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">The story of this game is quite simple, presented during the intro as a series of short scenes without words. Melba is an easy-going guitar player who is having a picnic with his girlfriend; suddenly, an ultra-strong, evil-looking character appears and kidnaps the poor girl, sailing away on his ship. The brave Melba swims after the ship, and finds a bottle with a map inside. Knowing now the way to the evil kidnapper's lair, Melba embarks on a journey without further hesitation!

The premise, the map with the &amp;quot;stages&amp;quot;, and the side-scrolling view indicate a platform-type action game; in reality, however, Builderland is a puzzle game, somewhat similar to the famous Lemmings. As in Lemmings, the player has no control over the protagonist himself (except on a few occasions, when &amp;quot;boss&amp;quot; enemies must be defeated by throwing certain objects at them). Instead, the player must manipulate the environment in order to build a path for Melba, deal with the enemies, etc. Melba is for the most part entirely helpless and simply walks forward automatically. Various items such as boxes, weapons, platforms, etc., must be collected and placed properly in order to save the hero from premature death.</resource>

The computer racers include Loretta L’Amour, the Buck-Toothed Beavers, and the uncompromising Colonel Carnage, each of which have individual looking cars, varied weapons, and some attempts at humour and pathos.

The courses are quite lengthy, and are laden with hazards and power-ups such as oil slicks and homing missiles. The computer cars appear to be faster when behind you than when in front – strange.

The handling is deliberately arcadey, with fast acceleration and braking as well as the chance to brake and steer at the same time. The graphics are third-person, with a split-screen option, in the grand Mario Kart / OutRun tradition.

The screens contain rows of bricks, some of them indestructible, and lots of doors to open for access to other sections, and dividing lines affecting where the ball can go. Power-ups are released at regular intervals. You need to press fire as the ball approaches to strike it and keep it in play.

Like a Role-Playing-Game, you travel through the world and meet many computer-played characters. You want to rule the world. But there are other 3 characters with the same aim.

You spend the most game time looking at the map, which takes up several screens. The position of the 4 characters, their occupied conquests, the cities, and the health condition of your character are shown on the map. 

The different settlements you can occupy are old factories, camping-grounds or ruins of old mega-cities. The five great cities are opened for all competitors and can’t be occupied. In these cities you cannot fight against your enemies. 

Sometimes you meet a human for changing news, items or take them in your party. There are different classes of computer-characters: fighters, engineers or doctors for example. Every character of your party can carry up to 6 items (food, weapons). These items are produced by the settlements you control.

Needless to say, young CJ sets off to rescue them.

The game is a standard platform title, in which you can shoot peanuts at your enemies, or use bombs you collect.

You start with 9 lives, which sounds generous, but the levels are full of spikes and bad guys which can come to get you at any point. The enemies include policemen, Indians, dogs and burly American footballers (quite a stereotypical view of Americans there). Each level has a guardian at the end.

That means trekking halfway around the world, armed only with an infinite supply of peanuts and a handful of bombs (fortunately more can be collected as you go along).

You start with nine lives, but the game's design is such that a lot of deaths will be unexpected, so prior knowledge of the layouts is essential to get through most sections of the five levels without losing lives. The two-player mode involves the screen following the lead player, so the latter can lose lives by getting too far behind. With lots of precise jumps across vertically-progressing ledges involved, a lot of skill and timing is required.

Your ship is a small white triangle, in the centre of a black screen. When the game starts, asteroids, large irregular rock shapes, drift gently into view from the outer edges of the screen. Your ship can rotate in either direction, and fire, so this is what you must do, in order to prevent your ship from being destroyed. As your shots hit the asteroids they break into smaller and smaller fragments, and the directions and speeds imparted to them seem to be highly convincing.

Cabaret Asteroids is a near perfect conversion of Asteroids for the Amiga. Its not in technicolor, there is no music, and the sounds are simple but effective. The playability of the original has not been surpassed though. I really can't fault the Cabaret Asteroids conversion, you can play by keyboard or joystick and it feels just like 1980, but without Sting and the guys in the background.</resource>

You must build the city, placing crucial features such as housing estates, roads, policing, water supply, social events and the like. You’re not restricted to one city – you can build another area, linked by roads, once you’ve got the first one running smoothly. You have slaves at your disposal to build and maintain everything. 

All this would be easy if you had an infinite supply of money, the civilians didn’t complain about anything, there was no threat of combat, and you didn’t have to keep the people above you happy. Needless to say, all of these problems crop up.

Via the forums,  you will get public opinions, which are affected by how high taxes are, and whether people feel they’re getting value for money. If they don’t they could riot;– what will you tell the Emperor if that happens?

Barbarian threats are commonplace, so you need to maintain an army, and at times send it into battle. If you own Cohort 2, you can fight the battles using that, but otherwise you just issue the orders then learn of the result.

You can take involvement at many levels of a battle. You can take direct control of either driving or gunning a tank, direct groups of 16 tanks and their support units, and create a combined overall strategy factoring in supply routes. Over 150 different vehicles from both sides are featured.

It's a hard-core wargame that will like mostly to the &amp;quot;aficionados&amp;quot; of the genre. The game package includes a lot of extras: a thick &amp;quot;Equipment factfinder&amp;quot; manual (170 pages), 2 huge posters, replicas of WW2 postcards and of a newspaper.

The characters are controlled indirectly using the mouse, as you activate each soldier or group of them by highlighting them, click the left button to move them to a particular spot, and the right button for them to fire guns at an enemy. You can also pick up grenades, which can be used to destroy groups of enemies or buildings (by pressing both buttons at once). 

Each mission has a specific objective, and some feature vehicles such as tanks to make things easier. Your troops can cross water but can't shoot within it, so finding and controlling bridges is often crucial. You can use the arrangement of trees to find hiding places to shoot from, and should watch out for CPU soldiers also doing so.

The basic gameplay remained the same – guide a team of soldiers through a succession of levels populated by trees, huts and lakes. 

The major change is that the plot involves time travel, rather than straightforward war situations, and this means levels taking place in different scenarios including a strange ‘Alien Planet’. 

The levels include a variety of vehicles such as jeeps, tanks and helicopters, which can be used to shoot or even run down enemy soldiers. Standard bullets are joined by collectible grenades – use these wisely, as nothing else can destroy huts or vehicles. Finding strategic defence positions can be vital as well.

The action takes place in the Capone era of 1920s Chicago.  The player is a lone gunman battling Capone’s men down the streets and alleys of the city.  The game plays much like Operation Wolf.   As the game progresses, the screen scrolls sideways and evil gangsters pop up from behind windows and buildings.  The player must take care not to hit innocent bystanders, including women, children, and pets strolling down the street.  There are also two indoor scenes, including a warehouse filled with TNT and the finale that takes place inside a bank.  Capone was released in the early years of the Amiga, and had a very unique look for its time.

Although the major selling point of Capone was it was the first light-gun game available for the Amiga, players could also play entirely with a mouse.  During mouse play, a cross-hair cursor appears on screen.  Firing is accomplished simply by hitting the mouse button, or trigger on the light-gun.

He is gradually transformed into a machine and must find and destroy his five clones before he loses his human form for good.

The action takes place in Hydra, an imaginary universe, where the player moves from planet to planet, meeting aliens with different characteristics, who may or may not help him to accomplish his quest. Captain Blood's Ark is characterised by its relatively innovative dialogue system, allowing you to create sentences from icons in order to communicate with the aliens.

The player controls a biological ship called an Ark, and must launch probes onto the surfaces of planets, successfully navigating them across the landscape to locate an alien. The Ark can also scan planets and sometimes teleport aliens to different locations.</resource>

The other day you were trotting into hospital ready for your tonsil operation. Dead easy you thought. Just a couple of days with a sore throat. It came as a bit of a shock to wake up in a new body on a different planet. Since youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re trapped, you decide you might as well sigh up with the QueenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Cloned Highlanders troopers.

Your first mission involves you fighting your way through the multi-level enemy base, alone or with your partner (you need tow players if you want to win), to destroy the master computer. Pass codes and switch systems, open doorways and operate lifts. By the way, the mission is said to be impossible. Nice thought, eh?

Simulataneous two player action is just about this gameÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s only strong point. The screen is split into two as you are forced into co-operation to negotiate your way around 22 levels of blaster-tron infested  nastiness.

Great intro sequence but poor in-game appearance with long messages that you canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t speed up. The graphics represents small and poorly animated sprites with some repetitive backdrops. Loading tune is amazing, but poor in-game effects. Overall, a sub-standard search game from a company that has given us much better.</resource>

If the time limit of level was reached a demon like creature called Turbo was released which homed in on the play within 15 seconds and this would cost the player a life.

The objective of the game was to drive over every platform in the level which changed the platform in some way (for example, in the construction zone the platforms are girders with holes for rivets. A rivet would appear in the hole once it was driven over), once every platform was run over Arnie would be picked up by a helicopter and taken to the next level. At the end of three levels, Arnie would rescue an animal friend and continue on to the next themed level.</resource>

The actual graphics when throwing the javelin, sprinting, hurdling, long and high jumping, have been designed and recreated from live video footage. This is apparent when you first see the animation as it really is top notch.

Your armies can be supported by catapult and elephant-mounted units, but only if these are already available and you find them first (building doesn't really come into play). Guarding the hills also gives you an advantage in combat.

Each unit becomes more skilled and happy if they win battles, but fatigue comes into play if they fight too frequently. You need to pay for the soldiers, which is done by producing goods to trade.

Actually distributing the cash appropriately involves transporting it via Chariots, which improbably leads to an arcade racing-type sequence in which you must avoid not only rocks and trees, but also Roman chariots (why they are heading in the same direction as you every single time needs explanation) - contact loses you money.

    <resource id="87bba911cbe805477b863b15fe0b6bb1d53f4050" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Castle Kingdoms is an Action Adventure game, developed and published by Mutation Software, which was released in Europe in 1997.

This is an isometric arcade-adventure. You control a party of four brave warriors who each have their own individual strengths and weaknesses, and you must fight your way through five castles filled with bad guys. You can only control one character at a time, though, and the others will follow the character under your control.

The game was fun enough to play, and the presentation is good, with some nice music in the background and unremarkable, but cute, graphics. All in all, Castle Kingdoms is an okay game - for an hour or two.

The game is available as a part of a couple of compilations: Mutantology (Epic Marketing), and Mutation Gold (Mutation Software).</resource>

A vampire hunter named Simon Belmont bravely ventures into the Count's mansion in order to defeat him. Along the way he'll have to defeat skeletons, bats, fishmen, medusa heads and other evil creatures.

Castlevania is a side-scrolling platform action game. The player taking the role of Simon Belmont is able to jump and crack his whip directly in front of him. Power-ups can be obtained by defeating enemies or by whipping candles that appear in the castle. One such power-up increases the power and length of Simon's whip.  Different weapons can be gathered which consume hearts when used, these hearts can also be collected from monsters and candles. Additionally, some walls will hide secrets such as the health-restorative turkey or the Double and Triple shot abilities for the weapons Simon has collected. At the end of each section of the castle is a boss, which must be defeated. Progression through the castle eventually leads to a confrontation with Count Dracula himself.

Usually the player has to dodge appearing obstacles or fighting a boss enemy, e.g. in one level a dragon has to be defeated or the prince sits in a canoe.</resource>

Hordes of monkeys have escaped from the zoo, and he must return them, alive. He does this by tempting them with bananas, of which he has a finite supply, before hitting them with a baseball bat to stun them (logically, tranquillizer darts would make more sense, but this way the game involves getting close to the monkeys, making things tougher), before boxing them up (again, the number of boxes is limited) to return safely to the zoo.

The levels on which this must be done consist of a number of platforms, ladders, ledges and the like, and are played against a time limit. Falls stun Jeff, potentially allowing the monkeys time to escape, or drop banana skins to disrupt him.

    <resource id="126cf7f405147b323405a3becc142e77d400bb4e" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Starting as a young Roman legionnaire in 275BC, your job is to conquer the known world through force or diplomacy, fighting on land and sea. 

Centurion: Defender of Rome is a turn-based strategy game. You start with one province, Rome, and one legion. To complete the game, you have to conquer all the provinces on the map. 

One part of the game is micro-managing your provinces. You set up tax rates and make people happy by organizing games. In Rome, you can organize a chariot race, a gladiatorial combat or even a simulated naval battle; this starts an action mini-game where you control the chariot rider, gladiator or ship. 

Another part of the game is military conquest. You can raise legions or strengthen them in any province you control (let's just hope there are enough men in the province, or your legion will be incomplete and weaker). There are three types of legions, each of them has a different strength. You can also move a legion to a neighbouring province. 

When you enter a province you don't yet control, you can speak with the ruler there. With luck, you can convince him to give you the province for free; but this isn't very likely, and you'll often have to fight. 

When your legion attacks a province, or defends one of your provinces from an invader, the game switches to an isometric view of the battlefield. You can give orders to your legion (assuming they are within the range of their commander's voice) and watch as they duke it out with the enemy forces. Eventually, one of the sides will be completely wiped out or panic and retreat. 

Finally, you can buy warships and have naval battles with the enemy fleet. This is represented as an action mini-game, depicting a duel of the flagships; however, the outcome of the battle actually depends on the strength of your fleet.</resource>

But evil has not left Krynn. In northeastern Ansalon, outposts of the Knights of Solamnia remain to guard the fragile peace. Your party of adventurers is hired to carry out missions for the Knights. On your first mission, you stumble upon Draconians, long believed to have left the area. What are their plans? On your travels you have to face dangers in many dungeons and towns and might even meet some of the legendary Heroes of the Lance.

Champions of Krynn is the first of SSI's &amp;quot;gold box&amp;quot; games set in the AD&amp;D world of Dragonlance, with all the usual features: first-person view and movement in dungeons, towns and outposts, overland travel on a map of the area and tactical turn-based combat from a top-down perspective.

As the first game set in Krynn, it has several features unique to that setting: In character races, one can choose from Kender, Silvanesti or Qualinesti Elves and Mountain or Hill Dwarves in addition to humans and half-elves. Special character classes include Solamnic Knights, clerics of the major deities of Krynn and mages of either the Red or the White Robe. The deities grant special spells and powers to their respective clerics. Red and White mages have access to different spells and the phases of the moons of Krynn affect their spellcasting abilities.</resource>

For every hit the game shows a 3D and overhead view of the situation, so the player can plan the next steps accordingly. The golf game itself is menu driven: the player changes various parameters, e.g. the golf club, the direction, the golfer's position, the strength and if the ball is hit in the middle or an outer edge. According to those parameters the game calculates the hit, which even may result in a straight miss, and then the next planning phase starts. The player may play a championship with all 18 holes or a training round with a single hole.</resource>

You must be careful not to run off track, or into the other cars, as this causes the car to slow.

Your car has 3 gears, and you push fire while accelerating to go up a gear, and push it while braking to go down (which makes it harder to recover speed after an incident). The circuits are full of hairpins, traffic (not all of it in direct contest with you for position) and hills - rising over those can be precarious. The races are over 4 laps, and each lap's timing is displayed on screen, along with the distance left to complete this lap.</resource>

There were 6 characters available in the game, each with different strengths and weaknesses, and different starting prices. In 2-player mode you each chose a character and played co-operatively, but in one-player games you also choose a character for the computer to control, with its Artificial Intelligence allowing it to open doors, pick up power-ups and take on baddies away from the ones occupying your character.

Our two heroes decide the only way to stop him is follow him, but unfortunately luck isn't on their side...

Game plots are usually terrible. This oneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s brilliant. Walking down the street one day, Charles gets crushed by a falling grand piano, dies and goes into the Netherworld. Which is somewhere, but not really anywhere. So he has to trudge through 28 rather similar levels of platform merriment to get back from somewhere. Which isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t really anywhere.

In the tradition of platform games, the idea is to dodge, jump, collect and kill across seven worlds (including the odd bonus room) of horizontally-scrolling action, picking up keys along the way to gain access to the next level. Despite the changes of scenery, the application remains the same. Oh, and there are coins to collect, though IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m not sure why. Interestingly, the number of goodies you collect or baddies you kill determines where you end up - altering the end sequence accordingly. Stunningly average stuff, indeed. An A500 version is also available.</resource>

Then you drive across the city without crashing into other cars, and catch up with the criminal's car. To arrest the suspects, you must keep bumping into their car until it is no longer functional. And you have to do this under a strict time limit. You can't afford to crash into cars or buildings or you waste time getting on the road again. 

However, once you've caught up with your suspect, you are given more time. Your car is also equipped with turbo boosts, which you can use to gain extra speed if you are way behind the criminal. Each arrest is based on a &amp;quot;suspicion&amp;quot;.

Built into the program is a pull-down menu, giving it's performance against Chessmaster 2000, Chessmaster 2100 and Colossus X, in 10 games apiece.

The game was designed to improve as it played, so over time a game that played against good players would be much better than when it first began. Users have the option of saving, so that the gained intelligence isn't lost.

The game includes classic and whimsical chess pieces, one set includes farm animals (sheep pawns, dog rooks, horse knights, chicken bishops, cow queens, and pig kings). Another setting includes Science-Fiction pieces that look like aliens. The game can be played in 2D or 3D, and includes digitised speech.</resource>

Exploration may seem familiar to players of Civilization, Colonization, Conquest of the New World, Gold of the Americas, and even Sid Meier's Pirates!, as they borrow from exploration and cover a similar topic. </resource>

After the events of the first game, you attempt to return to France of 1922, your own time period. A disorder on Explora, your time-machine, makes it use up all its metal fuel, leaving you stranded on an unknown time era. You need to find enough metal for Explora to be able to return you to your place in time. The original point-and-click interface (text-based with auxiliary icons) was replaced by a fully icon driven one. There's a row of icons at the bottom of the screen with movement arrows, a save game icon, &amp;quot;get&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;give&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;examine&amp;quot;, etc. The conversations with characters have a basic form of speech-synthesis which can be turned off (the full text of the dialogue is displayed either way). The game boasts 13 different locations and multiple time stages.</resource>

    <resource id="febabed8ed3e9f6a9f1af869d133c9f6ef23a551" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">In the game you play Hen House Harry who has to collect 12 (a dozen) eggs from each level, while avoiding the ducklings. The levels each occupy a single screen, and are made up of platforms, ladders and lifts (or elevators), and are thus similar to those in classic platform game Donkey Kong. Corn can also be collected, which stops the time limit from ticking down and also stops the bonus, collected when the level is completed, from decreasing. The ducklings also eat the corn, however.

There are only 8 distinct levels. The ninth level is a copy of level 1, the tenth is a copy of level 2, and so on. However, on the second time around the ducklings that can use the platforms and ladders are replaced by the Mother Duck, who can fly around the level going through the platforms and ladders. On the third time around, you have to face both the Mother Duck and the ducklings, and similarly on subsequent goes round, when there are more ducklings.</resource>

Whereas the original game features eight levels of one screen each, this features many more screens arranged into a maze for you to explore.

In the game, Hen House Harry must build a giant chocolate egg, with the ingredients (cocoa, milk and sugar), that are found in the factory.  Eight of each must be included.  Also, the eight parts of a toy kit must be found, to place inside the egg.

In order to get all the items you must find your way around the factory, avoiding many types of enemy, and solving puzzles using various items that you can carry.  There are a number of ways to get around the factory, including the platforms of the original, but also ropes and pipes, among other things.

Despite the drastic changes from the original, the game still retains the sound effects from the original.

Circus Games!

As a tiger trainer, you will have to put the tiger's through their various tracks. You have to do various stunts, like corkscrews and somersaults, on the trapeze.

As a tight rope walker, you need to go from one side to the other, doing handstands and somersaults along the way. There is also a lady daredevil that you do stunts with from the back of a horse.

If you do the international competition, you will have to do certain tricks for the trapeze, tight rope walker, horse trick-rider and make the tigers go through all the tricks in their routine.

Avoid collisions with trams, other cars (driven by annoying citizens), buildings and road blockades etc., while trying to reach the next checkpoint before the time runs out! Use your horn to alert other road-users of your presence.</resource>

    <resource id="79014864347dd2dab70d0537617fcba52716659b" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">This top-down puzzle game starts with a screen featuring a number of red cogs at different parts of the screen, and a grid of pegs (which become less complete on later levels). Your task on each level is to use a number of gears of one of 3 different sizes to ensure that all the cogs are linked together. All this has to be completed before the engine overheats.

Making life harder are two creatures with the peculiar name &amp;quot;Poffins&amp;quot;. One of these goes around removing pegs, and the other causes the engine to overheat further. They can be shot out of the way, or have gears placed over them to stop them.

There's also a bonus round, which is a fruit machine, only with cogs and other things from the game rather than fruit.</resource>

The levels consist of a collection of cogs, which can be rotated either clockwise or anti-clockwise to achieve this goal. There are lots of special blocks to help out, including bombs, diamond-producers and anti-gravity blocks. Each level has its own time limit, ranging from seconds to minutes - this doesn't start until you make your first move, and you can look around the level at your leisure before making a stab at it. Each level has its own password, which makes progression a little easier.</resource>

Viewed from above, his challenge sees him having to progress through these worlds, collecting keys to gain access to different sections, and avoiding enemy balls and bugs by jumping them where possible. There are no 'lives' as such, but there's a strict time limit of around 400 seconds for the whole game, and death puts you back to the start of the level, with time lost as well. You get an extra 80 seconds for completing each level though.

The levels feature all manner of further hazards - there are holes in the ground to avoid falling through (some visible, some hidden), arrows which force the ball in a particular direction, slippery squares making any movement's effect exaggerated, magneted squares making it impossible to jump from, and many more. Fortunately lots of power-ups, time boosts and bonus fruits are dropped onto the levels at random intervals as well.

To complete the game you must clear 8 levels, and the structure is non-linear - initially you have a choice of 4 levels, and after completing one of those you have a choice of 4 more levels (which are different depending on which level you completed first). The third and fourth levels you take on as you go through the game are chosen from a choice of 3, the fifth and sixth from a choice of two, and only those final two levels are perscribed (although they do vary depending on which levels you've already done).

Each of the 32 worlds has its own twist - Arrow Kingdom has a large amount of arrows directing you, Ice Kingdom is especially slippery, Unseen Kingdom leaves you to work out the route for yourself (other than the holes, which are all you can see), Box Kingdom involves a lot of flying over some trapped squares to grab the keys they contain before making the main jumps onto the sections which contain crystals, and so on.</resource>

To reach it, he needs to solve 82 isometric levels by collecting all balls and diamonds spread out over the tiles. The levels also have different plains which are changed by either using a ladder or jumping. However, jumps and shots for his gun need to be picked up first - which is made more difficult by the fact that the symbols move over the level. Over the course of the game the difficulty and complexity rises at a steady rate, e.g. at first there are no enemies, later the enemies walk on pre-defined ways and even further down the path they actively try to hunt down Beppo. It also introduces more and more gameplay elements along the way, e.g. one-way tiles, teleports, funnels, speed-up tiles or death tiles. Some tiles change their colour when walking over them and having them all in the same colour when finishing the level gives major bonus points. Also useful are two different pyramids which stop or kill enemies when dropped in their way.</resource>

The game requires at least a 68020 processor, which is understandable considering the amount of action going on at times, and the speed and visual detail this is conveyed in. It was one of the few Amiga games to include a Virtual Cockpit mode, and this can be controlled using the mouse with a quick button press.

The game’s missions are set up in such a way that you are not necessarily the lead man. The two sides fight each other irrespective of your placement, and act on instinct with unusually complex AI, meaning that the exact nature of the missions vary each time you play. The missions all involve shooting at the enemy planes, helicopters and tanks though, and there is no particular war structure in terms of the mission orders

Surprisingly, Tunisia remains one of the few countries still in possession of large quantities of high-quality oil. USA and Soviet governments race each other in their attempts to purchase as much oil as possible. Finally, the Soviets take a step further and kidnap the US ambassador, hoping to provoke an international incident. Naval Officer Johnny Westland is sent to Tunisia with the order of rescuing the ambassador and preventing further escalation of the conflict.

Code-Name: Iceman is primarily an adventure game similar to Sierra's other works in that genre. The player navigates the protagonist in eight different directions from third-person view, and types text commands to interact with the environment. The command &amp;quot;Look&amp;quot; may be typed separately and lead to different text descriptions depending on where on screen the protagonist is positioned. The game is similar to Police Quest series in that it relies on realistic procedures, in this case military instructions, first aid, etc. The player may reach dead ends and resort to restoring an earlier save if some of these procedures are not followed properly. In addition, a considerable portion of the game consists of submarine simulation, requiring the player to navigate a submarine and fight enemy craft.</resource>

    <resource id="5c6fb7d62b3ec93361abdf8c50abd66b807d3c7b" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Coloris is a Puzzle game, developed by Signum Victoriae and published by Avesoft, which was released in Europe in 1990.

This is a puzzle game similar to Columns. The player has to deal with falling down blocks which are divided into three parts (stacked up vertically). These parts have one of five colours which can be rotated by using a button (for example if the combination is white-blue-red it becomes red-white-blue). The goal is to create lines of three or more parts of the same colour. When they vanish, above lying parts fall down and may create a chain reaction.

All this rewards points and if enough of those are gained, the player gets access to a fallback-feature: slowing down the falling speed of the current block. However, this only lasts for a short time and costs points. A game ends if the blocks reach the upper part of the screen. Additional to the normal playing mode, there is a second one in which random blocks get added to the lower side of the screen in regular intervals.</resource>

The circuits are based on real ones, although the opposition (of which there are 9) are known simply by first names such as David and Paul.

The display appears to use real 3D, with some fairly terrifying directional changes, although it doesn't tilt as you turn. A full map of your position relative to your rivals is presented at the top of the screen. Crashes cause gradual engine damage, reducing your initial 140mph top speed by a slight amount each time - you'll also lose time as you rejoin. Before each race you must set a qualifying lap, which allows you multiple attempts.

The game has a built-in track editor.</resource>

Trees, rivers and bridges create a varied combat-like terrain and must be incorporated into your thinking. Extra grenades can be collected, and will definitely be required, as they allow you to kill form distance and thus avoid some enemy shots.

The game is played in rounds of three months, split into several phases such as declaration of war, movement, battle and construction.

You begin the game by declaring war. Which front you open up first will determine the further development of the war. Warring nations are split into two kinds – great military powers such as the allies and the axis, and neutral states.

One resource to be househeld with is your gross national product. This is the resource that will be expended when you build up your armies, and eventually send them to war.

The game has a multitude of scenarios, each with its own goals; just killing your enemy is not the best way to win, if at all.

Just as in the board game, the action takes place on a hexagon map of Europe.

A group of horsemen raided his village...Conan was knocked unconscious, awakening only to find his wife and his friends butchered in the aftermath. Conan discovers architect of the slaughter was a wizard named Thoth Amon, a high priest of Cult of Set. Sword in hand, vengeance aflame, Conan now travels south in the land of Hyborea to the city of Shadizar. Here his journey of vengeance begins...

Conan: The Cimmerian is an action-adventure game with some RPG elements. The game is divided into 3 areas. The first is the overland map, where Conan may travel only between identifiable town and other locations. The second is the town map, here Conan is viewed in a horizontal 3rd Person and the last is the combat screen (or when he enters houses) where Conan is viewed in vertical 3rd Person. Conan may also view his character status and inventory sheet, anytime during the course of the game.

Gameplay consists of exploration and combat. The exploration element in the game sets Conan to find his way around towns and hidden locations, often breaking in houses and searching the premises for hidden loot. Towns consist of various places to visit, among others temples which usually offer quests, shops offering weapons and other items, and inns to stay for a health boost. NPC’s may be conversed with to seek information, while the tougher-looking types may be provoked into combat.

Combat is real-time, one-on-one with Conan on the left and the opponent on the right, consisting of only movement to the left or right and attacking. There are no defensive maneuvers. Both must now keep on attacking until the health bar of either side drops to zero. If Conan wins, he may search the remains and may find loot. At the beginning of the game, Conan may only use one sword style (swing) out of three available sword styles. Additional sword styles may be trained by a sword master.

Some special actions can be selected, like deploying special units, attack with chemical weapons or even nuclear ones.</resource>

The goal of the game is generally to destroy all enemy tanks on the map using a preset squad of tanks of your own. The tanks on the player's side that aren't controlled by the player act on AI, but the player-controlled tank can be switched at will via an in-game map. Alternately, the player can use that map to direct tanks to other places - but even when planning troop movements on the map, the game goes on. To top things off, there is also a limited amount of resources allocated to the player and can be gained by destroying enemies; these resources can then be used to buy new tanks before the start of the next mission.</resource>

    <resource id="61dbeda35f7c1f2b5906b151118797a070b7bced" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">The year is 1193, and the Third Crusade has just ended. Richard the Lionheart, King of England, returns to Europe from the Holy Land. On the way, he is ambushed and abducted by the soldiers of the Austrian duke Leopold. The duke demands a large ransom to be paid in exchange for the king's freedom. However, the king's brother, Prince John, is content with the situation and plotting to take the throne for himself. That is when the legendary Robin Hood, one who robs from the rich and gives to the poor, decides to raise the money needed to liberate the king, with the help of his fellow outlaws of Sherwood Forest.

Conquests of the Longbow is an adventure game and a follow-up to Conquests of Camelot. It uses an icon-based interface common to most contemporary Sierra adventures. Like its spiritual predecessor, it differs from most other games in the genre by reducing traditional inventory-based puzzles in favor of exploration and varied tasks dictated by the situation at hand. These include talking to characters, gathering information, making decisions, solving riddles, or participating in mini-games such as combat, archery contest, and Nine Men's Morris (with adjustable difficulty).

The game is divided into days; each day is completed when certain tasks have been fulfilled. It is, however, possible to fail some of those tasks and still advance the plot. Several situations can be handled in different ways. The player's decisions affect Robin Hood's ranking towards the end of the game. Number of points scored, the amount of money collected for the ransom, and the fate of Robin's fellow outlaws are considered when awarding the rank. Depending on these factors the player reaches one of the four possible endings, ranging from Robin getting hanged to a happy conclusion of his love life.</resource>

The first race is in Brazil and features 100 cars, and requires you to finish in the top 80 in order to qualify for  next race. As you work through the 8 races the size of the field steadily decreases, but so does the worst acceptable finishing position to qualify.

The car has high and low gears, and is susceptible to damage from contact with another car. Once you hit a car or a piece of the trackside scenery you will be called into the pits - fail to make it back, or hit another car, and you will crash and lose several seconds.

Cool Croc Twins has been very well presented (you even get a free T-shirt in the box!) and fortunately has been very well written as well. A level return-code facility (which lets you skip all the bits you've done before) and the simultaneous two-player head-to-head mode makes it a game which won't just get put away. Eventually it will lose its appeal because of the lack of variety or different screens. An in-built screen designer would have made it a brilliant package but as it stands, Cool Croc Twins is still very, very good.</resource>

On the first one, you will be on a wild island, a place in which we will have to face endless hordes of pirates whose only obsession will be killing us. Some of them will use all kind of deadly weapons, such as the famous saber or a blunderbuss. Luckily for us and unfortunately for them, our protagonist is quite capable when it comes to fight with punches and kicks. So if all goes well, you will find a small boat which is awaiting you at the other extreme of the island.

The second part, to which we can access without the need of finishing the first one, takes place in a pirate galleon. There we will have to represent the role of the hero once again and we should try to rescue the beautiful damsel. Now the game system is quite different from the first part, because we will be no longer able to directly blow our enemies, but we will have to use a sword to finish with all of them. The objective consists in ascending to the pirate flags which are in the different masts of the ship and, in the end, to arrive where the girl is before she ends being food for sharks.

Two players race against each other on a plain and each vehicle leaves behind a trail which is deadly by touch. The goal is to trap the opponent; obviously the surviving party has won the battle. The screen is split into three parts: the upper and lower ones show a 3D view of the plain with the camera fixed on one of the two players and in the middle is a radar view.

The variants to this known principle are a limited amount of jumps, the ability to control the speed of the own vehicle and two AI difficulty levels. Regarding multiplayer, there can be only two vehicles on the field at the same time. However, more participants can start a tournament with knockout rules.</resource>

Not only that, but it also finds itself at some distant place in the universe.

Now it has to travel through 22 automatically scrolling levels to find the way home. Movement consists of bouncing, and there are many obstacles like holes, disappearing floors or death tiles to avoid. Most platforms disappear after a touch and the player can use a limited function which creates a platform under the tennis ball. Failing a level, e.g. by falling in a hole, causes a life loss in the 11 main levels. After every level there is a shorter bonus level. It is still possible to fail the level, but instead of losing a life the player just gets teleported to the beginning.</resource>

It offers several missions to the player, all with the goal to hijack a space truck. During the course of the game the player will undertake increasingly more dangerous and difficult missions.

This game is a multi-directional shooter. For each mission the player gets transported to the estimated destination of the truck. However, the correct space sector has to be found first through the means of elimination. The player uses warp beacons to go to the next sector and when the correct one is found, the radar shows the way to the truck. 

However, every usage of a beacon costs money which is earned by shooting alien ships in the current sector, which can be freely explored in all directions. Every killed enemy gives credits and probably leaves an extra behind which gives advantages if picked up, e.g. bonus credits, a protection shield or a smart bomb. Money left after finishing a mission can be reinvested into ship upgrades.</resource>

Trouble is, no one believes his tale of the planet he discovered! Your job is to help Linus make his way back to planet Earth so he can take some pictures to convince his friends. Gameplay consists of two parts, an adventure and arcade action. In adventure mode you can explore lands, find objects, and talk to people. Sentences can be constructed by using the pointer to select actions or objects on the screen (This is similar to the interface LucasArts used in games such as Maniac Mansion.) To reach many new locations involves the action mode, where you will need to cross treacherous landscapes and evade dangerous creatures. This portion resembles a side scrolling platform game. Once you've cleared an action sequence, you will not need to do so again if you decide to revisit a location. Whenever you wish you can receive a password allowing you to continue the game later from the same point.

The crux of the play chiefly consists of making your way around the decks of each of the three main levels of a space station, negotiating hostile automatons with your trusty laser blaster. Access hatches about the station can be searched, and yield helpful items such as extra health, oxygen or laser ammo. The primary objective on each of the three levels is to reactivate all of the safety computer panels.

At times during play, the station may be attacked by an armada of alien war ships. Where by you must find the on-board teleportation system on that level, in order to beam yourself to the tactical station, to man the defences, and neutralise the threat. This portion of the game takes place from the first-person perspective.</resource>

Well, here you can play with up to three players against one of eight digitized women. Each time you make a girl lose all her money, she takes off some of her clothes (4 of the 8 girls feature &amp;quot;movies&amp;quot; of the strip, which consist of half a dozen frames).

At the beginning of the game, you may select your language at the beginning and can also choose to turn the girl's comments on or off. Finally, the game features a zoom function with which you can get even bigger pixels.

Cheats :

Increase your speed to 204mph, press Ã¢â‚¬ËœF10Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ to pause the game, then press fire. The game slows down to a crawl, but you can still steer the car. So, by continually pressing fire and moving left and right, you can safely pass road obstructions!</resource>

    <resource id="d15556e2fb0d0e4654f0d6d6df7767d2a8667dee" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Crazy Seasons is an arcade game about two cute penguin scientists who are working on a time machine on their space station when their computer crashes (poking fun at the Amiga's &amp;quot;Guru Meditation&amp;quot; crash screen), which threatens to create a temporal anomaly and mixing up the Earth's seasons. It is up to the two penguins to rearrange the blocks powering the time machine in order to avert the catastrophe.

The gameplay is very reminiscent of Taito's Bubble Bobble and Parasol Stars: the penguins are respectively blue and green and move around single-screen levels defeating a variety of cute enemies which leave food and valuables behind when killed. The twist here is that the goal of each screen is not to clear every enemy, but rather to arrange four blocks bearing four distinct geometrical shapes in a specific pattern shown on the bottom of the screen, which changes for every level. The blocks are also the main weapon at the player's disposal, as they can be pushed into enemies to defeat them. Occasionally, a bonus may appear which gives the penguins a gunman hat and revolver, to make dispatching the baddies easier. The game presents a boss fight every few levels, ranging to farm animals to dragons. Aside from the tunes composed specifically for the game, the music also includes 16-bit remixes of Vivaldi's Four Seasons, coherently with the game's title and premise. In between the various seasons, the game offers a few entertaining cutscenes complete with slapstick comedy.</resource>

The people of Ereanor were relieved when the brave girl Sue destroyed the horrible sorcerer &amp;quot;Wizard of Doom&amp;quot;. The liberation of Ereanor was followed by a three day's celebration. But a dark shadow fell over the Kingdom of Ereanor. The sinister &amp;quot;Mistress of Death&amp;quot;, the sorcerers wife, is out to get even. Ereanor became a hell on Earth. People became destructive creatures, animals became killer beasts and even plants turned evil.

Sue was not harmed by any of the spells, and from now on lived in her own world, which was worse then her scariest nightmare. To take whatever was left of Sue's pride, the mistress of death kidnapped her teddy-bear...

That really did it!  Like she did once before with the &amp;quot;Wizard of Doom&amp;quot;, she now decided to fight and beat the &amp;quot;Mistress of Death&amp;quot;. Help Sue, and start your battle against evil itself.</resource>

Until they such a planet, they call themselves the Fuzzy Wuzzies.

Their colony ship collides with an asteroid, and crash lands in the Pacific Ocean, near an unchartered island, which they colonise, calling it &amp;quot;The Hippest Place in The Known Universe&amp;quot;. Unfortunately the island is also home to rather nasty demons, who can't stand the commotion caused by the happy Fuzzies, or their silly name for the island.

The demons kidnap the Fuzzy Wuzzies by hosting a massive party, then capturing them in a net, and dragging them off to the torture chambers. The only Fuzzy not caught is Clyde Radcliff, who was already being sick in the bushes. He wakes up in the morning with a really bad headache, and fiery halitosis, and sets out to destroy the demons, and rescue his friends.

The game consists of 3 levels, each made up of 3 of stages. The first two stages of each level are side scrolling platformers, where Clyde must destroy the enemies by firing at them, presumably using his halitosis. At the end of each of these stages, Clyde meets a witch, who can provide him with extra firing patterns, or upgrade those he has, in exchange for 'magic potion creatures' found during the stages.</resource>

    <resource id="5583b33e7695440cd42688f04d098b722ea0fb72" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">A variation of the classic arcade game Frogger, designed to make use of the Amiga's hardware.

The basic gameplay involves guiding a frog into one of 7 home-bases at the top of the screen, which have hard barriers either side of them (avoid these). This involves first guiding him across a road, avoiding the vehicles, then over a river using moving logs.

In this version the road has a variety of machinery to dodge, ranging from standard cars to lorries - hitting one kills your frog and leaves a red splodge in that part of the screen - a nice touch. The rivers also have families of turtles appearing intermittently - these can be used to cross a level, but they don't stay up for long. There's also a 2-player mode in which both players compete to get into the same slots - player 2 using a yellow frog.

You have a 60 second time limit for each frog on the first level, and 5 lives at the start. Once all 7 slots are filled, you get a 50-point bonus for each one, and move on to the next level. Progressively you have less and less time, more traffic, less logs, and a few other difficulty elements - the part in between the road and river has a chicken marching across to avoid, and a crow swoops overhead ready to grab your frog.

Croak 2 attempts to simulate, as accurately as possible, one of the most fascinating stages in the lifecycle of the Australian Cane Toad. As everyone knows (I didn't), the eggs of the Cane Toad are laid within the carcasses of dead sheep. The tadpoles quickly mature in this nutrient-rich environment, and soon there's a multitude of young toads, ready to begin their famous migration to the nearest creek or river bed. This journey frequently takes them across busy roads and rivers, whose erratic currents and high toxicity defy the bulky toad's best attempts at swimming.

If you can't remember, or if you have never played the game before (where have you been?), the basic idea of the game is to get your frog from one side of the road (at the bottom of the screen), over the river and into your home (at the top of the screen). To complete a level you must dodge cars and jump on logs, while avoiding snakes, alligators and otters. Bonuses are awarded for getting the bugs that momentarily appear, escorting lady frogs to their home and getting five frogs safely home.</resource>

The player takes the role of Tell who tries to end the reign of the evil duke Gessler.
This is an action game with puzzle elements in which Tell explores the environment, talks to people and collects everything he finds. The objects are either used to solve puzzles, are a good bribe or go into Tell's equipment. This is because the forest is no friendly environment: wild animals and Gessler's black knights want to eat/arrest him. In this case Tell has to fight his way out without losing too much life energy. It can be restored by using found provisions.
Controls are almost completely icon driven. So for example for walking right, the player needs to click the &amp;quot;go right&amp;quot; icon, to pick something up the &amp;quot;pick up&amp;quot; icon needs to be pressed and so on.</resource>

There are also ghosts which cause the player to lose a life when touched - at least until the cruncher eats a special ball which causes him to eat the ghosts.

The game is all about reflecting a ball against a wall of bricks. Behind the wall of bricks live some worm-like creatures that will come out to disturb you when you've opened a hole in the wall. Prolonged contact with the creatures will kill your bat. Destroying bricks will often cause a coloured brick to come spinning down slowly. These spinning bricks are power-ups, altering your ball or bat according to their colour. You can have a sticky bat (green), a wide bat (blue), a slower ball (yellow), multiple balls (cyan), and the decidedly Arkanoid-inspired shooting bat (red). Whatever you do, don't pick up the grey brick, or you will be destroyed.

Quite an interesting concept, this game involves you using the sparks from your magic wand to break blocks that may be in your way. You can control where to point the wand too. Other than that, very basic. The presentation is good, in terms of graphics and music, but the actual gameplay is a bit slow-paced and difficult to get the hang of. In all fairness though, it's pretty good for a freebie.</resource>

Plotting revenge, he began poisoning the minds of the nations of the world. Black elves and orcs became his minions. The gods flooded the land in response, secluding the island kingdom of Arborea as the last stronghold against Morgoth's forces. Jarel, the last Prince of the elf-like race of Sham-nirs, must find allies who would help him on his quest to obtain four elemental crystals, restore the power of the temples, and defeat Morgoth.
Crystals of Arborea is an RPG which is a precursor to the Ishar games. The party of six characters roam the world (on a 2D map or by exploring 3D individual locations), defeating Morgoth's minions, gathering experience points and becoming stronger. Unlike the subsequent Ishar games, combat in this game is turn-based, and takes place on separate screens.</resource>

According to cult programmer Tobias Richter, you view it from the top with all sides displayed, and allow the player to choose the number of sides, from 4 to 25.

A large number of different starting arrangements are offered, grouped by difficulty. Rather than having a level-based progression, you can choose any of these from the start. A number of different tunes are provided, written by Team 17 cohort Bjørn Lynne.

These bonds have dangerous magical powers that can take control of the heroes at the most inopportune times. They must now search for the source of the bonds, and free themselves from the curse.

The second in the  Gold Box series of role-playing games, Curse of the Azure Bonds is a sequel to  Pool of Radiance. The gameplay is nearly identical to that of the predecessor and other Gold Box games. Following the  AD&amp;D rules of role-playing, the player creates a party of characters (up to the maximum of six). Two new character classes (Paladin and Ranger) are added to the four basic AD&amp;D classes Fighter, Thief, Mage, and Cleric, which were available in Pool of Radiance. Exploration takes place in pseudo-3D environments, from first-person view. Battles (random as well as pre-set) take the player-controlled and enemy party to a top-down battle screen. Commands are issued in turn-based fashion, and the player-controlled characters can freely navigate the battle field. There is also an overview &amp;quot;world map&amp;quot; that allows instant traveling between cities.

It was infested by parasites which drain the energy and the player's job is to fend them off.

There are three tombs, each of them are extensive environments which scroll in multiple directions. The player uses a jet pack for movement and searches for the pods which the parasites are using to extract the energy. They have to be brought to a special room to destroy them there. The goal is to get rid of all pods in a level, but the parasites have something against this. And so they actively try to kill the protagonist, but fortunately he has ten weapon systems at his disposal to shoot back. Well, at least if he bought them from special silos with earned points. The total energy reserves of the tomb act as time limit.</resource>

Decent graphics, much better than in many commercial releases, but unfortunately animation is weak and control over the fighters is horrible. You can get used to it, but after some time it becomes tiresome. Nevertheless, if the game was a bit polished, it could have been quite good.</resource>

By 2022, the game was played not by humans, but two teams of seven robots. To spice things up, the usual pig skin ball was replaced with a 350 pound bomb.

Cyberball brings this fast and furious action to life. Gameplay is essentially the same as the real sport, although the 'downs' are replaced by the bomb's heat gradually increasing towards 'critical'. After this it will explode and possession will be swapped. This is prevented when you cross the 50-yard line, lose possession or score a touchdown, in which cases it resets to 'cool'. Field goals and punts are not featured - the only kick is the initial kick-off you receive.

Control passes from the quarterback (thrower) to the intended catcher as soon as a pass is released. The two-player game is co-operative - on offense one player passes and the other receives.</resource>

It can happen! And it has! Finally, a PD game - all right, shareware, but still darned cheap - that l can wholeheartedly say is better than a lot of the commercial stuff that's available. New Zealand-written slice of freely distributable software. My life has meaning once more!



So, why is Cybernetix so good? Well, it certainly isn't originality. It s basically Defender meets Asteroids on steroids. A sideways-scrolling blast-'em-up where you have to obliterate everything in each section which comes complete with a variety of power-ups, bonus lives every 10.000 points and a smart bomb. But there are three main reasons why it shines. It looks stunning, it plays like a dream and it's fast. Faster, in fact, than a very fast thing.



The graphics are pure quality. The asteroids really look 3D while the substantial-looking ships explode into shrapnel, and some even start spouting smoke and spiraling out of control when they are first hit and need to be hit again. The controls are very responsive, which they need to be at the speeds this game reaches. The radar is also very clear and you need to keep one eye on it to see where the alien ships are when they're off the main screen.



There are tons of sectors to clear, some with special missions, and a two-player option. Oh yes, and the sound is also superb.



VERDICT: The concept might not be all that original, but the game has so much style, action and playability, who cares? Do yourself a favour, and get It now and remind yourself what good old blasting is all about.</resource>

The 501st Cyber Assault Squad. The foreign legion of the future; armed to the teeth with high-tech weapons and wearing power assisted armour, only these rock hard commandos are tough enough to take on the universe - and beyond...

Lead Raa, Gee, and Bee into battle against terrifying alien life forms, on missions that are more than just another bug-hunt. Time is running out... The drop-ship is ready to roll; and you are about to board an express elevator to hell... Going down!

You are given five missions to complete, each mission has four decks. You can use teleport pads to warp to another area of the deck. If you don't complete your mission under the given time limit, you'll fail your mission and the game ends, and stopping you from completing your mission are a horde of aliens. Some areas are guarded by a steel door, and the only way that you can open it, is by obtaining a red, green, blue, yellow, or black ID card. As well as the doors, there are force field gates, which can be deactivated if someone in your team carries a force field key. At the end of each mission is a boss waiting to terminate you on sight.

Raa, Gee, and Bee can carry up to six items in their inventory. The first two places are reserved for weapons. The four remaining places can be filled with ID cards, disks, smart bomb units, and shields. If one of the team members already have six items and they pick a seventh item up, then that item replaces the active inventory item (which is shown by a white border around it).

During your mission, you can access terminals which require a red, green, blue, or yellow disk which can be found either lying about, or it is dropped by an alien. These terminals allow you to bypass door circuits, view deck blueprints, and scan restricted information. The blueprints are useful if you can't find your way around a deck. Also with these terminals, you can obtain several items like force field key circuits, party shield orbs, time distortion cubes, and much more.

In between each mission, you are given a passkey, which you can enter at the title screen. This passkey lets you start a new mission later. If you haven't discovered the cheats earlier, they will be revealed when you complete the game.</resource>

    <resource id="b2a84bd18ea56eed6ece399e6346260c0764e565" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Cyberzerk is a top-down shooter in which the player has to cleanse a big space ship from all inhabitants. This is accomplished by using either the standard gun or a limited supply of grenades. The ship consists of various levels which in itself are divided into non-scrolling rooms which are navigated by using one of the exits of the current screen. The death of every enemy - which mostly move on a set path without actively hunting the player - within a time limit is the requirement for finishing a level.

Getting hit by an enemy causes the life energy to go down and running out results in an instant game over. To counter this, energy refreshments are sometimes left behind by killed enemies. Other extras are grenades and a map which shows the layout of the current level but can be used only once. The co-operative two-player mode features friendly fire.</resource>

Choose from three classes of bike (125, 250 and 500cc), and between 8 (Japan, Australia, USA, Spain, Italy, France,England and Sweden) and 15 (Japan, Australia, USA, Spain, Italy, Western Germany, Austria, Yugoslavia, Holland, Belgium, France, England, Sweden, Czechoslovakia and Brazil) original tracks depending on the version, at five difficulty levels (with the lower ones offering automatic gear changes). 

The player can enter single races (always including qualifying) or complete in a full season. The action is viewed from the handlebars of your bike, a novelty for motorcycle racing at the time. The game engine is similar to that used by Grand Prix Circuit, but now incorporates hills.</resource>

The game proposes to be a general in command of Allies group and optionally perform certain actions by yourself also. Such actions include:
1. Piloting a plane over French territory to bomb strategically important places; 
2. Landing on hostile territory as paratrooper; 
3. Breaking through enemy lines as infantry soldier; 
4. Driving a tank and fighting as a tank team with enemies in French village.

All kinds of gameplay differ in looks from 1st or 3rd person perspective in simulator-like missions (tank and plane respectively) to isometric (infantry) and platform (paratrooper) with corresponding actions made in all of them. All such military actions may be played as single missions or combined and also strategically managed on the map during a real-time approach in Overlord campaign. The game progress may be saved to be restored later.

Multiple options allow to turn off participation in certain or all military actions as well as adjust enemy actions including even such event as 'Hitler does not wake up'.

Before you play the main events you have to train in the gym. Weight-lifting, squats and sit-ups are included, which involve waggling the joystick as fast as you can to fill a displayed bottle of Lucozade (clever bit of product-placement there). The better you do at this, the better you'll fare in the events, which are predominantly waggling-based as well. They include the standard decathlon events of running, jumping and throwing as well as you can. There are four types of shoes available, and choosing the wrong one for the event will seriously hamper your performance.

Within only a few hours, the comet will obliterate Eris.

It is your job to prevent this. In the maddeningly short time frame, you will have to explore the galaxy (which contains 9 planets and 19 moons) and try to find a way to stop the comet.

Just like Mercenary, you play this game in the first person perspective, this time however with detailed filled polygon graphics. You can walk on the planets, drive vehicles and fly spaceships. It is very non-linear, you can go to any planet and any moon at any time and do whatever you like. You'll have to find and use objects and examine buildings and places... and stay away from Eris if you can't destroy Damocles in time!</resource>

Every time you mess a trick up, the scene has to be cut. If there are too many cuts, you'll lose a &amp;quot;life&amp;quot;.

Graphics aren't very good unfortunately. Sound isn't that much better: the intro tune is poor and the in-game FX aren't really anything in the way of a step up. Not Rainbow Arts' finest. A surprisingly sub-standard quality product from a company famed for raising standards.</resource>

    <resource id="2fb6409d24b3376f8649ea05212b6ecea0dbb35c" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Darius was Taito's effort to compete in the arcades against the likes of R-Type and Gradius. Technically impressive, it featured three screens depicting the largest playfield seen in a game so far (the same system was employed for Ninja Warriors), with the player sitting atop a big set of loudspeakers. Visually and audibly, it was a league above Irem's and Konami's offerings.

When Taito (and others) ported the game to home machines, they were forced to shrink the playfield to fit in one single screen, and re-dubbed it Darius Plus.

The plot of Darius involves the two heroes Proco Jr. and Tiat Young fighting the menaces posed by galactic fish and other sea animals again their homeworld.

What sets Darius apart from other shoot'em-ups of the time is its way of letting the player choose his path with a certain amount of freedom. At the end of each area (level), you are able to choose between one of two worlds which the area branches into. This renders a higher replay value, since there are many paths to reach the end of the game by.
Apart from this, the gameplay is on the simplistic side, both due to unimaginative attack waves and little interaction with the surroundings, but mainly due to the very basic powerup system, which is nowhere near the complexity of the aforementioned R-Type's and Gradius'.

DarkSpyre a top-down &amp;quot;dungeon-crawling&amp;quot; role-playing game. The player creates the protagonist, choosing gender and magic specialization (healing or offensive), as well as customizing his/her combat parameters. The game consists of navigating the tower's complex levels (39 of them must be traversed to complete the game, though there are 50 altogether), fighting monsters in action-based combat. The protagonist can equip a variety of weapons and armor; weapons can break after excessive usage, and armor will deteriorate in quality if worn for a long time. Spells are learned from scrolls found in the tower. The hero gains weapon and magic proficiency by repeatedly using the same weapon and/or spell.</resource>

You start as descendant of the Pharaoh who was exiled from his kingdom. Your mission is to return to Cairo and claim the throne that is your birthright. You have to prove your worth to the people of Egypt by conquering neighboring lands and defending your kingdom from attack.

You can make offerings to various Egyptian gods in hopes of divine aid, marry a bride to ensure that your line will continue if you fall in battle, wage wars with neighboring countries, and so on. To construct the various buildings, you will need to find different types. Your starting city will not have all the raw materials available, so you will be forced to conquer your neighbors early on.

Combat takes place action-style. You will ride in a royal chariot, shooting arrows at the invaders who will throw lances at you. Divine favors, when they are granted, can result in complete annihilation of your enemies, but those are very rare and depend mostly on luck.</resource>

Unusually the multiplayer game was split-screen, which didn't really work because you could sneak a look into the other window to see where your opponent was - it's not exactly full of suspense.

The major compromises in getting the game onto the A500 are the graphics, which lack texture-mapping, and the trick-3D used where the characters don't rotate smoothly in 360 degrees, but jerk through a small range of viewpoints, a la Dungeon Master. Only half the screen is used for the actual motion as well, with the rest reserved for RPG-style artwork - which is obviously superfluous because the 2-player game doesn't have it. It's a throwback to the first Lotus game of all things. You can even turn the animation off.

In one-player mode there are 34 levels, accessed via passwords, 3 lives, and lots of powerup weapons. If one player completes the level, both advance to the next one (like Lotus 2, funnily enough. I guess I ought to think of a similarity to Lotus 3, just to complete the set). There's also the standard Death Match mode.

The theme of the game is medieval fantasy and it takes place in a castle (divide into five levels) which is where the trap in the title comes from. The trap has been set up by the magician king Shankriya and has been existing for five centuries. It's the players job to make things right again. The game has a wide variety of enemies from ghosts to fireball throwing magicians. Defeating some enemies gives the player the player a flask with some liquid that can be converted into spells and such.</resource>

    <resource id="b4ec28201d6b6dc100f64acf529571cc91b2e664" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">The Unique Selling Point of Deathbringer is the amazing parallax scrolling Ã¢â‚¬â€œ each of the 36 lines of the background scrolls individually, making for the closest thing to a real-life effect yet seen. It's very impressive indeed, but it would seem it didn't leave much memory space for gameplay, because Deathbringer is so thin in that department it makes Barbarian II looks like, I don't know, Sim Earth.

In most of these horizontally-scrolling beat-'em-ups, gameplay is a simple matter of walking for a bit, coming up against a bad guy, fighting to the death with him, walking on a bit more etc. Deathbringer boldly does away with the 'fighting' bit, allowing you to quite happily walk right through any of the enemies who block your way, meaning that you only have to kill the occasional one in order to keep your sword (which lusts for blood and will kill you if it isn't 'fed' regularly) happy. Now and again there are big end-of-level-type baddies to kill or simplistic dodging sequences, but otherwise that's yer lot.</resource>

It's the player's job to find the sources and shut them down, but the slightest intervention can have ramifications on a worldwide scale.

Début features a fusion of both traditional arcade side-scroller action and a complex planet simulation. The arcade sections feature multiple levels as the player descends deeper into the planet's infrastructure, shutting down reactors, halting pollution, and eliminating bad guys.

The simulation part of this game presents a 3D satellite view of the planet, allowing the player to scan various attributes of the ecosystem below. Both elements combine to present the player with two separate and complimentary goals that need to be fulfilled - both careful monitoring and influence of the planet, together with direct hands-on intervention.

As an added bonus, there is a sound generator called &amp;quot;Vibes&amp;quot; included that allows various loopback and reverb effects to be applied to the game's soundtrack.</resource>

Designed to teach students about decimals and fractions, the player must help navigate a man through a haunted dungeon. Numerous stalagmites block the player's path, but if the player correctly answers a math question, the stalagmites will temporarily lower to the ground allowing the player to pass. If the player answers incorrectly, they are dumped through a trap door by a bat. The goal is to reach the top of the levels by continuously answering questions correctly. It contains three levels of difficulty, and a variety of different math problems including converting fractions, decimals, and percentages, as well as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division questions.</resource>

All the enemies launch missiles or mines at the boat which can be dodged by moving left or right. Water bombs can be dropped to get rid of the enemies - but there are only eight available which slowly refill over time.

Sometimes a helicopter drops crates which include useful extras like smart bombs, steering rockets or additional speed. The ship can also turn into a submarine to collect things under the water. Every screen has a different objective, e.g. collecting an orb, bombing an underwater station or destroying a powerful ship.</resource>

    <resource id="882298d484bfefeac630520423f7a0dc6c0a0cc3" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Defender of the Crown puts you in the role of one of four Saxon knights in medieval England, in a time where the land is in turmoil as the King is dead and his crown was stolen. The Saxons and the Normans blame each other and fight for control of England.

After a short introduction by Robin of Locksley himself, you start the game with a single castle and 10 soldiers at your command. From there, you have to build your army, take control of additional territories and fight the three Norman lords - and sometimes your Saxon friends as well.

The game has several different styles: You may either engage in a jousting contest where you have to knock your opponent off his horse using a lance, you can go raid a castle for loot or you can attack another territory/castle.

The game was originally created on the Amiga platform in 1986 by Cinemaware with wonderful graphics by James D. Sachs and great music by Jim Cuomo, then ported to the PC whilst keeping its original appeal and quality.

That's because this strategic puzzler involves using mirrors to direct a beam of light across a succession of 60 screens. Each mirror has 16 different angles it can be set at, each of which will send the beam around the screen in different ways.

Before the exit is activated, all the mines on a screen must be cleared by running the beam over them. There are other devices built into the levels, including teleports and random angle-changers, as well as hazards to avoid (they cause the beam to overheat) and droids which go around moving the mirrors' directions.

This isn't as easy as it sounds, because this scrolling platform shooter has many sections in which the fairies are falling towards fiery pits, and you must catch them without hitting this pit. 

The controls allow you to jump, and then jump again while falling, so you can, with effort, climb most of the way up the screen. The forces of the Black Queen are out to stop you, including spiders, bats and goblins, and even the clouds and stalactites on the ceilings launch deadly droplets of distilled doom. A bonus level is offered sporadically, allowing you to collect coins for extra lives - although you start with 9, you'll need them, as the levels are long and treacherous.</resource>

Vigdal: &amp;quot;Deluxe Galaga is based on the game StarBattle on the old VIC20. That was one excellent game, that I had a lot of fun with. It's also some features from the games Galaga and Galaxions. I played Galaga on an arcade machine, but it was so long ago that I have forgotten how it looked like. My version of Galaga (or StarBattle) is a simple shoot'em up game with good game play, but not so much fancy graphics. Many of today games have lots and lots of graphics, but when it comes to game play they really sucks. They have manuals covering hundreds of pages, and you need hours and days to get into the game.  What I want from a game is some relaxation for a couple of minutes, and then be able to quit the game and do some more work. And not to mark the calendar for when I want to play the 60MB hi-tech game!

You are in control of a small starfighter, and your mission is to protect the earth from alien attackers. When you start, your ship have limited supply of bullets and are moving a bit to slow, but by shooting the aliens you can collect the falling bonuses and get all sorts of weapons, extra speed and a lot of other goodies! When you are hit, some of the weapon power is lost and also speed and any bonus time you have collected. This loss is bigger on the hard level. There are double shoot, triple shoot, super weapon, extra life, smart bombs, money, warps, secret bonus level and much more to be collected and added to the starfighter. Look out for mother ships, rockets, warp malfunctions, super guardians and Super Cash Ship! There is also a lot of secrets in the game, you can find this secrets yourself, or you can buy them in space-shop. The space-shop will appear every fourth level, but you must have more than 50 credits to enter the shop. There are more than 10 secrets hidden in the game and some that are not listed in the game!

The Sub Games: 
Meteor Storm: You must navigate you ship through a field of big rocks floating in space. Some of the rocks have bonus point on surface and can be collected. There are also some money containers floating around. Collect these and get some extra shopping money.  You will get a super bonus if you complete the meteor storm.
The Memory Station:  Try and find a pair (Two blocks that look the same) in a matrix of blocks. If you find a pair you will get the bonus that are one the blocks. You only have limited time to find as many pairs as possible. If you find all the pairs you will get a bonus.
The Warp Malfunction: Shoot and try to survive the attack of the warped beast from outer hyperspace.&amp;quot;</resource>

Vigdal said: This is my personal version of the old, but still wonderful game PacMan (or maybe Jelly Monster). It's not a copy of the original because I have never played the arcade machine. This  game was written after some good memories of the game 'Jelly  Monster' on the VIC-20. This game was one of the first games  I had on the old 3.5KB computer, and my brother and I were
 fighting like mad to beat each others high score. The heart pounded, the adrenaline was flowing in great amounts, and the  fingers shivered.

The game is like this. Our yellow hero Pacman must eat all  of the pills in the maze to get to the next maze. But danger  lurks in the maze. Four evil ghosts are looking for Pacman,  and they want to stop Pacman from getting to the next maze.  In the maze there are some power pills that Pacman can eat,  and he can then kill the ghosts for a limited time. There are  also some fruits that popup from time to time, and Pacman can  eat these for extra bonus points. And sometimes some special  tools will appear which, when eaten, may affect Pacman or the  pills or even the ghosts. Some will speed up Pacman, some  will give random points and some will lead to extra levels.

I hope you have got the plot by now because it's really simple - just survive in the maze as long as possible and get  the highest score.</resource>

Dennis is a platform game across settings such as Sewers, the Park, and Mr. Wilson’s house, each of which has an end-of-level bad guy. The in-level opposition follows standard attack patterns and can usually be avoided. The enemies regenerate as you move on, although you generally only progress from bottom-left to top-right anyway. 

Some of the holes in the ground are deadly while others lead to secret rooms. Fortunately, you are given up to 9 lives at the start, and lots of extra lives are on offer throughout the game, so these are well worth checking out. A choice between music and sound effects is offered.

While the game shares themes of space exploration and resource gathering - plus some elements of its interface - with its predecessor, the two are different in gameplay.

The object of Deuteros is to mine and manage resources, explore the Solar System and beyond. For this, 3 categories of civilians are trained: Producers, Researchers and Marines, out of a pool of 6000 population. The longer these teams are used, they are advanced in three levels, required for some later action (some inventions can be manufactured only by a producer who is at &amp;quot;Expert&amp;quot; level while Pilots with the rank of &amp;quot;Admiral&amp;quot; will be more effective in battles).

New bases built on other planets must be manned with new teams of Producers in order to construct the shuttles and derricks needed for supply. Some of these events are &amp;quot;milestones&amp;quot; which will trigger new technology to be researched by the scientists.

The player has to take care mostly of the transaction between the planets and the factories and distribute their supply with shuttles and long-range spacecraft. New technology (such as automatisation computers or teleport) will replace some of the player's involvement, as the player must later concentrate on war.</resource>

The United Kingdom sends a secret agent to revert the affected objects and monuments back to their original state.

Devious Designs is a puzzle game where geometric shapes have to be assembled. The player controls a 007-style secret agent that has the ability to walk on the walls, lift heavy objects and shoot. Using these, he must drag and drop the geometric pieces scattered on the screen (by standing next to them and holding the fire button) on translucent slots. Each level is a screen with a timer on the top. When the counter runs out, the level is reset and the player looses one life. Like in Bubble Bobble, various objects fall from the screen that can be collected for points, along with more useful power-ups like explosives, extra-time, extra-lives and a special block than fills a slot (it can be shot if it's not needed). Also, if the player takes too long to solve the level a random enemy appears, but it can be killed by the agent's gun.

The game starts with 6 lives and has a password system.

While an action/adventure hybrid using this license was released by Disney for the PC and Amiga, Titus also held a license to the movie.  This is a side scrolling action game, where you control Dick Tracy as he moves through five stages, shooting gangsters with an assortment of weapons.  Each stage leads to one of the mob bosses, until you ultimately capture the big man himself.

In the early 90Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s, two things just wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t die: Bruce Willis in the Die Hard trilogy of movies, and, well, 2D point-and-click shooters. Renowned software undertaker Grandslam was happily ready to dig the grave several inches deeper for both. The spade: a game called Die Hard 2: Die Harder.

Based on the 1990 movie Die Hard 2, the program sends you through five stages modeled after key scenes of the film. As N.Y. cop John McClane, you have to shoot terrorists invading WashingtonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Dulles airport by quickly aiming a crosshair at them. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll successively clear the luggage center, airport annexe and runway, then chase after the bad guys on a snowmobile and finally shoot it out on the wing of the terroristÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s plane. Each stage consists of three screens; on the last one, several tougher bosses will appear. Occasionally, civilians cross the room and pray that you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t kill them. Most dying terrorists drop power-ups, namely med-kits, armor, grenades and weapons that are more powerful or fire faster. You collect these items by shooting them in time. If you do not aim fast enough, the terroristÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bullets will drain your health; you may die three times, but after that, John McClane bites the dust once and for all. Until you restart, that is.</resource>

The game is divided in excavation areas. Each area has a set amount of money you must raise before moving into the next one. To do so, you must sell your collected treasure to the bank.

You select your &amp;quot;Diggers&amp;quot; by clicking on them with the left mouse button, and making them do a desired action by right-clicking on the screen and choosing from a icon menu.

Each clan has different characteristics and stats: for example the Grablins clan resembles fantasy dwarfs and has the fastest diggers. The Quarriors clan has the strongest miners, less likely to die in a fight with enemy diggers.

There are four difficulty levels, with the easiest acting as a trainer, as you can't reach the final level or complete the game properly with it. You can customize exactly how loud the music and sound effects are relative to each other, and there lots of subtle visual effects, such as a smoke haze coming off your ship as it incurs gradual damage.

The game's power-up system is worthy of note. Rather than simply picking up new weapons, or all-purpose tokens which can be traded in at the press of a button, you collect blueprints for a total of 32 different weapons as well as upgrades to the maximum amount of power your ship can unleash at a time. Once you reach a power-up bay (which are depicted as blue domes at the base of the level), you can add or remove weapons so as to maximize your attack capabilities.

Even those who are experts at computer chess should take a look at this game. Modern chess is only one variant offered—it has 10 versions of chess rolled onto one disk. Beginning in modern era, the program works its way back in time. The authors mined gaming history books for versions of chess that most people have probably never heard of, both modern and ancient varieties.

The list of chess variants included are: Shatranj, Medieval Chess, Turkish Chess, Decimal Chess, Los Alamos Chess, Courier Chess, Chaturanga, Chinese Chess, Burmese Chess, and Byzantine Chess.

The oldest game on the disk is Chaturanga, a variant invented more than 1000 years ago in India. More recent versions include Medieval and Turkish Chess, played in the middle ages. Decimal Chess, which has a piece that combines a knight and a queen, is a modern variant of an older game. The newest game of the group is Los Alamos Chess, which was designed to run on a MANIAC I computer with a 6x6 board. Strangest looking of the games is Byzantine chess, which has a circular chess board.

This is not just a chess game; it is more of a survey of chess history. The authors provide the histories of the games to place them into context with modern chess. They show how chess changed as it moved across cultures. They cover the basics of chess—the rules, moves—and give players a glossary with chess terms. Finally, they include a bibliography for those who want in-depth information.</resource>

Dizzy Dice features two game modes. The first one you play as a normal fruit machine. But then there also is the bank mode, where you start with $20 and need to reach $100 to break the first bank. In total there is five banks, each requiring more cash to win. The game is controlled using the keyboard.

The two players take sides in an split-screen air battle above France in 1916. Player one starts off as an English pilot on the left side, and player two flies his red Luftwaffe plane from the strip on the right screen. At the end of each strip is a tree, so lift-off requires precision; too early and you will stall to the ground; too late, and you will crash into a tree.

As the two players fly towards each other, the split screen is joint as they reach visual contact, and likewise split off again if they fly away from each other. If a player is shot down, he must take off again from his base, and the winner gains a point. In the time it takes for the other player to lift off, you are at liberty to fly to his base and bomb both him and his hangar. Beware, though, for there is an AA emplacement at the base. The anti air artillery alternates between slow-moving shots and explosive flak, the latter being much more difficult to avoid. If you manage to bomb the artillery, the opposing player is more or less at your mercy – at least until the artillery is regenerated or if he manages to avoid your bombs and shots to shoot you down.

To spice things up, both sides have zeppelins which enter the game from time to time. The zeppelins are big targets but fire at you with great accuracy. In the middle of the playfield is a lake, where German and English U-boats take turns. They can be bombed, but have the same firepower as the AA batteries.

Control of your plane is imperative. Climbing too fast will put you into a stall, while steep dives will speed up your plane. Flying too high will also result in a stall, though this option can be turned off. If you manage to fly straight at the very top of the screen, you can take a shortcut above the mountain at the back of each air field. This will wrap you around to the opposing end of the screen.

Written in AMOS, Dogfight will let the players go on as long as they want, so the winner is usually he who first reaches a score set according to a gentleman's agreement.

Some people may find the game hard, due to it's unrelenting amount of constantly attacking enemies. Luckily, the controls are simple and it's combat is very similar to the punch/kick attacks of Kung-Fu Master.  

The game was originally titled &amp;quot;The Woo-Lan Kid&amp;quot;, but was re-named to suit a younger audience.

Playing as Doman (or his buddy Baurus) you must end the tyranny of Ardan, fighting against his footmen, archers, mages and giant guards. You'll travel through forests, villages, shores and mountains, meeting NPCs, to finally reach Satan's Claw (Ardan's castle).

The game is a side-scrolling fighting game similar to the likes of Double Dragon: our protagonist heads relentlessly to the right, occasionally stopping to fight a group of more or less competent warriors who come at him. The gameplay and graphics style is similar to that of Franko, but this time a multiplayer option is offered. This game has more moves and combos (e.g.: decapitation) that can be performed and features more weapons to choose from (sword, axe, mace etc.). The package also contains a storybook.

After that it  grew rapidly, and war conflicts finally touched up the system. Peace was restored, and Galactic High Council decided to promulgate the Galactic Charter to prevent the recurrence of such events.

Military forces were taken out except elite security forces, generally members of galactic orders. The most prestigious of these orders, Galactic New Round Table, assigned you a rank of Knight, and the Grand Master of the Order gave your a first mission. It will take place on Dominium. This system threatened by a belligerent neighbor has required a military observer.

Upon your arrival after long journey in hibernation box, you were met by Selena of Antioch, Regent of Dominium. She tells you that she refused the ultimatum of her neighbor, who want to conquer Dominium. So, you have to rely on yourself and resources to defeat Dominium Baron, because your general forces are too remote to help you. Selena is grateful to your decision, and she gives you carte blanche to organize the defense of Dominium, because your starting human and material resources are very limited.

The game flows as real-time strategy. Starting with factory, you should build units to examine neighbor lands covered by Fog of War. Finding resources such as gold mines or energy deposits, you should collect them, and build more units or fill them with fuel. The map representing fields, mountains and seas, is covered with a hexagonal grid. To move unit you should point it and destination cell. After that your units are moving between cells with real-time delay, exhausting fuel points per turn. There are 8 units: Jeep, Armor, WB Carrier, Fighter, Frigate, Cruiser, Stell Cargo, and Factory. Each unit is defined by 8 parameters: Speed, Range, Fire, Shield, Tank, Radar, Capacity, and Crew. The values of parameters, which may be increased and decreased also, define the cost of unit. Advisers and Selena will contact you during gameplay and inform you on different strategical events out of your sight.

Finishing the level, 4 digits stellar code is given to you. Such level may be accessed by this code from main menu. The overall game progress may be also saved to file to be loaded later.

The game may be played by single player or by two players via cable. In two players mode may be 2 Barons or none of them.

In it, you are Donald, working to earn money, which you then spend to buy playground equipment for your nephews Huey, Dewey and Louie to enjoy.

The first job is to guide the Amquack Express around a top-down map with 8 stations, setting the junctions to ensure that packages are delivered to the correct stations. His job in produce involves catching fruits as they are thrown at him and placing them in the correct basket. At the toy store he must sort items by shape and colour, and be careful with the security switch. His final job is at an internal US airport, soring products based on their location's delivery code.

The equipment for the playground must then be purchased and arranged, helping young minds get an appreciation of money management and cash-handling.</resource>

We have seen it all now. Mutant Turtles, Biker Road Rats, Superhuman Thunder Cats, but Samurai Ducks? Come on! Well, surprising as it may seem, that is just what SupervisionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s new hero is, a fair-feathered fowl with a taste for the orient. After a good stint on the Amiga, and then on the consoles, it was only a question of time before the yellow feathered one got the taste for some CD action.

When all the hurly burly has been seen and the mystical smoke clears, Donk is basically just another platform game, albeit with a slightly oriental crispy fried duck aroma to it. He is not the greatest character to grace the video game world, being rather unresponsive and having an annoying habit of falling off any platform you try and position him on when jumping. Animated sequences also link the levels, but they are nothing special and you would not miss them if they were not there at all.

There are 112 uninspiring levels to negotiate and, if you can stick with the programme long enough, you will be able to collect the magical properties necessary for Donk to perform. The shelled one can protect himself with an egg shield and blasting bombs and a simultaneous two player mode is also included with a very restricted viewpoint of the level and reduced sized sprites. This can prove to be a laugh, but at the expense of frustration.

So, yet another flop for the humble CD thirsty machine. A huge stack of great games can only be just around the corner now. Lets hope we can all hang on a bit longer, eh?</resource>

Back in 1993, a shareware company called Bignonia ported Donkey Kong from the Commodore 64 to the Amiga. The final product closely resembled the arcade original in terms of graphics and levels (it includes the elusive pie factory stage). While the game is missing the between-level Ã¢â‚¬Å“How High Can You Go?Ã¢â‚¬Â screens, it did add an extra stage that seemed to make some decent use out of the game physics.

You are Mario, and that big old gorilla, Donkey Kong, has run off with your girlfriend. It's up to you to struggle up those ladders and balance on those beams to rescue your lady fair. She's held captive at the very top. But Donkey Kong is not ready to give her up so easily. He's tossing barrels and fireballs at you at every turn. It's up to you to outmaneuver that wily ape. Good luck, your lady awaits!</resource>

The game unusually scrolls from right to left, with the dog simply following you. The platforms are often on different levels, providing multiple routes through the game. Most hazards in the game can be shot, but others can be avoided by jumping. A number of bonus weapons and other enhancements are on offer.

The game features numerous mission where the player competes with another human player or computer in the execution of the assignment. The tasks require carrying out specific actions before opponent, f.e. retrieve documents and escape from the building, find a camera and make photographs, kill other agent. In each location various items (heavy ball, electrical device, lit cigar) can be found that can be used for setting creative booby traps inside plants, desks, file cabinets and other furniture. All traps can be disarmed with objects found in the rooms. Contact with a trap takes some of the energy. Another difficulty is the third agent that appears after some time pledging traps and attacking the other two. Each agent has a shotgun, which can be used against the enemy. Death means the loss of all items and moves the agent to the initial position.</resource>

Together, they manage a small martial arts training school, teaching their students in self-defense. One day, Billy's girlfriend, Marian, is kidnapped off the street by the &amp;quot;Black Warriors&amp;quot;, a savage street gang led by a man named Willy. The Black Warriors demand the Lee brothers disclose their martial arts secrets in exchange for Marian's freedom. The Lee brothers set out on a rescue mission to crush the Black Warriors and save Marian.

Using whatever techniques they have at their disposal, from the basic punches and kicks to the invulnerable elbow strike, as well any weapon that comes into their hands, the Lee brothers must pursue the gang through the city slum, industrial area and the forest before reaching their hideout to confront the big boss, Willy.

The original arcade version of &amp;quot;Double Dragon II&amp;quot; was essentially an improved version of the first game.

This latest in KonamiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ports of their cartridge games isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t bad, but there are other Amiga basketball games that are better. It gives a very good illusion of 5 on 5 play, but after a while I noticed that itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s really 3 on 3; two players from each team always seem to stay at the other end of the scrolling court. The play is fast and furious, with either a human or computer opponent. Graphics and sound are fair, though I did have some trouble at first keeping track of which guy I was controlling. Solid fare, if nothing outstanding.</resource>

As the lavishly-drawn comic bundled with the game explains, Spider-Man and Captain America must join forces to go to Latveria and foil his plans.

The main action in the game is a side-scrolling beat 'em up, in which you alternately control the two characters. They each have their own moves to deal with The Rhino, Electro and other foes. Moves are context-sensitive based on the distance between your character and the opponent. Energy bars decrease as you each take hits. After each section you get comic-book sequences as a reward, and to set the scene of the evolving story.</resource>

In Dr. Fruit the player takes the role of Dr. Falken who was transformed into a strawberry. Now he has to dig trough his garden in this Mr. Do! variant.

A level consists of dirt, free places (normally arranged to ways) and fruits. To reach the next level, Dr. Falken needs to pick up all fruit. If can't (or doesn't want to) use the existing ways to reach them, he digs new ways into the dirt. However, there are also enemies lurking on the field which are restricted to the free ways. An enemy can be disposed of by shooting him or by digging away the dirt under a rock so it falls on his head.

Dr. Fruit is rubbish to play, avoid.</resource>

This leads to six levels of horizontally-scrolling shoot ‘em up action, although with some vertical movement as well.

The thing which sets the game apart from every other horizontally-scrolling shoot ‘em up (except Saint Dragon) is that you are riding on the back of a dragon, called Bahamoot. Both you and the dragon have firepower, and holding down the fire button increases Bahamoot’s energy bolt’s ferocity. The dragon’s tail can be controlled indirectly, and because it is indestructible, it can be used either as a shield, or as a weapon in its own right. 

There are power-ups to collect by dismounting from the dragon and walking into them. These include fiery breath, bolts shot from Bahamoot’s tail, homing missiles of sorts, and lightning bolts, with only one ever active at a time. Each level has a time limit.

The artifacts can only be dropped at the correct location.

Of course there are enemies which try to stop the player and can be destroyed by using the dragon's fire breath. Besides the artifact collecting, the game plays out as a traditional multi-directional scrolling shooter. There are five levels with eight artifacts each.</resource>

Players fly around and destroy everything in their path. Much like in Xevious, action takes place on two planes, both in the sky (where the dragon is flying) and on the ground. The dragon has two different kind of attacks: fire that shoots up the screen, and fire that drops to hit a place on the ground in front of the dragon. Enemies exist both in the air and on the ground, and some can fly up from the ground to the sky.

Players can pick up power-ups, or upgrades, that will help them in their fight. Upgrades can include extra heads on the dragon, health, faster shots, and more. At the end of each stage is a boss that needs to be defeated. Having good upgrades that are not lost from being hit before reaching the bosses will help.</resource>

    <resource id="c1c7b5ec25275097fe289fed4d8373b9d8c1a7ef" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Dragon Tiles is a Puzzle game, developed by S.J. Smith and published by CLR Licenceware, which was released in Europe in 1996.

A variant on Shanghai, the ancient Chinese tile game, released when the official Amiga version was long unavailable.

A number of different types of tile are used, with 4 of each. These are arranged in a particular way, with some on top of others and some next to them. The idea is to remove pairs of tiles progressively so as to leave none remaining. However, a tile can only be moved if it has nothing on top of it, and has free space to either the left or right of it.

This version has 18 different tile layouts, and the tiles have modern pictures on them, ranging from Ghostbusters and Batman logos to computer chips and patterns of atoms, which makes the tiles more distinct and colourful, and takes the game out of its old-fashioned context.</resource>

The objective of the game is to remove tiles from a stack by matching tiles with the same emblem. Only tiles that have an empty place at either their left or right side can be removed. The main difference from the original game is that it's not only possible to remove two tiles at a time but also sets of four, six or eight tiles. The more tiles that are removed at a time the more points will the player earn. Another difference from the first game is that the play field is larger than the screen size which means that the display scrolls when the mouse cursor is moved.

The game consists of 75 levels and space for 25 more that can be created with a built-in level editor. The appearance of the game can be customized with different tile types: crystal, stone, wood and copper. There are also different emblem sets to choose from: the ones from the original game, as well as flags, runes, Chinese symbols and cards.</resource>

There is no character creation and the player is immediately put in control of the four protagonists as a party. Overworld travel and town navigation are displayed from a top-down perspective; house interiors are not shown graphically. Dungeons, on the other hand, are done in first-person pseudo-3D style, similarly to Dungeon Master. Game progression is non-linear, with the player able to travel to most locations from the onset.

Monsters are sometimes encountered wandering the wilderness, and are also found at fixed locations in the dungeons. When combat initiates, the game switches to a side-scrolling view with a grid displayed above it. The player can move characters over the battle field, attack with melee or ranged weapons, and cast spells, all in a turn-based fashion. Experience points are awarded for vanquishing monsters. Characters can also learn magic by mixing reagents and choosing between the Black and the White schools. The game can be saved at any time on the overworld. There is no auto-mapping feature.</resource>

    <resource id="25c1d122648ec8ca00ccf55aabeebee97f523d28" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Ryan, a bartender from a dystopian future can't sleep peacefully for months. His nights are sequences of nightmares and strange dreams, days with frequent black-outs with strange visions, until one night a figure in monk attire appears to him, and tells him the story of the seven evil ones, uniting to destroy to Dreamweb, the only barrier between the world and darkness. The monk makes a proposition: Ryan becomes the deliverer: the one who would keep the Dreamweb safe by killing those who try to destroy it.

Descending into paranoia and just wanting dreams to stop, Ryan accepts the mission, then wakes up in a puddle of cold sweat, next to his beloved girlfriend in her house, and late for work. Again.

DreamWeb is a top-down adventure game set in a gritty futuristic/dystopian city. Each location takes only a small portion of the screen without panning (except an optional small zoom window in the corner that follows the cursor), with the player interacting with objects and people by simply clicking them. Ryan has a limited inventory space, and as a lot of objects can be picked up (many without any use), the player must rationalize what might be useful and just filler. Dialogue is straight forward, with no options, but still required to advance in the game (to find new locations, for instance). In situations where many adventure games often feature an indirect approach to solve a  problem, Ryan often faces himself with situations where it's &amp;quot;killed or be killed&amp;quot;, which result in deaths  (sometimes of innocents).

The story isn't much developed inside the game, but the original release of the game included Diary Of a (Mad?) Man, a 40-page diary telling the descent of Ryan into madness, or his destiny, written by Stephen Marley provides a complete background to the events leading to the start of the game.

The interaction is performed either by typing text commands or by selecting verbs bound to function keys. Among those verbs are traditional &amp;quot;Look&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Talk&amp;quot;, as well as the more unorthodox commands such as &amp;quot;Buy&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Hit&amp;quot;.</resource>

The aim of the game is shown in the introduction. Flintheart Glomgold challenges Scrooge to a competition to see who the richest duck in the world is. They each have 30 days to see who can get the most money together and finally their dispute will be settled.

Scrooge's office is your headquarters. Here you have three options ? you can go exploring for treasure, play the stock market or dive into your money bin, occasionally finding a rare coin which adds to you treasure total. You need to get some money first before you can play the stock market though.

You main source of income comes from the exploration map which hangs on the wall. From here, you can pick a destination, which you can travel to. There are four different scenarios when travelling to various parts of the world. It's these levels that are the most fun. You can choose to go mountain climbing, jungle bashing, search a cavern, or photograph some rare animals depending on your location. On screen information tells you which scenario it is, how long the trip will take and how much the treasure is worth. There's also an island in the Indian Ocean you can visit to check on who's winning between you and Glomgold.

You have to fly to each location and your transport is LaunchPad McQuack! You have to take off at the airport and fly to the destination. There are obstacles along the way though, watch out for powerlines (these are really funny, you run into them and boing! bounce back); hot air balloons dropping refrigerators, anvils, 10 ton weights and pianos; cumulo nimbus clouds shooting lightening and fluffly clouds; whales blowing water out their spouts; tall mountains, rocky outcrops, fireworks, hay barns among other things. Landing on the other side requires a special skill ? Launchpads! You have to crash into the airport to land! Crash the plane though and it takes two days of your valuable time limit for Gyro Gearloose to fix it.

Using Huey, Dewey and Louie, each being one of your three lives in the mountain climbing level, you must get from the base of the mountain to the top to get your treasure. Using the boys, you can hop from ledge to ledge, or when the going gets tough, use your grappling hook! This is a lot of fun and requires precision. There are also caves in the side of the mountain, which can transport you up or down the mountain. But watch out for bears in the caves. Other obstacles include falling rocks, the Beagle Boys dropping objects from above, mountain goats, Magica de Spell and more.

The jungle features Scrooges' nephews again. Here you must use swinging vines, branches and even hippopotamus' backs to get to the treasure. Sleeping pumas, snakes, macaws and monkeys hamper you progress.

Searching a cavern involves Scrooge, his nephews and niece, navigating a maze using the map at the bottom of the screen to get to the treasure whilst avoiding the yeti tracking them down.

Photography, with Webbigail, Scrooge's niece, involves her taking snaps of rare animals in a forest. Some animals get you more money for your snaps than others.

Once the thirty day marker is reached, whoever has the most gold between Scrooge and Glomgold is the winner.</resource>

Put them together and you get a game all about digging tunnels and trying to destroy nasty aliens by dropping bricks on them or inflating them until they burst. And thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s it.
Blows yer mind, eh?

    <resource id="588df5b538834acf490f4b1c307ba69616f87fa4" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Based on the legendary Frank Herbert novel of the same name and visually inspired by the 1984 David Lynch movie, Dune is a strategy-adventure hybrid where the player takes the role of young Paul Atreides, the son of Duke Leto. The Emperor Shaddam Corrino IV has given the Atreides House the rights to manage the extraction of the most precious substance in the entire universe - the Melange, commonly known as Spice in the desolate desert planet Arrakis (Dune), the only place in the universe capable of producing the substance. While everything indicates the offer is a trap orchestrated by their enemies the Harkonnen, the Atreides family agrees on moving, as he who controls the spice, controls the universe.

The player arrives in Arrakis with the mission of contacting and convincing the Fremen tribes residing in sietches (desert settlements) near the Atreides palace to harvest the spice. Harvesting is the most important part of the game, required to purchase equipment from the smugglers and appease the emperor. To speed up the process of harvesting, the player can equip the tribes with harvesters to increase production and ornis to protect them from the gigantic protectors of the planet: Shai-Hulud - the sandworms. 

However, the spice doesn't last forever and new sietches must be prospected before having a mining crew assigned, but the player cannot run Southwards forever, as the Harkonnen enemy controls the North of the Planet, dangerously close to the Atreides Palace. Soon after the initial batches are sent to the Emperor, the player will have to actively deal with the Harkonnen, who will try to take control of player Sietches. For those, Fremen tribes can be assigned to military training with Gurney Halleck, but before doing such work Paul must have a certain reputation, gained by the control of Arrakis.

As the game advances, the player will untap Paul's latent powers, as well as meeting other characters from the Dune universe, such as Duke Leto, Jessica, Thufir Hawat, Duncan Idaho, Harah, Chani, Stilgar and Liet Kynes, the mastermind behind the ecological plans on Dune - the ultimate goal.

    <resource id="d388047935bd8f1606487e1ca4811e88263cbf0f" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Dune II is often considered the first mainstream modern real-time strategy game and established many conventions of the genre. Even though set in Frank Herbert's famous Dune universe, the game is only loosely connected to the plot of any of the books or the films based from them. Controlling either of the three Houses, the player must fight a number of battles against the other Houses. In the early levels, the goal is simply to earn a certain number of credits, while in the later missions, all enemies must be destroyed.

The single resource in the game is the Spice, which must be collected by harvesters. The spice is converted to credits in a refinery, which are then spent to construct additional buildings and units. There are two terrain types: buildings can only be constructed on stone, while the Spice is only found on sand. However, units moving on sand attract the large sandworms of Dune, who are virtually indestructible and can swallow even large units whole. As levels progress, new and more advanced buildings and units are made available, including structures like a radar station, a repair facility or defense turrets and, for units, various ground troops, light vehicles and tanks. Each House can construct one unique special unit, and, after building a palace improvement, can unleash a unique palace effect.</resource>

You move your gun left and right in order to hit the targets, and you earn more scores for hitting those on the higher rows. You have a limited amount of bullets, but hitting the numbered boxes add more to your arsenal. While the rabbits and owls require just one hit, the ducks will change colours several times before being eliminated. When only five targets remain, the screen changes colour and they must be hit before they leave the screen forever. As you progress, the speed is elevated.</resource>

After the nightmare Dylan saw in his dream, he received the invitation from one mysterious person to visit a mansion along with many other people. Accepting the invitation, Dylan (clothed in his signature red shirt, black jacket, and blue jeans) entered the house and took part in the sumptuous feast. But the wine was poisoned, and the part of guests were the murderers. Dylan, remembering the nightmare, just in case took the revolver with him. And here it all starts...

You as Dylan should move around the house, fight with the murderers with bare hands, with revolver, or with weapons found in the house such as knife, screwdriver, sword, or maul. You should find certain keys to open certain doors. Also after killing certain murderers, you'll be provided with certain secrets given to you by the survived guests. Main parts of the story is told in comics art-style without any literary material.

The problems for you in the mansion along the murderers are:
1) the timeflow, so you should act quickly;

Does that sound like a job for a retired superhero? Captain Dynamo thinks so, and aims to recapture them for their rightful owner.

Gameplay is platform-based, with 12 vertically-scrolling levels, each containing around 50 diamonds - the more of these you can collect, the higher your score. Some will require advance planning to reach, while you will often be dependent on booster pads to reach the higher sections of a level.

The player adopts the identity of an ancient Chinese warrior, and riding on horseback has to eliminate all his opponents, mostly infantry and archers. 

Four historical characters from the time period can be controlled: Zhang Fei (fights with a halberd), Liu Bei (broadsword), Guan Yu (a Chinese pole weapon known as guan dao), and Zhao Yun (pike); some of the character names are misspelled in translated versions. The characters are distinguished by their health and strength parameters.

The game uses a lateral scroll and the player can move in all four directions. A novelty is the attack system: when pressing fire the energy of the attack will load up as the warrior moves his weapon up and backwards, in order to gain momentum. The more the player can keep fire pressed, the more powerful the attack will be. In addition, so-called &amp;quot;tactics&amp;quot; can be used at specific moments; these are powerful area attacks that deplete the protagonist's HP in process and range from summoning an ambush partner and causing rocks slide down slopes.</resource>

Another twist is that the chopper carries a small tank for land-based battle plus an amphibious craft for aquatic attacks. Destroy all the robot enemies specified by the radar and you can exit this landscape to the next. And that's about yet lot.</resource>

At last the Amiga can boast a game you will be proud to boot up when your crystal analyst comes round to listen to your collection of Brian Eno LPs. The Game of Harmony is one of those games in which gameplay is everything - The Game of Harmony is very much back to basics.

Asteroids type manner, you have to knock pairs of matching balls together to make them disappear. If, however, you send different coloured spheres careering into each other, you have to get rid of. As game-plays go, it requires dexterity, subtlety and restraint, so if your idea of a good time is a few rounds of Rambo III, it is quite likely that this is not the game for you. Frankly, The Game of Harmony can be bloody irritating, you can be just about to complete a difficult manoeuvre and a little misjudgement or slip of the joystick can give you twice as much work as you started with. Then again, it is also highly addictive. The Game of Harmony is that rarest of games Ã¢â‚¬â€œ an original.

After a few hours of dabbing with the game, I got the feeling that although The Game of Harmony is original, stylish and highly playable, there is something about it that makes it fall short of being a true classic. It could be that it is a little fussy for my tastes, dare I say a little poncy. I am just not sure that the aggro involved in getting through the game is worth it. All I can be sure of is that after reviewing it, I have an irresistible urge to reach for a Napalm Death tape and give the volume control a severe yank.</resource>

On each stage you have to avoid the asteroids, collect energy cells, shoot the spaceships attacking you, and contact space stations (Alcor, Torius, Casiope, etc.). Finishing the stages you interrogate with space station's inhabitants to take an additional information (true or false) to find finally the coordinates of the Cyborgs' mother planet.

In contrast to the complexities of their excellent Faery Tale Adventure, Microillusions have now come up with a game of surprising simplicity.

Ebonstar takes elements from a few ancient coin-ops and with a neat vector graphic effect, results in a game rather like those oldies Space Wars and Stella Castle. A single static grid is the playfield throughout the game. Moving at random around the grid is a kind of black hole that swallows up everything in its range. The object is to destroy the void by shooting a bolt of energy straight down the maintenance beam projected by the constantly circling Arch. Up to four players can be on the grid at one time. The playersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ aims are twofold: to destroy the hole and also to force each other into its lifeless depths.

Each player controls a ship armed with an energy bolt cannon. These repel other ships on impact, and so can be used to push other players around. From the Arch, drone ships and a few other aliens are launched as well as a few extra weapons that can be caught by the players.

Simple games can often be some of the best games, but this is not really the case with Ebonstar. The void moves around with absolutely mesmerising smoothness appearing frightingly how one would imagine a real black hole to be. The explosion has been very well done, too but Ebonstar plays at far too slow a pace with too little action to create the level of excitement it attempts. Its music, sound effects and most of its graphics are incredibly simple, which coupled with the tedious gameplay and high asking price make this a bit of a non-starter.

Inside Ebonstar is a great and fascinating game dying to come out Ã¢â‚¬â€ unfortunately the black hole seems to have sucked away MicroillusionsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ usual brilliance.</resource>

The initial tasks are to roam around finding food and then find a potential mate. Depending on the organism's status, different predators will be after it - a radar is displayed to indicate where these are at any given time. Once this is done, the player is taken to a screen displaying the species' genes, and has the chance to modify one of them, thus resulting in evolution. Eventually the organism can evolve far enough to become plant, insect, fish, or even human.</resource>

The game contains real player and team names.

Eishockey Manager allows the player to handle most of the relevant aspects of a hockey team, both economic- and sport-wise. He can trade players, organize the training, handle the team's line-ups and tactics, negotiate contracts with players and sponsors, and expand the team's stadium.

Your team's games can either be watched in a ticker-like text display only, or with animated, prerendered, goal-scenes.

Up to four players can play simultaneously in hot-seat mode.

As opposed to Software 2000's six game soccer manager series, Eishockey Manager remained the only hockey manager ever released by this publisher. Technically Eishockey Manager represents a step between Bundesliga Manager Professional (1991) and Bundesliga Manager Hattrick (1995).</resource>

Elf is a platform game which almost crosses into the adventure genre. You play an elf who is out to destroy Necrilous the Not-Very-Nice. It's resonably non-linear areas in that you can go back and forth between areas.

You collect items during play and get access to different spells and attacks.</resource>

Some parts of the track are blocked unless you can shoot through obstacles before reaching them, or hit a jump pad. At some points you can change to travelling along the ceiling as well.

The changes have been made by AmiGer under the CARE project . Elite puts you in a role of starship commander (a small starship). You can choose to be whatever you want - a trader, mercenary, pirate, all of the above! Trade goods and earn money slowly or seek and destroy other ships. As you earn ranks, you'll be offered some missions to finally reach the ultimate rank - ELITE. Very hard and very entertaining.

Modifications are: new ships, Warrior MkIV and Colubrid II. New equipment: Climatech Universal Laser Cooler and M2031A3 Heavy Military Laser. Some visual adjustments are made e.g. planet colours in space now fit to colours in local navigation chart, etc. Equipment is now splitted into two pages if more then 15 equipments are available. Rating point table halved, so you reach the E-L-I-T-E status and the missions earlier.</resource>

Embryo is a 3D shooter by a Croatian development team, with an excellent 3D engine! The 3D world is not very detailed but very fast giving a true sense of speed, with some nice effects like bullets hitting the ground. The 2D graphics, still images and especially the original cockpit design, are also outstanding.

I have two problems with Embryo, though. One, as has also been noted in many contemporary magazine reviews, is that it takes forever to bring even a single enemy down. The enemy helicopter, gun turrets etc simply take way too many hits before being destroyed. Two, the gameplay is too simple even for a 3D shooter. All you can do is fly around and kill enemies, in very simple missions. Earlier games like Starglider II or Interphase have shown how far you can take the gameplay for this kind of game, but the much later Embryo has gameplay that feels straight out of the early 80s.

Still, there's a lot to like about Embryo and if you like fast 3D on a standard Amiga with plenty of hard action, this one is worth to check out.</resource>

Emerald Mine holds your interest even after the novelty has worn off. It is not unusual in that it is a series of puzzles you must solve in sequence but this game, however, contains over 100 levels! The levels are often difficult to master: you must learn the rules of each, maneuver around obstacles, and avoid the merciless creatures.

In each level, your objective is to gather all the emeralds in the allotted time. Besides emeralds, you will find: diamonds, which carry three times the point value of emeralds; rocks, which you can topple onto creatures; explosives; keys to linked rooms; wheels that attract enemy bugs and more. Emerald Mine is fast paced, but il doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t requite the reflexes of Superman. One or two people can play: two-player mode lets you and a friend play simultaneously as a team. The game saves 30 high scores for each level on the copy protected disk.

A smooth-scrolling view screen displays part of the large playing area. The sound effects add to the game without distracting you, and the graphics are adequate.

IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m addicted. My children love Emerald Mine. Even my jaded friends are hooked. If you want a game you will not quickly tire of, dig in!</resource>

Before each match your team can choose special moves to assign to each player - power shots with ludicrous curve, super dribbling (making the ball stick to your foot), and a Barge power to push players out of the way. A full world cup tournament is offered, which up to 8 human players can partake in, as well as single exhibition matches. The action replays feature a VCR-style control.</resource>

While it shares many of the earlier game's characteristics, somehow it doesn't come off quite as well...

The Empire Strikes Back has four levels. The first has you blasting away at Imperial Probe Droids and their transmissions as you try to stop them notifying the Empire. The second level has you trying to bring down Imperial walkers, either by
shooting them through the view slits, or by casting tow cables at their legs. The third level is eerily reminiscent of the first level of Star Wars: shoot TIE fighters and their fireballs. The final level is just annoying. You steer through an asteroid field.

The game as a whole includes many classic sound effects and samples from the movie, but as a whole it lacks the appeal of the earlier game.</resource>

But as it is in video games, an evil wizard stops by and takes over. In this case, he broke the heart of wisdom and the only way to bring the story to a good end is to collect the pieces from the five levels of this game. The protagonist is the magician Kurgan who jumps through the multi-directional scrolling platform levels.

A big boss stands at the end of each level, but defeating him is not enough to get access to the next: the hidden parts of the heart need to be found first. Besides platforming, there are are lot of enemies to fight. To do so, the magician has twelve weapons at his disposal which need a certain amount of energy to use. Just like the other two bars (jumping and life energy) it can be refilled by collecting crystals.</resource>

    <resource id="beb06745c778d81ccc42626e81abde3a188a93ef" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Amiga Encounter is a Shooter game, developed and published by Novagen, which was released in 1991.

Blimey, this takes me back a bit! One ot the first games I ever had on my trusty but now deceased C64. Encounter was also the first game to appear from the Howard Hughes of the programming world.

Encounter is basically an extension of the age-old Battlezone scenario, and when it was originally released, was praised for its (then) stunning fast filled graphics - and the lack of glitch associated with the genre. Unfortunately, what you considered hot and stunning in the old days now looks decidedly dated.

The basic idea of the game is to patrol an oddly-coloured desert and take out the enemy space-ships and missiles before they get to you. However, punctuating the barren landscape are a series of metallic columns, and these can be used to deflect shots and to hide behind. And thatâ€™s it.

Although this may sound a little damning, thereâ€™s no doubt that Encounter is a playable little blast. The graphics, whilst not pushing back any barriers, are smoothly updated and the enemy ships are fast and deadly. The trouble is that there just isnâ€™t enough to do, and when you consider that Novagen are asking twenty-odd quid for it, I donâ€™t think that pure nostalgia offers enough for your money.</resource>

A seemingly abandoned space ship was the goal of a research team. Unfortunately aliens were still there and assaulted the humans. Now the player's mission is to purge all 34 floors. There is a fix set of objectives which have to be completed within a time limit, e.g. rescuing survivors, destroying alien eggs, finding weapons or killing aliens. Some of the objectives are not at the same place in each playthrough.

The defying feature of this game is variety in gameplay and objectives. It introduces more gameplay elements as it goes on and the player has to solve sections which rely on quick action, solving puzzles or both. Besides the expected movement options, the player character also has some more exotic moves like double jumps and walking backwards while shooting; equipment includes a variety of weapons, e.g. grenades or a silencer, and tools like a automap illustrator (complete maps can be found on computer terminals) or a movement sensor. During the course of the game the player may have temporary assistance by AI controlled characters. The game also features an optional help system which blends in symbols representing the next course of action, e.g. a light bulb means that there is a puzzle to solve and a white flag means the level is in an unwinnable state.</resource>

With its 1991 release, English Championship Special is somewhat awkwardly set in between the 1990 World Cup (England made the semi finals, its best result since 1966, then lost to Germany and to Italy in the third-place match) and the European Championship of 1992, to which the &amp;quot;Championship Special&amp;quot; part of the title refers. The squad composition is based on the 1991 status quo, which means you'll go into the Euro tournament with World Cup veterans such as Waddle, Beardsley and Wright, but without 1992 players like Alan Shearer or Alan Smith, infamous substitute to Gary Lineker in the Sweden match.</resource>

The gameplay uses a forced perspective top-down view, and strongly resembles Gauntlet in the way Hasrinaxx moves, shoots, avoids enemies and collects health items. 

Matters are more complex in terms of the spell system however. 32 spells can be collected and used, including a fireshield to allow you to pass fiery areas, water and fire walls to attack immediate enemies, a deathlight to clear the area of enemies, and a teleport. You can also summon one of 4 Elemental beings, who can be controlled simultaneously to attack creatures for you. Only 8 spells can be carried at a time, but you can drop and later re-collect them.</resource>

Collected jewels can be used in shops to acquire extra weapons, shields and lives. In each world there are also two secret rooms where Erik can get extra lives and weapons that are not available in the shops.</resource>

Operation Snowball is similar to the arcade game Cabal insofar as it resembles Operation Wolf but adds a roll manoeuvre. You must fire snowballs at people who are trying to make a catapult, and destroy the shots they aim at you.

Eggsterminator places you at the top of a cliff, which has 5 ledges containing a birdÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s nest. Birds will periodically land on these and lay eggs, which you must collect. Contact with the birds themselves causes you to fall and lose time. Ice NÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Igloos involves using your axe to collect ice, and taking it to your incomplete igloo to complete it. Avoid the seals, as contact with these costs you time.

Miami Ice is a clone of Tapper, except that instead of beer you are serving ice cream to people. From one side of the screen you must ensure that each line has enough ice creams sent down it to match the number of people coming. Also ensure that you are ready to collect the empty cones when these are returned. Evidently, the taste of wafers is not popular near the poles.

The final event is not present on the C64. It is Barbearian, a one-on-one fight with a polar bear. The ice melting away sets the time limit in this game.</resource>

The sports simulation boasts an impressive variety of diciplines, divided into three sections:

Track and Field: running, relay, hurdles, steeplechase, discus, shot putt, hammer throw, javelin, long jump, triple jump, high jump, pole vault;nnWater Sports: free style, breast stroke, back stroke, butterfly, relay, diving;nnFighting: boxing, wrestling, judo, fencing.

Eliminating the different distances in single events (such as 100m, 200m, 400m and 800m freestyle), though, The Games' &amp;quot;over 30 events&amp;quot; melt down to 22; and counting only those which differ to some degree in their execution, it boils down to six: running, throwing, jumping, swimming, diving and fighting.

The Games '92 is divided in three parts: During preparation time, manage and train twelve athletes by sentencing them to gym time and daily practice. Game time advances with each action until the olympic games begin.
In pactice, heats and finals, you take control of your athletes and drive them to peak performances through rhythmical tapping of the cursor keys, and the occasional press of the space bar.
In the database section, you can read up on previous games and winning athletes, and take a look at Barcelona location maps.</resource>

It's often a case of Ã¢â‚¬Ëœpress the button and gamble away' with regards to passing, as the ball always travels to the nearest player you're facing, not matter how far away he is. One moment it'll travel about half a metre and the next it'll be right up the other end of the pitch. 'Playability' is obviously a word that isn't in Flair's dictionary. The players are uncontrollably slow and they often perform a number of stupid automatic moves, like chesting the ball away if it arrives at shoulder height, which is worrying. Computer controlled players have a disturbing habit of running away from the ball whenever it nears them, making the defence look like stupid and they generally act with little intelligence. Aftertouch, diving headers and bicycle kicks are about as existent as Macaulay Culkin's talent - the entire match consists of milling about, attempting a few 'graphically-challenged' sliding tackles and running with the ball as if it's nailed to your athlete's foot. Even the crowd sound as if they're embarrassed to be in a game this bad - all they seem to be able to muster up is a monotone &amp;quot;Uuuuuuurh!&amp;quot; all the bloody time.</resource>

The game scrolls horizontally at a slight angle, and recreates the coin-op's close-up zoom effect after a player scores. Only a small area of the pitch is on screen at a time, but there is a scanner to show the whole pitch.

Although the game has a referee, he often loses attention, and these moments give you a chance to foul, punch or side-swipe opposition players. One and two player options are included.</resource>

This classic dungeon crawler was made by Croatian developers Olympia Entertainment Group. The game have never been commercially released because lots of bugs, but has been repaired French Amiga programmer -meynaf- and release as freeware. The Evil's Doom is a chronicle of warrior Vantan. The chronicler will be telling the story while you will help him to complete the tale with your gameplay. At the beginning of the game your island map will show only a few location but as you will go further many new locaitons will appear and many new facts and options will be placed in the interfaces. Once in the dungeons, you need to plan your tactics carefully because many dungeon habitants will try to stop you as an intruder in their home. Here you will use all the weapons and stuff you bought or found at villages or in town. Selecting the right weapons and tactics may save your head in battles and since Vantan is the main character, if youlose him the game will end immediately.</resource>

The enemies are in many types, shapes and colours - spaceships, 'molecules', geometric figures, etc. If a spaceship flies too slowly, then it has a tendency to fall down.

This game is as original as Thrust, Gravitar, Choplifter and Olds. Prettier, perhaps, with some extra bells and whistles but essentially the same. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s absolutely nothing wrong with taking a great idea, improving and developing It. But with this game itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hard to see where the improvements have been carried out. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sad, especially when you look at some of the other games recently released, such as Utopia, Megalomania and Magic Pockets. All three have taken a tried and trusted game formula and pushed it one step further by enhancing the gameplay, and adding something fresh and exciting.

There are really too many better games to buy with your money. Sorry, but thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no way this Executioner is a killer.</resource>

    <resource id="7a0de2ed24b593b505a9b9e38aa047329336deae" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">The screen display in Extase depicts a symmetrical network of wires, some buttons, some fuses, some switches, and a picture of a female android in the middle. The overall aim is to restore sensory functions to the android, one in each level. All of this is done against an opponent, either human or computer, who controls the opposite half of the board.

This is done by guiding electrical pulses through each of the wires, however this can only be done once the wires have been woken up. You are in control of a cursor, which can click on the activation buttons to release a ball, which you direct using the cursor to reactivate wires on its path. Switches must be set to make all parts of this available – this can only be done when no ball is active.

Electrical sparks move around to make life harder, by destroying balls and fuses. Fortunately these can be 'zapped' using the cursor. New fuses can be generated by guiding a power beam into the fusebox, which is located centrally – simply pick up and place a generated fuse.

Better still, you can steal your opponent's, which is one of many ways the game becomes directly competitive. The two cursors cannot occupy the same space on screen, so hitting your opponent's cursor will jolt it. You can also adjust switches on both sides of the board, and summon sparks for your opponent to deal with. As the android is reactivated during the level it shows a range of facial expressions as a visual reward and measure of your progress.

The game is played with two to four players on a board with differently coloured squares. Each player has playing stones of one colour and the goal to get a certain amount of the own stones on the corresponding fields. The spin on this concept is that the board is placed on two rotatable spirals which change the square distribution on the field when used. During each turn, a player has a different amount of moves available (changes depending on the current match situation); each move consisting of moving a square or turning a spiral. This computer version also allows some rule modifications in comparison to the original game and all opponents can be replaced by the AI.

There are two modes of play available: &amp;quot;Arcade&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Grand Prix&amp;quot;. In both of these modes you complete a certain number of laps (4, 8, or 12) and select which circuit that you want to race on. The circuits include San Marino, France, Britain, Germany, Italy, Portugal, Japan, and Australia. Some circuits are easy, while some are difficult. 

There are slight differences between the two modes. For instance, &amp;quot;Arcade&amp;quot; allows you to select the circuit in any order that you like, whereas &amp;quot;Grand Prix&amp;quot; only allows you to fine-tune your car before starting a race. You also need to race a circuit in the order that they appear on the circuit selection screen, but you can skip a track if you want. 

F1 is a 1-2 player game, meaning that if you have another player handy, you can compete against each other.</resource>

The aircraft moves forward by itself and the player's control is limited to steering, climbing, diving and shooting. When an enemy appears within the player's view the head on computer automatically locates it and locks on target and the player simply has to press the fire button to shoot it down. In additional to the primary machine gun attack there is also a missile attack that is initiated by holding down the fire button. Enemies includes most commonly aircrafts but also ground targets such as installations, tanks and gun emplacements. While playing it's necessary to keep track of the plane's damage and fuel levels. At times collectibles will appear and picking these up will recharge some of the fuel or repair some of the damage.</resource>

The televisual presentation, one of the unique points of the early EA Sports titles, with hosts introducing the matches, was another thing making the game stand out from a market dominated by Sensible Soccer and Kick Off games.

Based on international teams (with fictional player names), their abilities in each skill area rated out of 10 to give the player an overall impression of how good they are. The options available follow the standard set: fouls and offsides can be toggled on and off, the match length can be set, and if the timer operates  continuously, or only while the ball is in play. Gameplay privileges quick runs, short passes and blistering shots outside the penalty box, and set pieces are controlled by moving a box into the target area for the ball, and then passed, lobbed or kicked directly. On the tactical side, formations can be selected, with 5 different strategies also available (although not all of these combinations make sense) as can the team Coverage - the areas which defenders, midfielders and strikers cover.

Each of the three has his own strengths: Julian is the archetypal melee fighter, Philip has high luck and intelligence, while Kevin is known for his kindness. Should the player fail while controlling one of the brothers, the next one will replace him. Each brother will be revived a few times when vanquished by an enemy, until his luck runs out, at which point he will die permanently.</resource>

The most technically-advanced of Dizzy's adventure games in many ways, it was the only one to feature actual scrolling rather than a flick-screen system, the only one not to be released for the 8 bit computers the character originated on, the only one to originate on a console, as well as featuring many mini-games, such as Bubble Dizzy and an Operation Wolf clone.

Gameplay involves walking Dizzy through the levels, picking up objects and using them to solve simple puzzles. There are plenty of tests of arcade skill along the way as well, as gaps must be jumped and baddies avoided - starting with a limited number of lives, the player can earn more by completing Theodore's puzzle. Before rescuing Daisy the player must capture all stars that unlock the gates of the tower.</resource>

Reputedly one of the greatest rivalries since the invention of the basketball itself, the Slammers and the Jammers are at it again. This time itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s two teams of six taking part in a three-on-three contest.

You compete with a friend or a computer opponent, and before the match starts a few tactical decisions have to be made: the length of the quarters (3 to 12 minutes) and exactly which members of the squad are going to play. A quick resume of each playerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s strengths and weaknesses helps you decide.

The court is viewed as two awkward flick-screen halves. As a result any action in the centre of the court inevitably becomes confused. Ball moves include dribbling, passing, shooting and opportunities for calling offensive and defensive plays. There are two kinds of personal foul and no free throws. Unusually, you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t automatically control the player nearest the ball; switching between players manually tends to slow the action down.

On paper it all sounds pretty sophisticated. On court, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a disappointment. The sprites are poorly defined and jerkily animated, playÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s spoilt by the flick-screen action and there isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t that much skill required. It only takes a couple of minutes to get used to the shooting controls and after that almost every basket you attempt goes in.

If youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve always dreamed of hurling yourself up the court in a pair of Lycra shorts, dribble driving, no-look passing and slam-dunking your way into basketball history, keep on dreaming. Accolade has built up a reputation for producing top class sports Sims. This isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t one of them.</resource>

It has nine tracks, including Horama, Le Mans, Suzuka and Donnington. There is a practice mode in which you can get used to the gears, which can also be set to auto transmission. Many options on the car can be tweaked, for example the angle of the front and rear spoilers, the tires and more. A detailed damage model can be shown and also fuel settings can be changed (you can reduce the amount of fuel in the tank).

Before a race you have to qualify by getting a good time during three rounds on the empty racing track. Depending on the qualifying time you start in the field. The graphics are displayed with zooming sprites, and the track is not flat, but features some hills that limit the view of the further road. Despite the car options, this game is not a real simulation but plays like an arcade racer.</resource>

    <resource id="e9ce466033e55ad15b796191c224a0705b34c2ff" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">One night, when Roy Fat was home, thugs from the evil Thindicate corporation kidnap Roy's old lady while she watches television, and the only way that Roy is going to get her back is to trade her for the Duplicator, and the complete documentation that came with it.

There are seven stages to the game, and there are three levels each in the first stage, only two in the rest. The object of the game is to eat all the food that there is in the level. Once all food is eaten by Roy, a tone will sound, meaning that the gate that leads Roy into the next level will be open. Stopping him from doing this is insects and other wildlife, including rats, birds, bats, and many more. Roy is able to fix this, however, by using a variety of weapons like his foot, his fat tummy, carrots, mushroom bombs, and my personal favorite, his burp. He can also jump in the air and land on his ass to get rid of enemies.

If he touches an enemy, he loses one of his lives. If he loses all his lives, the game is over. Once Roy has collected all the food in a stage, he has to face a boss that is usually much bigger than him. Fatman can also pass flags, which lets him continue where he left off if he loses a life. Besides enemies, other hazards need to be looked out for, including spike, spikeballs, water, and fire.</resource>

Fears took the approach of having full-screen, though relatively low-resolution, graphics. The level landscapes feature lots of stairways and lifts, giving it a psuedo-3D feel. The game is played across 30 levels., with a level designer also included. The one-player game has 3 difficulty levels, while multi-player action is available via a null-modem cable.

The player is able to zoom around in space while trading goods, undertake missions, or simply explore the galaxy (which consists of over 8 million planets). 

There is a significant amount of playable options in FOFT and a considerable attention is paid to detail. For instance, if the player becomes tired of roaming through outer space they skim a planet or two (which plays in a similar fashion to David Braben's other game, Virus).

During the docking sequence players can create their own programs for automated functions, using a built-in BASIC like language called SIMPLE.</resource>

The rightful leaders of the country have called you in to destroy Fernandez's hideouts and bring his country back to the people.

Fundamentally this is a Commando clone, scrolling vertically and with hordes of enemies to be taken on, with finding good shielding spots and launching surprise attacks an especially useful strategy.You have unlimited bullets and limited but collectible grenades to use. There are landmines to avoid, and medical packs to pick up.

On each of the 8 levels you must destroy Fernandez's buildings, which are accessed through an underground network of tunnels. You're not limited to being on foot - you start off in a jeep and can also use motorbikes, tanks and similar, although losing a life destroys this. In 2-player mode you can split driving and gunning duties. When starting a new game, you always start from the point at which you died in the last game.

You can jump straight into the races however, either as one-offs or a full championship season. Races can last from 18km to the full 300+km distance, with all the practice and qualifying sessions. Car setup at the track involves selecting wing settings, tyre compounds, fuel usage (important in the days of turbocharged engines) and the like.

You can use a combination of the spells (including a teleporter, invisibility and a fireball, which you must work our how to use). Leanoric’s direction relative to yourself is indicated by a compass.

    <resource id="da79b9190f5a2b80964183dce47fc5f06e8941c9" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Reminding me very much of the old CRL game Legend, Feudal Lords is a relatively simple medieval strategy game, for one to four players, each playing a feudal lord. The play, which takes place on the restricted area of Euthrania, is divided into small sections. The winner is decided when one of the lords takes possession of all of the territories. You lose when your own home territory (the one containing your castle) is taken by another lord.

On the whole you might think that Feudal Lords offers an encouraging blend of strategy and tactics, but actual gameplay does not live up to the early promise. The trouble with this game is that it is too heavily weighted towards combat (the economics do not make a whole lot of difference) and the artificial intelligence is, on the other hand, unfair towards the player during one-player games. Three CPU lords will talk among themselves and one of the three will hits you with everything he has got.

The turn method is unfair too. Instead of the game allowing simultaneous orders to be fed into the play, you are treated to a random turn method. Hence you may be first to make a move on turn one, third to move on turn two, etc. When the position is critical this sort of potential to wreak havoc can be devastating - all because of the poorly designed game system!

The theories of combat integrated within the game are fictional and poorly managed. Far too much emphasis is placed upon the knight as the all-important power in the game and too little credit is given to the bowmen who are not, according to the manual, very useful in normal battle Ã¢â‚¬â€œ ever heard of Agincourt, Impressions?

Disappointing gameplay, poor game design, a shoddy manual, the game crushes when you loseÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ Need I go on?</resource>

You have a team of five players of which you control the one nearest to the ball. The idea of the game is to win an Olympic Gold Medal by beating your opponents in a knock-out tournament. You can use all the normal football skills: dribbling, shooting and heading but what makes Fighting Soccer different is that you can also foul your opponents. If you decide that an Olympic medal is worth a bit of foul play then you'd better watch out for the ever vigilant referee.

Because of the difficulty factor many people will give up after a few plays, real soccer fans with lots of perseverance may get some enjoyment from Fighting Soccer but I think that the repetitive nature of the game may even get to them after a while. If Activision hoped to net a winner with Fighting Soccer then this effort is well wide of the posts.</resource>

    <resource id="5086de031c01dec2ec8c721218ce8ffc54b5d11d" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Football Glory gets a makeover in this recreation of five-a-side football. The basic game engine is much the same, with identical menu systems and similar styling to the team selection (albeit with less players). Gameplay is similar to Sensible Soccer, with loose ball control (although there are 3 options for this), small playing sprites and an emphasis on ground passing, plus a few speech bubble comments when the ball goes dead.

Two distinct sets of 5-a-side rules are featured, English and International, with full explanations of the differences built into the game. There are seven different pitch surfaces, ranging form grass and Astroturf to concrete and plastic, as well as the option of playing without a fence keeping the ball constantly in play. Tournaments and friendlies can be played, using either club or international teams.</resource>

    <resource id="00f9637c3ec0e6a9c53cdfd7eb704dbafdbf4c5e" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Werner Flaschbier is a PD/Freeware Maze game, developed by Level Four and published by Alpha Flight, which was released in Europe in 1989.



The player takes control of big nosed Werner (a popular comic character in Germany) who struggles to retrieve beer bottles whilst avoiding falling boulders and getting stuck. The game plays similar to classic 2D platformers Boulder Dash and Mr.Do upon which Werner is based. The name of the game 'Flasch Bier' translates loosely to Bottle O' Beer.



Cheats:

On the title screen, hold down the RIGHT MOUSE BUTTON, LEFT MOUSE BUTTON, and press 'SPACE'. The game will start the 1st level and at the bottom of the screen the message TRAINER ACTIVE will appear. Push up on the joystick to select level and press fire to try the level.</resource>

The player is the pilot of a jet airliner and his task is to take of from an airport, climb over the mountains that surrounds it and then land safely on an airfield in the valleys below. The player only gets one chance as there is only enough fuel for one landing. The game is played from a first person perspective and the screen is split into two parts: a landscape view at the top and the instrument panel below. The instrument panel shows all the information that is needed such as altitude, speed and artificial horizon. The game can be played on six different skill levels. Each level adds more complexity to the task.</resource>

The gameplay is platform based, although you can move down platforms as well as up to the next one. There are lots of baddies (drawn in a cutesy style) who need shooting and offer rewards. the 7 levels are fairly short, relatively easy, and linear.

    <resource id="d4634bd14ad1e03ad897cf7f2cb15152f9cdcc6c" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">The Flintstones is a game based on the popular cartoon series The Flintstones by Hanna-Barbera Productions Inc.

It's weekend! Fred Flintstone thinks of only one thing: bowling  
with his friend and neighbor Barney.
Unfortunately, his wife Wilma got other plans for him. Fred has to paint the living room and Wilma is not going to help him with it. No, she goes shopping.
And if that's not enough, Wilma also tells Fred that his mother-in-law is coming over.

The Flintstones game is divided in four parts.

Part 1: Painting the walls of your living room.
To go to the bowling alley before it is closed Fred has to paint  the walls as quickly as possible. To paint the walls Fred uses the tail of a living squirrel. 
Pebbles tries to leap out her playpen and starts crawling around and starts scribbling on the walls. If Fred wants to put Pebbles back in the playpen then he has to drop the squirrel, that immediately starts wandering off. When Pebbles is back in the playpen Fred has to chase the squirrel and dip its tail in the paint again.

Part 2: Driving your car on the way to the bowling center.
Finally, when all walls are painted Fred can go to the bowling  
alley!
Fred has to drive to the bowling alley but unfortunately the roads are in a very bad condition. The road surface is dire and covered with rocks!
And if one of the wheels hit a bump it will break off the car and disappear into the distance.

Part 3: A bowling competition between Fred and Barney.
At the bowling alley the following bowling parameters can be set: the spin and speed of the ball and the starting position of the player.
Each turn gives two throws (except he gets a strike). A game  
takes ten turns. while a match takes three games.

Part 4: Saving Pebbles at a construction site.
On his way home Fred discovers that Pebbles has disappeared!  Don't let Wilma find that out!
Fred finds Pebbles at a construction site on top of some  
scaffolding. He has to climb the scaffolding to rescue her.
If Fred fails to rescue his daughter then Barney rescues her and Fred will be branded as a failure!

Unfortunately the planet has not exactly the biggest water resources of the universe and so they are sent to Earth to get some. In the vertically scrolling platform levels the player has to solve puzzles by collecting objects and using them at the right place respectively giving them to the right people. However, the water is not given directly, but there is a water drop which has to be caught by using the water catcher object. The goal of each level is to collect a certain amount of water within the time limit.

The player character can't die, but loses fruit when he falls too much of a distance. Fruit can be collected when wandering through the levels and are used between the six levels to buy traps which have different effects (and of course different prices), e.g. wasting a bit of time or reversing the controls. This is useful because the two Martians don't work together and try to beat each other's water score. There are also other items to collect which are not directly related to puzzle solving, like a spring for long jumps and objects which help against special hazards in the level. Collecting pills is a bit of a gamble because they can either add or subtract points on the water or fruit counter. The game uses a split-screen; one half for each Martian. In two-player games, the second Martian is controlled by player two.</resource>

In general the litter is not particularly hidden, it is just distributed around the level. Quiffy can climb on most walls and ceilings, and swim through water. He has energy which depletes upon touching dangerous objects, but can also die instantly when touching any of the few lethal objects. Although he can swim and has the appearance of an amphibious life-form, he can only breathe above water and will start to drown if he runs out of air.

In each level, you are followed by the ghost of your Aunt Matilda. She copies your movements exactly and starts off about 15 seconds behind you. However, she is very slightly faster than you and will eventually catch up with you. Touching the ghost will hurt Quiffy.

Most of the levels have taps in them, which pour water in to the level. The modelling of the water was quite advanced for a home computer game of its time; the water will flow to the lowest point that it can and when multiple taps are pouring water in one place, it will fill up proportionally fast. A lot of levels feature taps in all areas so the entire level will eventually flood, leaving Quiffy with no available source of air. This aspect is how the game derives its title.</resource>

    <resource id="f3d4954a2bf68fdd64fc4a3e30ee658b28fc6a51" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Somewhere in London is a secret organization that is based on the 13th floor of an office building. The sole purpose for this organizationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s existence is to keep the current British government in power at any cost - specifically, that means helping the current Prime Minister keep ahead of his competition in the polls.

Floor 13 is a management simulation controlled by a menu-based system (similar to Darklands) and is presented in black and white for a film noir feel. Players take the role of the Director General in this secret organization, and are given a target date of 20 days to attend to their duties. During this period, performance will be evaluated based on the Prime Minister's polling results. If the PM is doing well, the agency will be expanded and will have more equipment and services available to handle the situations it will encounter later in the game. If the PM is behind, Floor 13 risks reduction in the number of services it has available or even the player's continued employment. After each successful 20 day period, another 20 days are added to the calendar, full of new problems and objectives.

During the time between target dates, players will have to deal with various problems, both externally and internally. Some examples include: saving the son of the U.S. President from terrorists, breaking up a drug ring controlled by a VIP recently honored by the Queen, or even prevent a scientist in the British space agency from publicly stating that their latest achievement has been a total sham (shades of the film &amp;quot;Capricorn One&amp;quot;). While you are completing these tasks there is another secret society that will pressure you to have its goals completed, and this may very well interfere with the missions officially assigned to Floor 13.

The Floor 13 organization is not a benevolent one and players will need to do some rather unpleasant things to ensure that the democratic machine runs smoothly. Examples of activities include: searching and looting peopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s homes, calling in commando units for heavy assault purposes, wire-tapping and trailing people without bothering to go through legal channels, discrediting notable people through the media and infiltrating established organizations. At times, you might even need to detain citizens and torture them (the torture bits can get rather graphic at times, though it's doled out through a text report), or even assassinate troublesome proles (one of the few political policy games, along with Shadow President and CyberJudas, to allow for such an activity). However if players become too eager at performing these &amp;quot;black hat&amp;quot; activities, they may draw too much attention to the agency and may summon the attention of a certain &amp;quot;Mr. Garcia&amp;quot; (who is good at helping noisy Director Generals fly through office windows).</resource>

There are 8 bases to enter, with the aim of using energy pods to cause the reactors to overload and thus malfunction.

The game is viewed side-on, resembling the ST classic Oids quite strongly; which is to say that gravity and motion physics dictate the ship's motion strongly. The 8 levels all have plenty of enemies on offer, both wall-mountings and actual ships, as well as enhanced weapons and extra fuel and shield energy. The ship can take some damage, and repairs itself over time (for no logical reason), which is one of the few things that gives you a hope of getting anywhere early on. Losing a life causes all the enemy turrets to replenish, emphasizing the restart points and making things more maze-based and methodical.

The standard selection of competitions are on offer, with a full range of club and national competitions.

Far more moves are possible in this one though, including overhead kicks, backheelers, riding tackles and even some impressive overhead kicks, all of which need practice to be perfected. Passing works in a similar way to Sensible, but requiring a longer tap, and giving more versatility in where the pass is placed. Extra details such as an on-screen referee and a zoom feature on replays are included. Kits can be edited in more detail than most games of the time as well.</resource>

This game offers a unique twist, leaving you 'managing' the career of a single player, involving matches and transfers.

You start with 10 'goal cards' - up to 3 can be played in each match, each of them giving you a shooting chance, at which point arcade action skill comes in. The better you perform, the higher your wages are, the more chance you have of a big-money transfer and international call-up, and the less chance you have of being dropped from the team.

There's also a trivia section, which asks increasingly difficult questions allowing you to go double or nothing on knowing the answers - up to £8000 a time can be won on this.

Forest Dumb Forever is a side-scrolling platform game and the sequel of Forest Dumb. The action has been moved from the forest to a castle. The aim for the player is to reach the designated number of coins and the exit gate before time runs out. All the levels are quite extensive, full of hostile animals, deadly spikes or vanishing stone platforms. Besides the coins the player can collect numerous fruits (points) scattered around the board or use trampoline pods to perform high jumps. The hostile creatures can be killed by a jump on their head. The player can use the quick run which increases the height of the jump. After each two levels a stage code is provided.

Simulmondo was running warm-up laps with Formula 1: They promise fast 3D action with variable detail, giving players the choice of true speed or high realism but at the end this was a wasted opportunity from Simulmondo to make a good racing simulation game. They mixed some arcade elements (timer, few laps, easy handling, no damage) with a bit of simulation. Unfortunately, the mix didn't get well and the result was a dull game (considering also that there was just only one circuit). On the other hand, the downs become up when played hotseat with a friend. Play it with some friends and game is really enjoyable.</resource>

As Egor, the player must search through Frankenstein's castle, the dungeons, the surrounding forest, the local village and other areas in this side-scrolling platformer. Despite the grim themes, the game is a humorous cartoonish one. Each task begins in Frankenstein's lab with the Baron telling Egor what item he requires. Egor must find it, put it in his sack and return to the lab to receive the next task. Along the way there are enemies such as ghosts, skeletons, rats, bats, animated body parts, local townsfolk and others. Instead of a health bar, Egor has a Frightometer with a range from calm to panic. Touching enemies moves it ever more towards the maximum. Once that is reached, Egor will drop what he is carrying, flee to the lab and in so doing lose a life. There is a way of reducing the meter, though: meeting up with the local serving wench will calm Egor's nerves and return it to zero. It is also reset when an item has been delivered. Once Egor has found and returned the weather chart requested by Frankenstein, the game introduces a time limit. The timer starts at around 74 minutes and counts down to the electrical storm that will bring the monster to life. Failing to collect all required items within the limit means the end of the game.</resource>

Mastering martial arts, they found their life tough but very interesting. Until one day a band of thugs attacked them.

If anything (and some may find this hard to believe) it's even simpler than Kong. Hero Freddie has to be maneuvered around the network of platforms and ladders whilst picking up the goodies and avoiding the roving nasties. Not so bad, eh? Ah, but the twist here is that Freddie can't walk through the ladders, so if he's not careful it's very easy for him to get trapped in a dead-end. However, that aside, that's pretty much all there is to say. It's simple, enjoyable and very fast paced. However, it can get a bit frustrating simply due to the ease with which you can get caught by the ghoulies. (Ahem!) All-in-all, Frantic Freddie's unlikely to keep you glued to your monitor all night long, but it's the sort of game you're likely to load up from time to time just for a quick go.</resource>

    <resource id="bdb25883f3597f3baa2d934223fa857de70127b3" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Freak Out is a fast-paced strategy game where each level takes the player to a different location, to contain the attack of the fuzzy intruders. The playing field consists of interconnected cells, arranged in concentric squares. The Freaks (which come in four different colors) pop out of a hatch at the center, and can be moved about by rotating and smacking them, which sends them jumping to the next cell (if it isn't occupied). To score points and eliminate Freaks, three of the same color must be placed in adjacent cells, making them vanish in a puff of smoke. Speed is essential, since the quickly-reproducing aliens line up behind the hatch: if you let the queue get too long, it's game over. Random items and obstacles pop up occasionally, like bonus gems, freezing ice, stone walls, or colored circles (which can only be occupied by a Freak of the same hue). As the game advances, new challenges and mini-puzzles appear, which force the player to respond before more Freaks can be eliminated. A password records the player's progress after every level.</resource>

    <resource id="783a7f3e8fb49ac61fc690522ae7e8c739b01abb" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Freedom: Rebels In The Darkness is a game that combines elements of strategy, stealth and fighting games. The main character is a rebellious black slave working on a sugar plantation that tries to incite a revolt among the slave population to gain freedom and to give comeuppance to each of their old masters.

At the start of the game there is four characters to choose, each with different statistics and abilities like &amp;quot;constitution&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;lock-picking&amp;quot;. The main game screen is a map of the plantation, where you guide a small icon of the character while trying to avoid the guard dogs. If the dogs find you, they either bark and alert the owners or attack you. When they do, the screen switches to a first-person screen where you have to avoid being bitten and killed by the animal.

On the top of the screen there are four buttons, each with a unique function:
Path-finding lets you click on the map with a cursor and see a description of each hut and house.
Movement allows you to move your character. Left-clicking shows a first-person view of your surroundings. This screen can vary depending of the place where you are in the map. Most of the time is the recruitment screen, where you click on your brother slaves to amass a army. Their response is a random &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;no&amp;quot;. If you click while on a sugar field, you get the option of climbing the huts, picking the storage hut lock, or setting fire to the premises. If you click while on the housings of the owner or one of his henchmen, you get the option of either confronting the person, or running away. If you decide to confront him, the screen switches to a side-view similar to fighting games like Street Fighter, with two energy bars at the bottom, where you have to fight one of the owner's men. If you win, you have the choice of killing the person or holding him captive.
Review is the game statistics screen, where you can see your progress in the game.
Advice only starts working once you get the support of either the shaman or the medicine man. They can heal any wound sustained by dog attacks and fights.
The game accepts mouse, keyboard and joystick controls, and plays drum music and other sounds.</resource>

The action moves through eight levels, set both in space and on the ground (with such environments as a jungle planet and a water world). While most levels have a technological theme, some feature organic enemies and backgrounds, reminiscent of games like R-Type or Xenon 2. Going with tradition, each level has a huge end boss.

The player's ship can collect a variety of power-ups: lasers and missiles, shooting to the front, the back or the sides. Speed-ups and shields are also available. Power-ups are revealed by destroying certain enemies or special bonus capsules, and several are given to the player for free at the start of a level. The weapons can be upgraded by collecting the same power-up several times.

The game features a two-player mode, with two ships moving against the aliens at the same time.</resource>

Keep an eye out for the unhealthy as they will drain your lifeforce; too much bad blood and you're a dead vampire. You can run back to your coffin if you're low on health to regenerate, as well, you must be back in your coffin before the sun comes up, or you're a toasty vampire.</resource>

You must navigate your way through planet Cosmica, and rescue your brethren, within the limited 'Twang' energy you have.

Cosmica is full of hideous monsters, many of which can be shot. Your character builds momentum as it moves, so some hazards are easier to clear from a running start. You can only jump vertically, although you have control as the character falls. Ammunition is limited, and must be collected throughout your quest.

Three sweets which enhance your character can be collected - the red one increases your speed, blue increases the height of your leap, and green means you can safely fall further. There are additional objects to pick up and use as well.</resource>

Up to four players land on a planet with their motherships, trying to gather as much ore as possible within 24 game rounds.

This almost sounds like a happy, idyllic round of pick-the-flowers, if it weren't for the truckload of tanks and destroyers that each players happens to have in the cargo area of his mothership. So the players usually spend an equal amount of time picking up ore and bashing their contenders' heads in.

The computer game is an accurate conversion of the board game; virtually every feature is present. Strategy is needed to succeed in the game. The only semi-random thing are the tides (high tide, low tide, and something in-between) which can strand boats and engulf tanks, but even they can be partially predicted.</resource>

The game takes place on a huge island separated into eight regions: Desert, Lagoon, Forest, Pyramids, Mountains, Factory, Village, and finally the Castle.

For the US release, the title was changed to 'Pac-In-Time'. It's exactly the same game. Only the characters were changed : the not-so-known European Tinies (from the Skweek, Super Skweek, Tiny Skweeks/Brainies/Tinies games) were replaced by the widely known Pac-Man.

The programmers of the games had previously worked for Cinemaware and MicroProse.

The gameplay options are also quite varied: Each game can be played one player alone, two players alternately, two players simultaneously, or one player against one of three computer personalities -- including split-screen play for head-to-head competition.</resource>

The game has 32 levels and was one of the first games using 32 colours (5 bitmaps) simultaneously outmatching all the Atari ST games that were limited to 16 colours. Furthermore the games used the Hi-Res graphics mode of the Amiga for the first loading screen. This had not been used in a commercial game on Amiga before.</resource>

    <resource id="6639e97f85d7b4b228c09cfbea6db96b17f6e368" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">A lot of creatures called fuzzballs, are released in an old wizards castle by his young apprentice. The young man is also turned into one of the fluffy creatures himself, by accident. The old wizard gets a little upset, and orders the apprentice to get rid of the fuzzballs swarming all over his castle. If he succeeds, the wizard will turn him back to human form again.

This is a platform game, with 50 levels. To complete each level, you'll have to collect all the treasures, while at the same time avoiding, or killing, various enemies. You will face mostly other fuzzballs, but also other creatures. Each level is only a single Bubble Bobblish screen, but can take a while to complete anyway.

Touching an enemy once means instant death, and if you don't complete a level in time, you will be killed by mosquitoes entering the screen. To succeed in Fuzzball, you'll have to plan every move carefully, otherwise you'll die very quickly.

If you fail to complete a section in the allotted time, you will lose a life, but the number of planes shot down previously is not reset, making the second attempt easier. As you destroy more enemies, you gain access to better planes.</resource>

This is a quite simple platformer which starts with a rather steep learning curve. The game is a mix of two genres: an ordinary platformer, combined with a quiz game, asking single-choice questions from the player (three choices in total). Short instructions: Find the crystal and return it back to the time machine. You cannot free the crystal until you have answered ALL questions correctly. H - pause game U - use item (remote control, gun, mirror, monkey-wrench, mask, moonhopper) Pull down the joystick to pick up the bodies of nasties you previously paralyzed by jumping upon. Pressing FIRE will &amp;quot;dispose&amp;quot; them eventually. (NOTE: you must have your hands free to pick up anything, i. e. if you're holding an item, you will have to put it away first)

Later levels are linear, better graphics, quite good and good controls spoiled by inertia.</resource>

The game is a blend of action sequences in an Afterburner-esque pseudo-3D view. These sequences vary between ground combat, aerial combat and space combat, with different motion physics and enemy craft. There is also a strategic battle choices on a galactic map invaded in real-time.

The PC version uses speaker tweaks to recreate the game's tune on theoretically-inferior hardware.

The player controls a spaceship that can only move left and right at the bottom of the screen. The aim of the game is to destroy as many enemy waves as possible without losing all of the extra lives. Pressing the fire button fires a shot at the enemy attack waves, which enter the screen from different edges. The only other movement possible for the player is a diagonal shot, by moving the controller in the opposite direction they want to fire. The game gets gradually harder with waves appearing behind the player or large amounts of enemy shots the player has to avoid. Having its roots in an arcade game, the objective of Galaxy 89 is to gain the highest possible score. Destroying waves of enemies gives the player points, as well as the bonus rounds considering mostly of cannon fodder-type enemies that occur after clearing a certain number of waves.</resource>

You can play eight events, including Velodrome Sprint Cycling, Hurdles, Pole Vault, Hammer-throw, Uneven Parallel Bars, Rings, Archery, and Springboard Diving. You can practice each event separately or play the whole competition.

The game also features a multiple player option, this makes it a nice party game. If you are alone, you can compete against the computer.

If you're stuck in an event, or want to get better, just take the coaching book (= the manual) and read how you can make more tricks. It also features many real facts of the history of the Olympic summer games.</resource>

My heart sank when I saw the cover of this game... not another Empire Strikes Back ripoff. Jeff Minter made a fortune out of a game called Attack of the Mutant Camels on the C64, and that was about a million times better as a game than this rather turgid attempt to rekindle an ancient idea. Sure, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been written for the American market, and perhaps they donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t mind this sort of rubbish, but in this country, the competition is a little stiffer.

The screen is divided into thirds for the action, the scanner and the score. You fly your ship in a Defender style fashion from the right to the left and back again, trying to destroy the big walkers as they lumber from left to the right. 

The game is fast, to be sure, but with no real control over whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s happening to your ship, if you take off too slowly you get shot; fly faster and you get out of control and crash into one of the Deathbots.
The sounds are depressingly similar to the sound effects from the Star Wars games, although nicely synthesised rather than sampled. The sound you get outside the action is a little bit boring, being just a synthesised throb. The graphics are nice enough, but somehow a little bit wooden, what I would call 8 bitty.

Ganymed is derivative, and frankly a bit of a letdown compared to other games of itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s type. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m reminded of FirebirdÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Return to Genesis, which although in a similar price range is a much more enjoyable game, being better thought out and well presented.

Cheats:
During play push the joystick to turn your ship around and quickly press 'SPACE'. You must press 'SPACE' before your ship turns completely around. Now press '.' on the numeric keypad. This will give you a free life. This only works once per level.</resource>

Winter's Tail is a three-part program, with the option of playing each section in whichever order you desire. Part One rests your paws at the top of a steep ski slope. The next load contains two separate levels, the first of which is more akin to a bonus stage, where you must waggle the joystick at great speed to scoff as much lasagne as possible. The second part moves you over into the Chocolate Factory. Achieve success in this section and you are whisked off to the final load. It's Torville and Dean time as you skate around an iced-over lake in pursuit of an escaped Chocolate Chicken.

Winter's Tail does have its drawbacks, however. The sprites, although large, colourful and immediately recognisable, tend to move too slowly, especially on the skiing level where a hasty slide to the left or right is essential in avoiding some of the obstacles (I also noticed that collision detection was somewhat suspect on this level, too). Still, Winter's Tail deserves to do well, being an instantly playable, enjoyable tie-in of everyone's favourite moggy.</resource>

    <resource id="9476f33cc263a39e2ab665ce7e72b5c99ec24785" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Garrison was produced by Rainbow Arts, a highly skilled European Amiga demo group, as a Gauntlet clone.



In case you're not familiar with Gauntlet, it's a multi-directional-scrolling, top-down view, dungeon based shoot-em-up, (phew). You and some friends dash around various dungeon levels, collect potions, treasure and food, killing ghosts, goblins and anything else that looks at you oddly. The various baddies are generated by some object or other, a collection of bones in the case of the ghosts, and if you destroy these generators, you at least know that after wiping all the remaining enemy no more will be produced. Some enemies fire projectiles at you, some just drain health by making physical contact. Death, a character in black, pursues you doggedly, and when he touches you, your health decreases at an alarming rate.



It's all very good, and for it's time was a pretty a good programming job with some nice touches that typically eluded US Gold's official version. The rock guitar music in the intro is slightly reminiscent of Dire Straits' 'Money for Nothing' and there's the odd 'copper' trick that doubtless made us feel superior to owners of the Atari ST. The player's sprites are pretty slow at covering ground though, and generally it feels much less frantic than it did back in 1987.



This is an excellent Gauntlet clone that is best played with two players, due to the high difficulty of the game. There is a plot involving a princess, and the graphics and sound is great. There is actually one data disk that can be used with the original game. With the data disk, the levels are modified and the title screen looks similar to Gauntlet II. This is the only Gauntlet clone on the Amiga, so I'll say this: if you have played Atari's arcade game and want to play it at home, then Garrison is for you.</resource>

(Also known as Litti's Hot-Shot!) is a soccer game in which two teams try to win the match. The adjustable options are the number of players, the time of a half time and the AI level. The game is played in a top-down view and only shows a part of the playfield.

The player either controls the athlete in ball possession or, when in defense, the one which is nearest. When shooting, the power of the shot depends on how long the button was pressed and the direction changes with the joystick movement, e.g. moving against the walking direction results in a overhead kick.

Gary Lineker's Hot-Shot! is sad. Really.</resource>

A four-division Super League of top European clubs is featured, with the potential for multiple managers to play. You can buy, scout for and sell players, and set up individual tactical systems.

The in-game action has a side-scrolling view and close ball control. The game is tolerant of tough tackles, as these are usually successful and rarely result in a foul. You can swerve, chip and head the ball in any direction.</resource>

It targets the feel of pioneering races between 250mph planes in the valleys of the southern USA between brave but honest goggle-wearing men - a sort of Mille Miglia in the sky.

The game consists of 16 courses, which are marked out by giant suspended cones, each of which is to be completed against a time limit, while avoiding contact with the other planes. You must stay within the cones, any time spent outside it results in the alloted time ticking down at a prohibitively fast rate (so don't think of short-cutting the track). After every second successful race, you take on a bonus track, in which balloons must be hit for points.

The basic idea is that you are presented with 2 sets of tiles, and must make the left one identical to the 'control' set on the right. The colours are defined in a sequence - red, green, blue, purple, yellow - and when you click on a tile, that tile's colour moves forward by two in that sequence (for example a blue one becomes yellow), whereas the tiles next to it move by one colour (for example, blue becomes purple). 

Any that move past the end fo the sequence disappear, causing surrounding blocks to drop. You get a limited number of moves, and limited time as well. Fortuantely there are passwords, delivered by cutely-drawn naked Japanese girls (although the private parts are covered up).

Spanning five short yet difficult worlds, the game borrows its visual style heavily from its better-known contemporaries like Shadow of the Beast and Ghosts 'n' Goblins.

A simple arcade-style action game with some rudimentary adventuring and timing based puzzles thrown in, Ghost Battle casts you as a nameless hero on a quest to rescue his, yet again, nameless girlfriend from a nameless bad guy. Enemies have a horror look and feel to them - ghouls and disembodied heads for example. Initially our hero is armed with rocks, but extra weapons can be collected for specific tasks such as the bosses who end each level.</resource>

In the first scene, the Ghostbusters must collect slime samples from the sewers. One Ghostbuster is being lowered into a shaft on a cable and must collect the samples at the bottom. On the way down, many ghosts will try to stop him. Some of them try to saw off the cable, others deplete his courage upon touching him. He can destroy them with proton beams or bombs or employ a shield so they can't touch him. Weapon power-ups and elixirs that restore courage can be found on ledges in the shaft and can be reached by swinging. Several parts of a slime scooper must also be collected in this way before the samples can be collected.

In the second scene, the Ghostbusters have animated the Statue of Liberty via the slime and with her help must travel to the Museum of Art. Lady Liberty automatically walks to the right and can use her torch to shoot at the many enemy ghosts in her way. Her slime supply drains constantly however. Defeated ghosts drop slime, which can be collected by sending out the little people at Liberty's feet to pick it up and return it so the supply can be refilled.

In the third scene, the Ghostbusters confront big bad Vigo in the museum, seen in isometric view. First, all four of them have to be lowered into the museum on ropes, their speed controlled via joystick movements. Dropping too fast can stun them and take them out of the following fight. In the fight, the player can switch between the four guys at any time. Goals are to defeat Janosz, carry away baby Oscar before Vigo can enter him (Janosz will come after Oscar if he's still alive) and finally catch Vigo in the crossfire of two proton beams.</resource>

Along the way the player can pick up new weapons, bonuses and extra suits of armor that can help in this task.[2]

The game is often considered very difficult by arcade standards and is commonly regarded as one of the most difficult games ever released. The player can only be hit twice before losing a life (the first hit takes away Arthur's armor, and the player must continue on in his underwear until completing the level or finding replacement armor). If the player loses a life, he is returned to the start of the level, or the halfway point if he has managed to get that far. Furthermore, each life can only last a certain length of time (generally around three minutes), the clock being reset at the start of a level. If the clock does run out, the player instantly loses that life.

After defeating the final boss, but only with the cross weapon (if the player does not have the cross weapon, they will be prompted that it is needed to defeat the boss and restart at the beginning of level 5 and must repeat round 5 and 6 again regardless if the weapon is obtained immediately or not) for the first time the player is informed that the battle was &amp;quot;a trap devised by Satan&amp;quot;. The player must then replay the entire game on a higher difficulty level to reach the genuine final battle.</resource>

It starts to send strange waves that modify the behaviour of objects. Suddenly the TV transforms into a jar of pickles. Giddy decides to fight the menace, and return his homeland to normality. But first, he is going to eat the pickles.

Giddy 2 is an Amiga freeware clone of Dizzy and its sequels. Intended as parody of that classic series, it also stars an anthropomorphic egg that must collect objects in order to solve puzzles. On the top screen there are three heart-shaped energy bars for the three lives of the character. If the egg touches any of the enemies, this energy bar decreases, and when it is completely drained the egg explodes with an onomatopoeic &amp;quot;SPLAT!&amp;quot;, and the player loses a life. On the top-right side there is the accumulated number of coins collected by the character. Below both items is a black strip that displays the inventory content when in use mode (pressing the space bar enters the use mode, where the player moves the joystick left or right to cycle through the assembled inventory, and hits fire to use the selected object).</resource>

This is an Action game, developed and published by Swiss Computer Arts, which was released in Europe in 1988.

The number of Arkanoid clones on the 16-bit machines is already remarkable, and here, complete with Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ- anoidÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ suffix, is yet another. Indeed, Giganoid is the most blatant version yet, with identical bat, bonus capsules, and screen surrounds. Stand by for a possible joint Imagine/Taito legal case against Swiss Computer Arts! The game of Giganoid itself, though, is unlikely to cause any ripples, as it is just the usual very competently programmed affair with no real improvements over Impact, my own favorite of the genre. Anyone who hasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t seen the many other interpretations of the theme should be well impressed with Giganoid, but only an unusual highscore table screen with impressive rotating coloured bars and didgeridoo samples stick in my mind.

If you already have the Imagine original or AudiogenicÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s impressive Impact, donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t bother with Giganoid, if you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t, this is the one to check out.

Cheats:
On the player select screen, press the Ã¢â‚¬ËœCAPS LOCKÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ key, so the key light is on. Now press and hold the Ã¢â‚¬ËœCAPS LOCKÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and press fire. A message should appear letting you know the cheat is active. If you held down the fire button a little to long the game may have started and bypassed the message, but you should notice you have a lot of lives.</resource>

    <resource id="201360e6de1326fe72eace803b9e1f5065fa7ee8" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Gnome is a Platform game, developed by Vision and published by Linel, which was released in Europe in 1991.

Game that follows the classic Ã¢â‚¬Ëœpick up a bunch of objects to advance to the next levelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ style, but adds a few interesting twists of itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own. Unfortunately, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re not very well implemented and the game ends up playing like a below average PD game. WhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the game like, then, and why does it fail at being addictive?  Well, read on, and it will all be revealed.

In Gnome, you control a gnome (well, duh!) whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mission it is to pick up as many diamonds as possible. However, the twist is that these diamonds arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t scattered about the single screen levels from the start, but have to be created by the gnome. This is done by throwing a mushroom seed on the ground, and waiting for the seed to grow into large mushroom, which will eventually pop and reveal a diamond. Should you fail to pick up a certain number of diamonds within a time limit, you lose a life.

To help you, you can buy loads of cool stuff from a shop after every second level. The goodies include speedup potions, enemy slowdowns, extra life, and a bunch of other stuff.

So far, so good, then? Well, no. You see, by buying these upgrades, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re making the game incredibly easy. What should have been a frantic hunt for diamonds turn into simply waiting for the mushrooms to pop, while avoiding the occasional slow moving wizard or horned monster. The level design is incredibly bland, and the levels themselves offer no challenges or obstacles at all. The only thing thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s challenged by this game is your patience.

This is a pity, because this game might have been a very addictive game if it had been playtested  properly. The graphics are simple, but pleasant enough, and the music is nice. But the game isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t worth your money, so donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t buy it. If you can find it for download on one of the legal adf archives, you might want to have a go at it, though...</resource>

As a result, they exile her using a teleporting spell, leaving her lost in the forest. It is your job to keep her safe in this interactive fiction game.

The game is split into three tasks, broadly relating to animal, vegetable and mineral in that order. The first involves defeating an evil witch, the second is the Riddle of the Shrinking Teapot, and the third involves precious stones.

Commands such as FOLLOW, FIND and GO TO make travelling the game world much easier, and put an emphasis on object-manipulation and character interaction, rather than map-making.

Instructions can be issued to other characters, with words like THEN, FIND and GIVE to join them. This co-operation is essential to solve many puzzles, and takes place in a world where characters have their own aims and motives. There are BRIEF and VERBOSE modes of text. The screen display adds a 'g' to the start of all words beginning with n - 'gnorth' and 'gnugget' for example.

The control is loose, making it tricky to keep the ball while dribbling, and holding down fire when the ball is at your feet will trap it, allowing you to pass it more easily.

Teams from various European countries are included, and you can customise these by moving players around, and changing the starting lineups and formations. An Arcade Challenge mode sees you play matches against each of the 5 computer team speeds, in succession, until you lose one - you can also arrange leagues or play individual matches.

A wide range of options are included, with variable wind settings, a range of pitches and referees, variable match lengths, and the chance to play up/down or left/right, a choice of close or distant view, and variable computer speed and skill (these can be combined to vary the game quite significantly).

A voodoo doll has turned their king Angoulafre mad and by collecting the components they can track down Niak the Wizard, the only one who can put things right. The player needs to solve various puzzles by combining the different skills of the three goblins. It's possible switch between them and control them separately. Most of the puzzles are based on coordinated actions. One can cast powerful but erratic spells, another can collect and use objects, and the last can hit things. Action icons are activated at the bottom of the screen. The game takes in 22 landscapes, each of which has puzzles which must be cleared. The characters have limited energy, which can be sapped by traps.

Two countries respectively ruled by Queen Xina and King Bodd have been competing over the right to explore the labyrinth. However, strange events started happening one after the other: the guardian of the labyrinth died, his daughter disappeared, and King Bodd apparently fell under some sort of a curse. A goblin reporter named Blount get caught in the midst of these events as he attempts to interview the queen and the king. As if that weren't enough, Blount also gets bitten by a werewolf and falls in love, and must find a way to deal with both predicaments.

Goblins Quest is the third entry in the Gobliiins series. Like its predecessors, it is a puzzle adventure game with the emphasis on solving complex tasks confined to smaller areas rather than on exploration</resource>

    <resource id="895ec6630719125a0c5375786e2c7967b6f19c0d" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Bret Conrad is another one of those Vietnam vets with a slight psychological problem. Apparently when bullets fly  kind of lose control a bit of a drawback in a Special Forces commando.

Conrad quest is a flickscreen arcade adventure. He can walk, jump, make long somersaulting jumps, duck, climb ladders and ropes. Hes also armed with a Browning pistol, drawn with a short tap on the firebutton; you can then swing the gun in an arc. Other actions are accessed via the space bar: the icons at the bottom of the screen show the Gun option. Reload (usually automatic, but you might want to top up before nasty screens), Machete (hack at enemies at close range) and Pull Lever. There are also four special options which become available at certain places in the game.

The graphics are generally very good, but youd expect that of a flickscreen game and everything acts as it it in treacle with even the bullets taking their time to move. Each screen was a puzzle requiring deft use of the icon system to beat. Gold provides the same feel of slow, but extremely tough and unforgiving gameplay which demands both careful thought and very fast reactions. Later levels provide plenty of graphic variety and fresh puzzles so it rewards persistence. Without a save game it would be much too frustrating.

Yeah, its worth a look for the excellent and highly varied graphics, good tunes and all-round gloss but youl need quite a bit of patience to stick with it.</resource>

    <resource id="d4fc7e05d176e18e11328b7c59f99fcff20278a1" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">In Gold Rush!, Jerrod Wilson (the player) receives a letter from his long-lost brother (who fled the city years before when was hastily accused and convicted of a crime he didn't commit) asking him to join in Sacramento, California. If that's not enough for Jerrod sell everything and give his hometown Brooklyn a fond adieu, under the stamp was one of the first nuggets of Californian gold seen in the Atlantic shores of the United States. So, Jerrod bids farewell to his peaceful life as a newspaper editor, and becomes a fore-runner in the the great Gold Rush of 1849, hoping to find his brother and &amp;quot;strike gold&amp;quot; (literally). Released late into the lifespan of Sierra's AGI engine, Gold Rush! features some tricks not seen before the more advanced SCI engine, such as enlarged characters, but it is best known for the three routes available to reach California: by land, travel by boat to reach the Atlantic shore of Panama, cross the isthmus, and then get a second boat in the Pacific shore, or making the dangerous all-boat trip by Cape Horn. Each route has it's dangers: Cholera might strike as you make your way across the Northern states or your boat might sink.. As usual with Sierra adventures, instant killing happens if the player is careless, but will also happen at random. Other important (and innovative) concept is the game being timed. If Jerrod takes too long to leave Brooklyn, passages to California increase in price, and his house devalues.</resource>

In order to defeat the tyrant and regain his family's palace, he must tread the golden path, the road to transcendence.

The Golden Path is a point and click adventure game. Instead of using verbs like in Maniac Mansion, the player controls the monk with the mouse by moving a cursor shaped like a Chinese letter and clicking directly at him on the screen. Left-clicking on a spot on the ground moves the monk towards it. Left-clicking below Y'n Hsi makes him bend over to drop or pick objects on the ground. Left-clicking above his head makes him try to use the object he is holding at the moment (if it is not possible to do so, a question mark appears). Right-clicking makes him punch and kick, his defense against enemies. Every time the monk is hit, the inventory briefly flashes. A book sits at the bottom-left of the screen, and serves as a hint system of sorts. When clicking on it, a message about the screen appears with explanations to events, characters and objects. Besides the book is the inventory with four slots for objects. Left-clicking on an object places it on Y'n Hsi hands. Above the inventory is a slowly withering vine as the energy bar. It grows with the completion of certain tasks. 

The main objective is to follow the golden path. Literally. On the bottom-right of the screen there is a small version of the main game screen that shows the path and its bifurcations. The character moves from screen to screen collecting things laying around, fighting the occasional enemy and using the right object at the right place.

Pressing S saves the game, while typing L loads it.</resource>

This game has colourful and attractive graphics but everything else is sub-par. The music is sort of monotonous (literally) and the SFX are thin and underused. Added to that, the animation is rather poor, the controls are a bit iffy, the level design is dire, etc.

On the brighter side, though, the weapons system is quite OK, if a bit conservative. But that and a few good graphics filled with primary colours are not enough to make this game any good. Average and, thus, passable.</resource>

The rest of the game offers no surprises: the player takes the role of a soccer team, either during a friendly match or a tournament, and tries to win. The athletes are directly controlled and are able to perform actions like shooting or passing. There are various match settings available, e.g. difficulty level or match length.

Big sporting events are quite often responsible for the release of quite a few computer sports games. Krisalis havenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t missed the bandwagon either, with their Graham Taylor-licensed management game.

You are placed in the driving seat of a hopeful third-division side trying to break through to the higher divisions (and win one or two cup matches to boot). As well as the usual picking of team member and organising of training, you also have to do some nifty dealing to keep your side together.

Graham TaylorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Soccer Challenge is a very slickly produced footy manager game, with more options and features than your usual management sim. Even though there is a lot of game content, the game still manages to offer a lot of smooth presentation to keep you interested. The match-day sections are well done, replacing the usual tiny, badly-animated sprites with some very nice-looking football.

Although the game is not exactly Player Manager, it is still a worthy attempt. If youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re a budding Graham Taylor, then this could have you plugging at the league for some time. Just remember to put three men up front when you are playing Sweden!</resource>

You have the choice to drive a Ferrari 187/88C, a McLaren MP4/4 or a Williams FW12, each with different qualities. Rival drivers also have their own styles and strengths, and to win the World Championship you will have to master these. Pitstop timing and planning is crucial as well, although only tires are changed in late-1980s F1.

You can choose whether to drive a single race at Brazil, Britain, Monaco, (Western) Germany [Hockenheim], Canada, Italy, Detroit and Japan [Suzuka] or to drive a full championship on every track. Every Race includes a qualifying round. The graphics in the game are sprite-based.</resource>

It was licensed around Spanish ace Jorge Martinez 'Aspar', and your (and his) racing rivals including future 500cc World Champion Alex Criville.

The game features a full practice mode as well as qualifying and races. There are only 8 computer bikes, although the real life championship points system is used, meaning that the penalty for not finishing is bigger than in real life, especially as you only have 5 bikes to last the season. The game is viewed from overhead, and the controls are, unusually, direction based, so to take a straight which (in the overhead view) involves going up and to the right, you must push the joystick in that direction.

A variety of puzzle types with a wide and whimsical supporting cast kept classes of kids debating the correct course of action through an array of different environments, progress through each tracked courtesy of a password system.

Some 15 or so years later, the game's developers eventually released a multimedia-enhanced remake of it for modern operating systems.</resource>

Centers of gravity create &amp;quot;pits&amp;quot; on that grid, which are the basic obstacles to maneuver around. An alien species called &amp;quot;Outies&amp;quot; plans on transforming all suns of the galaxy into black holes. They feed off raw energy, and as black holes are a good source of that, they attempt to create as many as possible of them.

You task is to pilot a small spaceship through a series of mazes spaceship and collect various cargo containers on your way. Your spaceship obeys to the law of gravity. You have to use a single thruster to avoid collision with walls or the ground. Various types of enemies will try to hinder your cargo salvage missions.

The single player part of the game consists of a total of 49 mazes. After each five successfully finished levels you will receive a password that allows you to choose the corresponding level as starting point in the main menu. The ten highest scores achieved will be permanently saved on disk.

There are three other game modes available: Race, Two Pilot Race and Dogfight.
In Race mode you can choose one of 10 available tracks and try to achieve best times. You'll have to avoid obstacles similar to the one found single player mission mode, a crash means that the race is over. If you succeed in achieving a track record it will be saved permanently also.
Two Pilot Race offers three different tracks. The screen is splitted into two parts. Your only task is to reach the finish line before your opponent. If you crash you'll be respawned at the starting point.
Dogfight offers two tracks where you can fight against another player. The player which lost all lives first is the looser.

This tennis simulation has some nice features. First you create your player. You can distribute some character points (for example: speed, forehand, backhand, etc.) like a role-playing game. These skills will raise after a few winning matches. Then you must select the tournaments you will play. There are all ATP tournaments for choice-  you can also play the Davis Cup. After every tournament you get some price money. There you must play the single and double matches.

In training you can also play against a ball machine or against a friend. It's also possible to play 1 against 2.

The player's character is &amp;quot;an aspiring member of the infamous Guild of Thieves&amp;quot; and is to steal all the valuables that can be found in and around an island castle. The game features &amp;quot;extremely atmospheric&amp;quot; descriptions and 30 artistic renditions of key locations. Included in the game package are a faux newsletter of the Guild of Thieves titled What Burglar providing instructions and hints for the game, a Bank of Kerovnia Trading Account Card, a guild contract detailing the arrangement between the player's character and the Guild of Thieves and small dice.</resource>

His task on each level is to pick up boxes of the cereal, add honey and drive the train to the end of the level, where the cargo is loaded into a big box of Guldkorn.

It is not just a straight forward career along the tracks, though. Switches must be set back and forth for the train to go on the right tracks, there are rocks and fallen trees on the track, and you must keep your speed so as not to crash into things. Fortunately for Puff the bear, he has a honeybee friend. By tapping the joystick button, you activate the bee. It is the bee's task to activate the switches and to operate the honey tap. If you hold in the joystick button, you activate an action menu to deal with obstacles. You can choose to jump over fallen trees, throw dynamite at rocks or to let the bear jump out and dig away dirt from the tracks.

    <resource id="bcd398ccd00455c194add56e7f5c4d7def51e583" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Gulp! is a Puzzle game, developed and published by I.C.E., which was released in Europe in 1994.

Gulp! is ICEÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first release since the rather ill-fated Total Carnage, and it s nice to see that itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s actually a reasonably good game. As you can probably tell from the screenshots, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ got an awful lot to do with fish. To capture the essence of Gulp! in a nutshell, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Lemmings underwater, but with much more interaction with the background.

The aim of each level is to get a certain number of fish from the inlet pipe to the exit, while avoiding everything if possible. The levels are large, and fairly intricately laid out. Most people will find Gulp! incredibly hard to play for the first hour or two, simply because there is so much to watch out for, and so much going on at once. Thankfully, you are able to pause the game and scroll around the map, so you shouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t find it too much trouble planning your route; itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just the execution thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the hard part.

Gulp! isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t a bad game at all. Although it sometimes can get very confused on screen, there are some really nice ideas in there. It wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t hook everyone In fact. I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t even think it will hook everyone who liked Lemmings. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll either love it with a passion, or youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll play it once and never look at it again. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a time-honoured statement, but I think with this one youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re really going to have to try before you buy.</resource>

Your Gunboat carries a crew of four men:

- A first-class petty officer who serves as boat captain and pilot
- A gunner’s mate, who controls the forward guns
- An engine man, who takes care of the engines and serves as midship gunner
- A seaman who controls the aft guns

All four men are cross-trained in each other’s tasks … redundancy becomes crucial if one or two crew members are wounded or dead.

Be careful on the rivers ...!

The world outside your 'copter is viewed in first person perspective, as usual, and that is how it stays. There are no outside views, there are no missile-eye views. There are no zoom facilities. There is not even a chase plane option. But that is a much more sensible way to generate atmosphere. It is a bit hard to believe in a flight simulator if you are pouncing around outside your plane, zooming in and out, not really flying. In Gunship, you are restricted to three views: look forward, look left and right, and that is the way it should be. After all there are not external views on a real chopper, are there?

This flight sim is fun. The controls are a little sluggish, but I get the feeling that is how they are supposed to handle; after all, this is a low-level combat chopper, not a Fiat Uno. The graphics are great. The clever use of shading mixed with filled vectors gives the game a very solid feel, especially where the enemy craft is concerned. Tanks look like tanks, AA guns look like real AA guns, small frightened people look like real frightened people.

The design of the game is identical in every detail to the 64 version, right down to the loading sequence. The missions follow along the same lines, the five areas you fly over are identical.
What you have here is the same brilliant game, but adapted to suit an Amiga, with better sound, graphics and playability. So who can complain?</resource>

    <resource id="dd37fe1dbc887b3d4f8b75e7dd078bd9bf445e51" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Guy Spy is quite easily one of the most eagerly awaited games of the year. From its initiation early on in January, and our special In Development article six months ago, interest has snowballed Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the question on everyoneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lips was: can real gameplay be added to ReadysoftÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s stunning cartoon-quality graphics? Now, more than eighteen months on, the finished product is poised to hit the shelves and revolutionize the world of interactive gaming.

Guy Spy is presented as a cartoon adventure in much the same way as the DragonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Lair series before it. In fact, the whole thing has been produced in more or less the same vein as Space Ace but features longer, more playable sections, with the player actually controlling Guy rather than guiding him when necessary. The term Ã¢â‚¬ËœInteractiveÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ when used to describe Guy Spy is still slightly misleading, though, as itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s more interactive than most games. Although you do exercise control over the character, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s still never more than walk left, step right, punch or whatever.

Of the thirteen levels itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fair to say that most are enjoyable, but thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s only a handful youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll want to play again. The best levels have been sensibly placed sporadically to keep the interest up, though, and there are enough of them to keep you coming back for more. Couple these with the fine and other humorous link animations and three difficulty settings, and the game goes a long way to restore credibility to Readysoft gaming.

This is the closest anyone has come to a fully animated and playable adventure and the Canadian-base company deserve enormous credit. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s still not the perfect cartoon-quality game, but I seriously doubt whether a floppy-based Amiga would ever be able to house such a project anyway. That said, though, what Readysoft have achieved here is admirable and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a hefty step in the right direction and one that deserves praise. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s by no means perfect, but give it a whirl regardless.</resource>

You're starting into the adventure as a real hacker would do, lacking information of what is to come, only driven by your ambition. Consequently, the game opens with a plain text screen, prompting you for the login password. To break into the system is the first puzzle you've got to solve.

Once in, you'll soon find out that you've accidentally stumbled upon a conspiracy of global impact. From then on, you'll maneuver a robotic drone around the globe through a tunnel system deep in the earth. In major cities, you may surface and talk to contact persons, who'll trade items for cash. When delivered to the correct city, you can exchange these items for a piece of evidence. If all evidence is collected, you're to inform the FBI. As if figuring out the correct routes and trades wasn't hard enough, frequent system malfunctions and security checks test your skill as well...

Once again you hack into a computer system, just to end up saving the world. Hacker II: The Doomsday Papers opens with the console to the &amp;quot;Actisource&amp;quot; computer hotline system (a nice self-ironic pun - although nobody knows why a serious hacker might want to crack a help service for computer games...). However, your quiet little hack is soon disturbed: The government wants you for a secret mission. It, again, involves a robot drone and you're the one at the remote control. Although this time, it's not the whole globe that's your playground, but a high security facility in Russia, where the plans for global domination are hidden.

In fact, all you've got to do is to guide your drone to the vault on a 2D map of the building. However, there are two major obstacles: Patrolling guards and security cameras. To avoid detection, you've got to trick the observers. By tapping the surveillance system you can see what cameras are currently active and which rooms they monitor. Your task is to bypass the video signal of the right cameras with a taped recording of an empty room, so that your drone is hidden from the view. You control four monitors, which you may freely switch to show the security monitor, the radar map, VCR output or one of the 38 cameras -- thus keeping an eye on guard movement while simultaneously controlling your drone and synchronizing recordings to cameras.

Do you still remember those fun old games, with no plot, where you simply wanted to set the high score? Well Hammer Boy is a game just like that. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re a boy with a hammer (I bet youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d never guess that one) and your task is to protect the flag! The flag is flying on the top of the tower behind you and there are various enemies trying to take away. Every attack will last 99 seconds (see the counter in the top right corner) and then youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be taken to the next level.

The enemies will try to climb into your base or otherwise damage it (in level one you need to fight off the Indians climbing a wooden fort and shooting burning arrows; the second level takes you to a pirate ship; the third one takes place in a medieval castle; the fourth one in a moon base; and so on). Now as you advance, everything gets more difficult, but you also get more equipment. At the moon base you already get to shoot lasers (when standing to the most right, or most left position).

The graphics are nice enough, although the animation isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t as smooth as it could be. The boy isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t moving he simply disappears from one location and appears at the next one. The sound is nothing much, but it does the job.

Have fun! Tons of fun!</resource>

They try to put things right, and come under your control in this side-view action game with adventure elements.

You can switch between the two characters at any moment, and must use this wisely as their abilities differ greatly. On each screen you must kill all enemies, as well as taking out the robots which keep the doors locked.

    <resource id="e9cb244eadbb937375fe1ecddd527df8b251d66e" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Hanse is a managerial strategy game set in the 14th century. The player takes the role of an ambitious citizen who wants to become the mayor of LÃƒÂ¼beck. To reach this goal he has to get rich by trading with other cities of the Hanseatic League.

The basic gameplay principle is simple: shipping salt and exchanging it for other goods which then can be sold in LÃƒÂ¼beck for a good price. This means the current salt price is the most important part when planning shipments (besides the weather). Of course the player also has to purchase and maintain other things, e.g. a trading station, ships and cannons. Alternatively the player can also participate in smuggling.

When using the game alone, the player competes against an AI opponent. He sometimes attacks the player's trading stations which results in a fight scene in which the player has to place his cannons so they destroy the attacking ships during the automatic attack phase. There are also other similar sequences and random occurrences like weddings or disasters that may force the player to react. The game is completely menu driven and offers multiplayer for up to six people.</resource>

    <resource id="97e1bb2964f9ad8b9e4e924bd1c2e0fed0c16cca" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Hard Drivin' is a 3D arcade hit from Atari Games. You are in control of a high-performance sports car. Your objective is to race around the course as fast as possible and hit as many checkpoints as possible. If you hit a checkpoint you gain extra time to go farther. You will see traffic on the road both in your direction and coming down the opposite direction, so be careful when you pass... 

The course has two sections: speed track, and stunt track. Speed track is longer, but you can usually achieve higher speeds. Stunt track requires you to perform several stunts such as jumping bridges, driving through a loop, and so on. 

Crashing the car has no serious consequences and indeed shows a replay of your crash from a cinematic angle. Admire your crash head-on into the cement truck, or clipping the minivan, or flying off the bridge in the wrong angle... You lose several seconds as your car is &amp;quot;reset&amp;quot; and you get up to speed again. 

The home conversions retain most of the then-advanced 3D graphics but lack the force-feedback that was in the arcade version.

Not to be confused with me coin-op sequel Race Drivin, Hard Drivin II is a revision of the original simulator thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s never appeared in the arcades.

At first sight it looks almost exactly the same as HD1. Select the first track from the menu, and youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re plonked into the seat of a Ferrari F40, which actually looks more like a Lada, so youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll have to use your imagination a bit. The track looks strangely familiar, until you realise that it actually is the same as the original HD1 track. If you still want more tracks, you can design your own with the circuit editor.

On the matter of gameplay, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s indistinguishable from the original game. In other words, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s very slow running on anything below an A1200, to the point where it becomes frustratingly unresponsive. There isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t much competition in the car simulation field, but compared to its closest rival, Stunt Car Racer, HDII is far slower, more limited and loses out in the playability stakes by quite a margin. Even so, if youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve got an accelerated machine, donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t mind putting up with a few bugs; and donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t already have the first game, Hard Drivin II could provide a pleasant distraction for a few hours.</resource>

The tiny town of Sturgis, tucked away in the Black Hills of South Dakota, may seem an odd destination for a loud, greasy HellÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Angel like yourself, but in August Sturgis becomes a Mecca for about 80,000 bikers from all over the world.

The actual road section looks okay, but it gets a bit repetitive dodging obstacles in the road, passing cars and stopping hitchhikers. Of course, you can speed things up but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a pity thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no chase, once the cops see you, you automatically pull over for the fine. When you hit town you can have fun customising self and bike at the shop, ogling the digitised petrol pump lady and participating in one of the events.

Once youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve tried all five events, however, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s little else to see apart from some disappointing single-screen party scenes.</resource>

The game is presented from an isometric perspective, and presents the characters with a number of puzzles involving switches, jumps and climbs. The levels are 3 dimensional, and the characters must collect crowns as they progress. Objects can be picked up and manipulated as necessary.

    <resource id="595512b9a70ada3b512c36560c891bc1ab75dd4c" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Heart of China from Dynamix is the second adventure game from the company which is probably better known for flight sims like A10 Tank Killer and the infamous Red Baron. It puts the player into the boots of Ã¢â‚¬ËœLuckyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Jake Masters, an all-American hero who gets a mission to save a  rich manÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s kidnapped daughter from the hands of the local villain. It is a pointÃ¢â‚¬â„¢nÃ¢â‚¬â„¢click adventure game which merges a good story with beautiful graphics and stunning music.

Heart of China (HoC) has the same control system Dynamix pioneered in Rise of The Dragon (their first adventure game). HoC can be played either with mouse, keyboard or even with joystick. Only a few actions are available (look, operate, move) but this is supported with some clever inventory manipulation. Most of the scenes are viewed from a first person perspective through your characterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s eyes. The first person view means the locations and characters are usually presented with static hand drawn pictures with odd animation sequence here and there. The Amiga version has 32 colour graphics which, despite the low number of colours, manage to look clear and beautiful.

The interactive storyline in Heart of China is not linear - meaning there are several ways to  solve problems and that player actions affect the flow and the direction of the adventure. This also means there are several entirely different endings.

ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s very little to fault in this game. Some players might be put off by the fact that unlike in LucasArts adventures, the main character can die or the adventure can otherwise run into a dead end. The control system takes some learning. Also the arcade parts might annoy the adventure game purists.

Without doubt one of the finest adventure games on the Amiga. Heart of China combines quality graphics and sound with a funny and interesting storyline. It contains unique features like plot branches, a totally original control system and deep character interaction. Like Ã¢â‚¬ËœLuckyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Jake Masters likes to think about himself, this one is an Ace.</resource>

Anyone who then goes up against that God again however, deserves to have his arms and legs removed etc, etc. Well, Heimdall is just such a chap. Not happy with his success a few years ago, he has once again entered the isometric arena in search of thrills.

Heimdall 2 have improved features and presentation than Heimdall, offering a number of quests within quests, and an improved control system. Most tasks are based upon the age-old format of delivering the correct object to the correct character.

Heimdall 2 has some smashing graphics to keep you felling perky, not to mention just the right amount of arcade and puzzle extras, making it an exciting and absorbing game to play. Arcade action comes in the form of numerous baddies just begging to be run through with a large pointy stick, or better still, shot from a distance with your trusty bow and arrow. There are also plenty of objects to collect and exchange, while conversating with numerous non-hostile characters who give you handy hints on which object to pick up next.

Heimdall was on his own in the original game, but Core have taken pity on him in this version and he is now accompanied by a Valkyrie called Ursha. Unfortunately Ursha is somewhat lacking in the magic department, but she more makes up for this combat stakes.

Heimdall 2 really has to played to be fully appreciated. I could go on forever about it but I won't. Suffice to say there's enough here to keep you going for quite a while. Couple that with stonkingly good presentation and you've got something well worth taking home and introducing to your parents.</resource>

The player's job is to drive them out of the system. The game consists of six levels with two alternating gameplay mechanics. In the first, third and fifth level the player controls the mercenary himself who walks and jumps through the side-scrolling levels. With his weapon he shoots everything that moves and uses teleporters and holes to find his way. The other levels are horizontally shooters in a top-down perspective. The player controls a space ship, moves through the levels and shoots everything that moves. Killed enemies may leave symbols behind which give advantages when picked up.</resource>

The goal is to destroy a set amount of ground targets in each of the ten vertically scrolling levels. To do so, the player has to change the altitude of the space ship - but flying low creates the danger of crashing into another building. Fuel and shields can be replenished by flying over especially marked buildings. Of course there is also alien opposition which is dealt with by shooting them. Later levels introduce additional challenges like laser fences which have to be passed through with the correct timing.</resource>

I canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t say I was particularly impressed by Hellraider which is another run-of-the-mill shootÃ¢â‚¬â„¢em-up, with not a lot else to offer. The games manual is very large, and thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a huge section describing the story behind the game, but after youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve read it youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll do exactly the same as before, and shoot anything that isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t you. The controls are very awkward, and moving in to the right position to fire at something can become annoying.

The graphics is well defined, but rather small and boring due to the use of colour. The aliens are of a kind shot countless times before, and the game looks dated. The sound is minimal with the usual zaps and bangs but nothing oustanding. A nice piece of music on the title screen. 

WhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s worse, is that the gameplay is uninteresting and dull. Scooting around the planetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s surface soon gets repetitive, and attacking the odd alien base did nothing to relieve the tedium either. Basically, Hellraider is a very dull shootÃ¢â‚¬â„¢em-up that would be more suited to an 8-bit machine, and offers nothing new or original. Not something IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d rush out and buy.</resource>

    <resource id="ed2acedfb012742c7c28b3add6e65be2092e52e2" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">High Seas Trader is a Strategy game, developed and published by Impressions Games, which was released in Europe in 1995.

High Seas Trader from Impressions takes the same concept as Ã¢â‚¬ËœPirates!Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ and expands it further. It builds on the same basic elements offered in the aging MicroProse classic and adds more complex simulation of sea combat and trading. But does it beat Sid MeyerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s masterpiece?

The AGA version of High Seas Trader comes on four disks. A decent manual with Amiga technical supplement and a tutorial book is provided within the package. The game is hard disk installable.

The player takes the role of a merchant sea captain during the 17th and 18th centuries. The short term goal of the game is to profitably trade between various ports while managing your own ship. The long term goal is to rise within the ranks of the Merchant Guild with the ultimate goal of reaching the status of Viscount. Trade is a complex beast in this game. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a large quantity of commodities which can be sold around the world. As the prices change through time, players must very carefully plan the actions if he (or she) means to succeed in their selected career. This can get quite frustrating in the beginning but gets easier when the game progresses and the player gets more accustomed to the game world, tactics and politics.

In conclusion, High Seas Trader offers an entertaining mix of business sim and challenging sea combat simulation. Those who invest the time and effort will ultimately find the game a thrilling experience. To
the more impatient players who would like a taste of life at sea, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d recommend getting Ã¢â‚¬ËœPirates!Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ as it is generally easier for beginners to get into. But if you have played Ã¢â‚¬ËœPirates!Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ to the death and yearn for
similar but deeper challenges, you cannot go wrong with High Seas Trader.</resource>

There are two aspects to the game: arcade action, where the player performs tasks (expressed as mini-games) such as searching for treasure and traveling between locations, and adventure, where the player completes quests. The choice of character class affects the available quests, with three for each class. While the quests need to be completed in a set order, &amp;quot;what you do in your time off is up to you&amp;quot;.</resource>

Both players act simultaneously on a split screen. While one player can move his units, the other can attack and vice versa. The results of battles are shown in animated sequences.

Terrain affects the performance of units, and seasons affect the likely terrain. Different units are introduced as the game and war progress, with more air and sea battles later on.

There are 24 single-player maps in the game, which can be played from either the German or French perspective. In addition, there are 12  two-player maps.

The game also includes a lot of information about the period: after each mission, historical facts about two months of wartime are displayed.

One after another these strip poker games appear; sequels, updates, data disks, the only variations occuring in the quality of the graphics. Hollywood Poker was one of the first on the Amiga, and now Hollywood Poker Pro has arrived you can do it all over again.

It starts off well with a digitised silhouette of a girl dancing to some sampled music, rather like the title sequence of Tales of the Unexpected. When you have had enough of that you can choose to play against one of four girls. Once your opponent runs out of credits she sells an item of clothing for another 100 credits. If your balance falls below zero you lose the game.

The graphics are sharp, but if you want a close-up you can use the zoom feature which doubles the pixel size. A few slow tunes play in the background but are not the sort of thing you can bear for long.

Just like all the others, Hollywood Poker Pro is a good laugh with the boys, and once you have started you have to beat them all. When you have done that, and it wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t take long, I canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t see anyone coming back to it. I wont pretend I found it offensive, boring or tasteless. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just a good bit of fun, but a very short-lived bit of fun. I wouldn't bother with it too much, as it just doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t offer good value for the money. But itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s better than playing chess with your brother on a rainy day.</resource>

Kevin's family went on vacation, but they forgot about him, so now he's home alone. Now there are two burglars who want to break into the house. Kevin has to prevent the burglars from kidnapping him, by riddling the house with traps.

The player controls Kevin through the mansion in a side perspective. He has one hour before the burglars will break into the house. In this hour, the player has to set up various traps in order to make the burglars give up on capturing Kevin. After this hour, the burglars break in, and the traps become active. Each trap deals 5 damage to a burglar, and the first shot of Kevin's BB gun deals another 5. During this phase, the screen always tells in which room each burglar is at the moment. The game is won by dealing 50 damage to each burglar.</resource>

Another could-have-been-OK Hannah-Barberra release from Hi-Tec; for a budget game this would be quite respectable if weren't for the sluggish controls which render it pretty much unplayable -- there's a huge delay between moving the joystick up and Hong Kong jumping, which makes for frustrating gameplay: even with the cheat you'd have to have the patience of a saint to play this for too long. A pity, as the music is quite catchy and the graphics aren't bad.</resource>

It's a point and click adventure, and the pirate setting ensures that it recalls the Monkey Island games. The top 2/3 of the screen features a visual depiction of the area Peter is in, which a row of icons along the bottom can be selected to alter the function of a mouse click. These include looking at an object, picking it up, talking to people, using objects to solve problems (often in combination with others), and giving objects to others.

I mean They sure as hell donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t scare anybody and nine times out of ten theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re decidedly mediocre anyway. This is certainly true of the awesomely below-average Horror Zombies from the Crypt, a game that supposedly pays homage to the classic horror flicks of yesteryear. In it you play a hapless hero who stumbles into a creepy mansion in the dead of night (oh yes, because that sort of thing happens all the time) and then has to try and escape. 

Naturally this unlikely scenario manifests itself into a scrolling arcade adventure with the baddies all extras from various generic cinematic shockers. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve got zombies, vampires, frankensteins stumbling about after youÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s all quite predictable really. The basic object is to avoid these meanies (or, better yet, kill them with your throwing knives), explore the various levels, collect keys and objects, unlock doors... you know the sort of thing. There are some vague platform elements - many items of furniture can be climbed and jumped on, and in some cases moved about.

If anything, Horror Zombies is best compared to something like The Addams Family - although this canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t dare to hold a candle to OceanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s classic platformer. Here the action is stunted, slow and unexciting. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s very little to hold your attention, and the rather gratuitous death sequence (your head blows up unconvincingly), little effort has gone into trying to make the game anything like the horror movies itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s supposed to be a tribute to. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not totally unplayable, but it lacks imagination, hasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t been very well put together and as a result comes across as one of the most mediocre games weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve seen in a good few months. Buy something else instead.</resource>

The chief element of strategy centres on the base complex where you find yourself on the receiving end of a massive invasion. The eight-legged moonbase has just been through an earthquake which has cracked the walls. Insect aliens are pouring through these breaches by the dozen, heading towards the control room. If they get there, all hell will break loose, and your game will be over.

In short, Hostile Breed is an eight level shoot-em-up, but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s laid out in such a way that you can get to any level whenever you like. The control centre is a vital piece of the jigsaw, and devoted shoot-em-up fans might at first find this a bit too much for them to handle.

The Ã¢â‚¬Ëœin-betweenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ scenes and the death-screen are pleasing, but not great, while the in-game sprites are vaguely cartoon-like. The sound effects are raunchy enough, but there are quite as many as youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d probably like to give you the real atmosphere. 

You have to hand it to Palace, Hostile Breed is not your ordinary shoot-em-up. If you want a bit of Ã¢â‚¬ËœthinkÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and your Ã¢â‚¬ËœshootÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re opposed to mind violence (but not plain olÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ everyday violence), go for it. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll enjoy it.</resource>

    <resource id="dee7d0b5c54ec065837adc4a4003ec3dc1d54ba8" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Hot Rod is a top-view racing game influenced by Super Sprint, in which three miniature cars race to complete a race as quickly as possible, by rotating, accelerating and braking at the right moments. You start with limited fuel, but more can be collected as you cover the track. Hitting hazards can cause your car to explode, thus costing time as it is replaced.

Unusually the racetracks are linear rather than lap-based, so each round involves covering a section of track once. After each race, you can purchase upgrades at the shop, depending on how much money you earned in the previous race.

Only part of the circuit is shown at a time, and this scrolls following the leader. If you fail to keep up with this, your car is moved forward on the track, with a penalty fuel deduction. This is slightly similar to the system later used in head-to-head games of Micro Machines, and is especially punishing while you are on roads travelling horizontally and the leading CPU car is travelling vertically, as it makes the margin for error much smaller.

Grand Prix 500 2 is your standard bike racing scenario, featuring a handful of riders racing hell for leather around the most famous courses of the world, pausing only to collect medals and shake champagne all over each other.

I must admit, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m a very big fan of bike racing games. From Team Suzuki to Super Hang On, I always have my eye out for a new one. This is quite definitely the most appalling one I have ever seen. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s completely unplayable in every respect, with a useless two player mode and some of the smallest player windows ever seen.

You begin as always on the starting grid and at this point things look really good. The graphics are fine and detailed and everything looks fairly realistic. Then the light turns green and the other riders hit the horizon in about three hops. Push forward to get moving and you hit this gameÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s big problem. Rather than have you at the centre of the screen with the road swinging around as you change lanes, the programmers obviously decided that that was too much hassle, and opted for the other side of the coin, which involves the road being centred and the sprite of the bike moving around unrealistically. The result of this is that itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s impossible to judge corners correctly, and as for overtaking - forget it.

This is one useless game. Even as a budget title, it just isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t worth the disk itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s recorded on.</resource>

The aim of the game is to destroy your own bricks before your opponent can destroy his. This is achieved by catching the small by pointing your suction device at it and holding fire, and then releasing in the needed by letting go of the button. This is easier said than done, as the ball neither moves in a straight line or according to the natural rules of.gravity.

Should either player be hit with the ball and not catch it properly, they will be knocked down and possession of the ball is passed to the other player.

In the game of the film of Tom Clanceys novel, Marko Ramius  commander of Russias most powerful nuclear submarine, The Red October Ã¢has been tempted by the Wests good life and hes going in his sub! The Russians are a bit annoyed about this ad decide to sink him. However, Ramius does get some help from CIA operative Jack Ryan who sets up a plan to sneak the sub into the US. Meanwhile, the Octobers chef, Loginov, is missing his vodka and caviar and gets angry enough to threaten to explode the subs nuclear warheads unless it turns around. At the end, Jack will have a final chance to save the day in a Cabal-style screen, taking pot shots at the chef who dodges between the warheads, returning fire.

Games standard movie approach, using a familiar main game-style with a couple of sub-games recreating key scenes has been copied by Grandslam to little effect. Unambitious horizontal sub sections but the 3-D for the helicopter drop and mini-sub scenes is fast and well executed. Sound consists of variety of atmospheric tunes, but weak rendition of movie soundtrack.

The Hunt for Red October: The Movie Amiga game veers towards high difficulty in places, with an amazingly restrictive sub section, and then throws in some attractively done but laughably simple 3-D sequences. If you want a game of the film then buy the game of the book  far better FMV.</resource>

But when the government of Hydra has asked for your help in defeating Hydra's enemies by couriering parts to a secret weapon, and those enemies know you're coming... well then, life gets interesting.

Race down narrow swamp lanes to deliver parts of a secret weapon to bases at the finish of each section.  Enemies will be shooting at you, but you can shoot back with Uzi Cannons and Nukes.  Collect crystals along the way to boost your speed or shields.

The training as fighter pilot for the Federation took five years. Now you are finished. But there is a final test to master: survive the 'Hyperdome'.

The player is thrown in the Hyperdome with his space ship, the landscape is scrolling horizontally, and to survive, you have to shoot everything in sight. Your ship is equipped with a basic laser cannon. Luckily, some opponents drop collectible markers, which increase a counter visible on the right side of the screen. If you reached the weapon or bonus of your choice, you can activate it. There are nine extras available: increased ship speed, increased fire power, double fire, missiles, spread (clears in front), homing missiles, a satellite and a shield. If you loose one of your initially nine lives, the current extra weapon is gone. If you collect too many items without activating a weapon, the count is set back to the first bonus.

Of course, your ship is crashing if the landscape blocks are touched - this is integral part of the design, as some levels build up less on shooting, but avoiding and securely navigating through the many obstacles on the way.</resource>

Contested by two teams of eleven players each, cricket is a very technical bat-and-ball game played on a grass oval-shaped field, in the centre of which are a flat strip of ground, called a cricket pitch, and two wooden wickets placed at each end of the pitch. The bowler, a player from the fielding team, bowls a hard, fist-sized cricket ball from the vicinity of one wicket towards the other. The ball usually bounces once before reaching the batsman, a player from the opposing team. In defence of the wicket, the batsman plays the ball with a wooden cricket bat. Meanwhile, the other members of the bowler's team stand in various positions around the field as fielders, players who retrieve the ball in an effort to stop the batsman scoring runs, and if possible to get him or her out. The batsman ? if he or she does not get out ? may run between the wickets, exchanging ends with a second batsman (the &amp;quot;non-striker&amp;quot;), who has been waiting near the bowler's wicket. Each completed exchange of ends scores one run. Runs are also scored if the batsman hits the ball to the boundary of the playing area. The match is won by the team that scores more runs. Choosing between a bowler, or a batsman, game player defines the role of its team. During the match game player may control all his team players, nearest to the ball to achieve the main goal. Power, direction, and the moment should be used properly to achieve it more successfully. Eight countries (England, New Zealand, Australia, Sri Lanka, South Africa, India, West Indies, and Pakistan) are available to select and game player/players may be appointed either to CPU, which has a three difficulty levels, or to human.</resource>

Pretty decent Lode Runner variant in which you evade colour swapped clones of your player sprite, collect fruit, and then try to escape the level. I think the playability of Ice Runner is just right. On the other hand, the game lacks variety: There is only a single tile set for level graphics and there is only a single track of background music. The samples can get annoying after a while, too. You might want to turn off your Amiga's speakers and turn on some relaxing music from your stereo instead.</resource>

At the end we will have to enter the fortress of Arkhon to destroy the generator of a infernal time machine. We can obtain 14 power-ups like Speed Down/Up and several types of improvements for the shot. The most effective are the triple trigger as Bustar, Doolyx, Jaxtorys, Leitun or Kyus.

Or not, as this is a standard platform game with a twist of questionable taste and purpose. 

You play a crash test dummy, trying to progress through levels filled with hazards such as cars and fireballs, within the time limits. Contact with each of these loses you a limb, and once you have none left, contact means game over. Since the character isn’t handicapped by missing limbs in any way, in practical terms you can think of these as hit points  especially as there are screwdrivers to pick up which restore one limb.

There are even some adventure-game elements, such as Indy's inventory which you can fill with various objects to use (i.e. money to buy things). They are mostly easy though, and are there only to relieve the tension from knuckle-blistering action.</resource>

This makes for a four-level arcade adventure combining climbs, exploration (with several routes through each level, and some traps) and puzzles. Indy is armed with his trusty whip to fight off foes, but can also get involved in hand-to-hand combat. The first level takes place in caves underneath Colorado, before you reach a moving circus train strewn with traps, a Zeppelin which is full of guards and ladders, and then Castle Grunwald in Austria.</resource>

As Indy, the player must complete several cycles of the following three types of levels:

Mine level: Whip your way through a mine in order to free children that are held captive. Use your whip to swing across chasms, climb ladders, ride along conveyor belts and defend yourself against attacks from Thuggee guards, bats, snakes and the fireball-throwing Mola ram. Escape with the mine cart after you've freed all children.
    
Mine cart level: Pick the right route through a network of tracks while riding in a mine cart. Avoid potholes, broken tracks &amp; guards in carts and safely reach the end of the track.
    
Temple level: Make your way to the altar and grab the Sankara stone while Mola Ram, bats and Thuggee guards attack you. Watch out for that lava.</resource>

You play Jack, a young kid who loves drawing in a book the adventures of his imaginary friend Indigo. But Indigo gets trapped for some reason inside the book. It leaves no other choice to Charley but to go inside his own worlds in the hope of rescuing his friend.

Indigo is a platformer where the objective is to reach the end of each level within the time limit. To open the exit, you have to find all the keys. The number of keys left is displayed in the bottom right corner of the screen. Some of the keys can be found on monsters.

Controls are simple. You can walk left and right. Jump by pushing the joystick upward. While jumping, press fire to go into attack stance and land on monsters to stun them. You can then bounce on the monster until he awakens or kill him by attacking again. You can also stand beside the monster and press fire to grab him. Press fire to throw him at enemies. Some monsters can't be stunned. Also, a thrown monster will make every hidden bonus appear in its path.

There are a variety of power ups you can find throughout the game. The remaining active time gauge is displayed in the top left corner.

Author, Stephane Belin said: Indigo does not pretend to be the greatest game but I had a very good time creating it. I hope you'll enjoy it for what it is.</resource>

Starting in the corners, players take it in turns to place a marker of their colour on the grid. An existing marker can be moved two places away, or a new marker can be created within one space of a player's existing marker. If the marker is placed directly next to an opponent's marker, it will take over that marker's position. The game finishes either when the board is full (the player with the most markers wins) or there is only one player with markers left on the board (having taken over all other markers). 

Up to four players can take part, and they can either be human controlled or CPU controlled. There are nine different board layouts, some featuring barriers dividing parts of the board.</resource>

Superhero Kal Solar is the only one who can prevent a catastrophe, and that's where you come in.

The game is viewed in 3D from Solar's perspective, with a full HUD built into his helmet showing direction, health and supplies. Other HUDs also allow you to check whether the current air is breathable (you have limited oxygen), as well as one built into your Jetpack.

There are two movement modes, one of which allows you to pan the view and the other allows you to shoot. Objects have to be picked up and used, computers operated, and an infra-red kit located and used. To win the game you will have to destroy all the eggs, and then shut the compound down and escape in time.

Her beloved home village Little Moaning is earmarked for a yuppie-friendly transformation by Jasper Quickbuck of Ridley's Manor.

Ingrid has three cunning plans to stop him - producing a petition with everybody's signature, finding a more orthodox prevention method, and finally infiltrating Ridley's Manor itself by pretending to be a maid, and then finding proof that he's a dodgy geezer who should be locked up. These three quests can be played in any order, although they logically follow on from each other. She is accompanied by Flopsy the dog in the first 2 parts, and her cousin Daisy in the third.

Ingrid's Back! uses the same game system as the original, and other contemporary Level 9 titles such as Knight Orc . Giving instructions to other characters (including Flopsy) and jumping around the map using GO TO and FOLLOW commands. A living and breathing world of people travelling, trading and relaxing underpins it all, and plays a part in most puzzles.</resource>

You have been sent to the Interchange, a highly sensitive area, which has been invaded by Victor Virus and his gang of bugs. On 50 circuits they have changed the direction of some of the blocks on each circuit and your task is to straighten them all back up. Viewed from above with each circuit shown on screen you must walk along the circuits to the misaligned pieces and turn them back round to the correct position and a ping sounds when it is in the correct position. As you sort the circuit some of Victor's bugs roam the circuits as well and you can either avoid them, shoot them with limited balls or turn a piece of circuit round when they are next to it to destroy them. Once all the bugs have been destroyed they don't reappear. If you touch a bug, fall through a gap or fall of the edge of the circuit then you lose one of five lives and when all lives are gone it is game over. There is a password provided after every five levels to stop you repeating too many circuits. There is also a clock counting down and the circuit must be completed within the time. Occasionally some items appear to help you and these are extra balls, smart bomb, shield (limited), extra speed, freeze all bugs, extra time and stop timer.</resource>

The goal obviously is to reach the top of the league which is achieved by winning matches against other teams. If the own team has possession of the puck, the player can start a shot by holding the fire button - the longer kept, the more power goes into the shot. When in defense, the player can choose between two control methods: either manual cycling through the athletes or the game automatically switches to the one nearest to the puck. Other options include the strategy (athlete positioning), three difficulty levels, the time per period (two, five or twenty minutes) and if the highlights of the game should be replayed after each third. Offside and icing are ignored.</resource>

Real teams are provided at both club and national level - although, contrary to what the packaging claimed, the player names are invented. The players vary in speed, and in which skills (such as heading, overhead kicks, close control and shooting) they are competent in. Running with the ball generally works better than passing. Plenty of tournaments are offered, as is the chance to edit team data and kits. One advantage it has over the original Sensible Soccer is onscreen referees and linesmen.</resource>

This explains the apparently slow, jerky scrolling and rickety collisions, as this is how real trucks handle. There are 6 trucks in each race, which take place across famed international circuits. Every couple of laps you must refuel, which is done by driving into the pits and collecting the flag in your car's colour. The top 3 finishers in each race score points, and you must finish in the top 3 to progress to the next round.</resource>

As you may have guessed from the title however, EagleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Nest is a World War II based game, and concerns the heroic deeds of an Allied Commando, fighting hordes of German Stormtroopers. The graphics are bold and colourful, and the characters themselves are much larger than those in similar games like the Gauntlet and Garrison series, or indeed those from Alien Breed.

Using the joystick you guide your character through the maze of corridors in the castle, finding various useful objects like ammunition, keys, health, elevator passes, etc. You will frequently see a long line of Germans lined up in an adjacent corridor, just waiting for you to unlock a connecting door, which will allow them to attack you.

Unfortunately though, the game, which promises to be a fun and action filled romp, fails to deliver and will probably be abandoned after only a few minutes of play. The problem is one of tedium. Its just dull. Very little skill is required to massacre huge numbers of the enemy soldiers, and simply standing your ground and holding the fire button is usually sufficient to pack droves of them off to the great Reich in the sky. The sound is very limited, and the scrolling is somehow reminiscent of an early Psygnosis game; highly dodgy, and apparently not making efficient use of the AmigaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s purpose built hardware.

I may have missed some source of appeal within the game, but I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t see what. Its just so lacking in inspiration. In short, avoid the game - unless you feel you simply have to witness it for yourself.</resource>

In your quest you will encounter Mutant Appendages that will drag you into the murky depths of the swamp; fences, walls, barriers, and traps which you must avoid; primitive natives, and wild animals; police vehicles and Urban Warriors who will stop at nothing to catch and kill you. The game is third-person racing action arcade, where the player controls a Quad and shoots the enemies with the weapon chosen for it. Gameplay is available for one or two players. In two players mode the screen is split on two sides, and each player may play in cooperative or competitive mode.</resource>

    <resource id="75d6ec80fae86fc67ab422c9f442f67da6f08626" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">The first game in the series came out in 1992 on Amiga, Atari ST and DOS. It takes place on the island of Kendoria. At the beginning, the player controls a warrior called Aramir, and he must defeat Krogh, an evil sorcerer who has killed lord Jarel. The game takes its name from Krogh's fortress, Ishar, whose name means &amp;quot;unknown&amp;quot; in the game's fictional elf language. In order to achieve this, the player's characters must travel across the whole island and, among other things, meet with the surviving companions of Jarel.

Most of Ishar takes place in an outdoor environment, which was original for computer roleplaying games of the time. It also featured a unique system to change the lineup of player characters: the player can have up to five characters at the same time, but each one will like or dislike his comrades. These preferences come into play when the player tries to recruit or dismiss a character, because the other characters will then vote for or against the recruitment or dismissal. If a character cannot be dismissed by a vote, it is possible for the player to have him assassinated by another character, but there is a risk that other characters will murder the murderer himself, possibly creating a chain of murders that slays the whole party but one.

This opus was the only one of the series that had gold removed from the party each time the player saved.

The band Summoning used the cover art of the game for their album Minas Morgul.</resource>

    <resource id="c46662ad401fc7fd78093786a448113b790d8ae3" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">The sequel to Ã¢â‚¬ËœIshar: Legend Of the FortressÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ takes up the story long after the destruction of Krogh, by Aramir and his companions - including KroghÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own mother, the witch Morgula! The former Fortress of Ishar became the new growth epicentre for the Aborean archipelago - The Isle of Kendoria and diverse islands named after JarelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s companions where another evil lord arose - Shandar. Zubaran, IsharÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s current Ruler,  hears of this. So, naturally, Shandar must be found and destroyed. This is the ultimate object of the game.

The SilmarilsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ standard of graphics and gameplay is sustained, and in parts improved upon, in this evolved creation of a larger and more involved fantasy world. Additions to this game include the introduction of topography. There is a greater variety of characters and creatures and everything is, again, nicely drawn, but the animation remains Ã¢â‚¬ËœstaticÃ¢â‚¬â„¢.

You start out alone, broke etc., but you have the option of using your team from Ã¢â‚¬ËœIshar 1Ã¢â‚¬â„¢. There is a map in this game which, unlike its predecessor, actually shows your position, plus indications of places to go/avoid. This sequel does rely more heavily on precursive tasks, and, unfortunately in this way, does tend towards the linear - but, not in an obvious, precognitive, or boring, way.

Overall? Quite a romp! Escapist adventure, or what?! Less uneventful/aimless wandering than either predecessor, but you need an eagle-eye to pick up on some things, even from the start. Difficulty level?  Not novice, you need a bit of experience.  Not as dull/predictable/frustrating/unimaginative as one or two other RPGs I could mention. Have fun!</resource>

In each geographic area you will have different problems, interlaced within a series of &amp;quot;custom pictures&amp;quot; which gather part of Europe and North  Africa as they were in the first century BC. It was the time of the Roman Empire splendor, their legions extend and dominate the known world, but in each one of their provinces the inhabitants breathe freedom and make their own rules, codes and rituals. In Hispania, Jabato became a legendary figure, prototype of the implacable hero in the fight against the evil but with a great heart. In this history you will assume the role of this fabulous personage. 

But it won't be easy: instead of living one of his moments of greatness, you will incarnate a defeated Jabato, without friends, prisoner in a dirty Roman jail with the bitter feeling that his beloved Claudia is captive in a distant land. Your final mission will be to avoid that her could be sacrificed by the fanatical sect of the Egyptian sub-world. For it, on the first part, you must liberate yourself from the Roman yoke and search for company. Multiple adventures are awaiting you soon in the Galia and Hispania. The second part begins in Cesarea, in which you must enter in the heart of Africa and obtain the keys that could allow you to survive in the lands of the mythical tombs, sacred Pharaohs and great mysteries. If you survive, you will fight the final battle against the terrible forces of the dark wisdom.

Three different ball speeds, variable match lengths and an 'easy' mode are on offer. Different tournament types are on offer, at 'club' and 'tournament' levels, with a customisable ladder system of multiple divisions to rise up. There is a full roster of opponents to play in one-off or tournament modes.</resource>

Pond has been armed with an Inspector Gadget-style stretch device, which he can use to view higher areas or claw onto ceilings so as to slide across them.

The gameplay takes place across worlds themed around particular types of toys, such as sporting goods, candy and aircraft. The levels scroll sideways, although a small amount of vertical movement is included. On each level Pond must collect 2 penguins and reach the exit, although there are usually multiple exits and lots of secret areas to explore. After completing each pair of two worlds (each of which has three sub levels), a boss must be faced.</resource>

Pond can run very quickly (by holding down the A button) through large levels, which often contain steep mountain sides and other tricky areas. Once again, he has to oppose the evil scientist Maybe and his minions.</resource>

The Mayor is keeping an eye on you, and wants the job done as quickly and cheaply as possible.

Unfortunately, the main weapon which must be used to finally kill Jaws has been broken into four pieces, which are located along the sea bed in different places. As you explore the 150-plus screens of the game, you must shoot the other fish - some can be shot using your standard weapon, while others (those which flash) must be shot using special limited bullets.

You also have responsibility for closing beaches, which removes the risk of a shark attack, but also costs the area business, especially on hot days, and irritates the Mayor.</resource>

It was the only official sequel to Jet Set Willy, one of the most successful and popular home computer games ever released. Officially, Jet Set Willy II: The Final Frontier is the last of the Miner Willy series, although numerous unofficial sequels, remakes, homages and updates have been released, even up to this day.

Jet Set Willy II is an expansion of the original JSW rather than a new game unto itself. Its map is primarily an expanded version of the original mansion, with only a few new elements over its predecessor, several of which are based on rumoured events in JSW that were in fact never programmed (such as being able to launch the titular ship in the screen called &amp;quot;The Yacht&amp;quot; and explore an island). In some versions Willy is blasted from the Rocket Room into space, and for these 33 rooms he dons a spacesuit.</resource>

Bearing these in mind one wonders whatever possessed the Hi-Tec peeps to release this with the word Ã¢â‚¬ËœgameÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ anywhere on the disk or packaging. Fair enough it does pass the time, but then so does a party political broadcast. This, not to put too fine a point on it, is pretty tedious stuff indeed.



Initial impressions are more favourable, however. You canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t deny The Jetsons looks pretty much like youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d expect Hanna-BarberaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s family of second- string cartoon characters to look, but decent-enough- cartoony-graphics is about as far as its list of good points goes. To be honest, the list of bad points is equally short - thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no gameplay to speak of here at all. All that happens is, one after another, members of our 1950s-style space family explore a boring space-age maze, dodging dull traps and picking up the odd even-more-boring collectables. Obviously Hi-Tec thought that the graphics and animation were ample to sell this as a Ã¢â‚¬ËœgameÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and, indeed, I dare say theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll sell quite a few on the name alone. DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t let one of them be you - not least because theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve got the cheek to charge a distinctly un-budget thirteen quid for it.</resource>

They were swiftly halted in their tracks when they received a top level order warning of a massive campaign of bribery of government officials in all countries. It appeared that any overt attempt to destroy SPUDD would result in the downfall of most of the world's governments. SPUDD-controlled leaders would soon rise to replace them.

As the situation has worsened by the day, and SPUDD's forces have grown from strength to strength, the various agencies have now put together an underground task force which they hope will combat the growing threat. This elite task force comprises one agent (yourself - nice of you to volunteer by the way), a highly trained mechanic called Harry, and a field support officer to assign missions. The plan is that you will &amp;quot;borrow&amp;quot; aircraft from local air forces and carry out secret strike missions on SPUDD forces while they are still small enough to have to stay hidden. Hopefully, by damaging their supply lines, factories and control centres, you should be able to ruin their plans of world domination. However, if you wreck too many expensive aircraft, your sponsors will not be able to cover for you, resulting in your sent back to the secret agent's Basic Training School.

In Jetstrike you must stop the devious SPUDD forces by attacking them with your &amp;quot;borrowed&amp;quot; aircraft. Your Commanding Officer will give you a mission objective which you have to try to achieve without being shot down, blown up or crashing into mountains.

Jetstrike is an 2D side-scrolling action game like Brøderbund’s Wings of Fury. The great difference between these games is, in Jetstike it’s possible to use 32 aircraft and 6 helicopters in several combat-missions or to be a part of the Aerolympics.

Originally conceived in 1983 by Level 9 as the Middle-Earth trilogy, the standalone 8-bit releases of Colossal Adventure, Adventure Quest and Dungeon Adventure were enhanced and published in this renamed compilation Jewels of Darkness.

The Amiga version is the update of the original text-only Middle Earth Trilogy. Jewels of Darkness enhances the original text-only incarnations released for 8-bit platforms by adding graphics, more extensive text descriptions, an extended parser that understands many more commands and other user-friendly features. The subsequent games in this trilogy are full of illogical puzzles and paper-thin plots, although Dungeon Adventure does add a D&amp;D style magic system to make it more interesting. These games originally had references to Lords of the Ring novels that were later removed, possibly to avoid charges of copyright infringement.</resource>

And you need a change of luck, because events in this game often emphasise the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune. You get hit by a car, fall a great height, sprayed with cheese sandwich and more! Being the guinea pig in this strange world will drive you insane - if this jinxed land doesn't do it first. 

Jinxter is an interactive fiction with graphics title that takes a realistic world of people and situations, and then plays with the boundaries to create a strange and puzzling world. Characters are all getting on with their own tasks, and getting them to help you is usually a case of making sure something's in it for them.

Dialogue aims to add a comic touch to proceedings. Puzzles can often be solved in multiple ways, but the most obvious way is not always the correct one. Due to the presence of a Guardian, you can't actually die.

The screens are linked in various ways, and contain a number of keys which must be used correctly.

    <resource id="1147a6539d34271c14d1aa556e67277798f1191a" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">As Players Software correctly predicted, London in 1995 is an unfriendly unsafe city ran by thugs. Innocent civilians who leave the house will almost certainly face violence. An acclaimed hero since his successes in the original, Joe Blade is the man to put things right - if he can kill 100 thugs and rescue 20 civilians within ten minutes, the thugs will retreat and the city will be saved.

As Joe, you must move through the streets and kill these thugs, by kicking them in the head (they have body armour). As in the first game, the streets are flick-screen and have many doorways linking them. Rescuing civilians involves touching them before completing a sub-game within a minute.

There are four subgame variants of increasing difficulty, all based around a 1-2-3-4 sequence of numbers. The first involves simply stopping the cursor as each one appears in order - pressing the wrong one sends you back to having to find a 1. In the second, the numbers are on screen in random order, a cursor cycling through them - press fire to swap the two numbers currently highlighted. In the third, you are presented with two jumbled sets and must put one of them in order, by swapping numbers across the two sets. In the fourth, you must form the sequence by swapping an ever-changing number into the right place, by pressing fire at the right moment.

Game play modes include regular season, playoffs and sudden death. The game features 16 regular teams plus one All-Madden team, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. Play actions include selecting a pass recipient as a play unfolds, block tackles, dives and sackings. Different weather conditions come into play when it's wet, snowy or muddy.

    <resource id="b53c0ef94b97c44587161bede756449412124835" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">German small-town quietness erupts in a whirl of obscure horror, aggression and uninhibited sexuality as an ancient force stirs and warps minds. As Kronstadt drifts into chaos in the course of eleven days in November, a teenager bound to the wheelchair dabbles in Celtic mysticism and discovers his talent for magic. Bourgeois bliss, late-80’s youth culture, occultism and photorealistic nudity mix into a psychedelic nightmare that stands out as the most perplexing German adventure game.

The successor to Holiday Maker and Stadt der Löwen, and Phoenics’ (formerly PM Entertainment) third (and last) adventure game, Jonathan was a child of the dusk of Germany’s vibrant Amiga scene, where a maximum of finesse met a new minimum of public interest. 

Jonathan is unconventional to the brink of schizophrenia, both in style and gameplay. The actual adventure actions in a colorless, messy interface are contrasted with the sumptuous high-res artworks of the frequent cutscenes. Many of these revolve around the members of the protagonist Jonathan’s clique, who are essential to the game – the disabled young man must rely on their help to do things he is unable to do. 

As the game switches perspective and explores the minds of Jonathan’s friends, it focuses on their sexuality with a unabashed bluntness that should have shocked the pampered German audience, had anyone bought it.

You play the Judge as he tries to attempt six missions of crime. Once a mission is completed there is a bonus level related to the last mission to attempt. Take too long to complete a mission and the crime rate rises. Let the rate get too high and it's game over. To aid the Judge you have various weapons to fire and also your Lawmaster bike. This allows you to move around faster but you can't fire your weapon or arrest people thus making the crime rate rise. Judge Dredd is a side view platform game that scrolls as you move left or right. Pressing the space bar allows you to change from walking to riding your bike. The joystick controls your character while the fire button shoots your weapon.</resource>

There are theoretically more than 9 levels; I say ?theoretically? because the 9th one appears to be impossible. The landscapes are always 5 squares wide, and while many of these are just standard squares, there are several different types, differentiated by colour. There are black holes which cause the ball to drop, costing you valuable time, although you get a limited number of jumps on each level, which are accessed by pressing fire. Yellow squares speed the ball up, while red slows it down. Green causes the ball to stick and be immovable until it clears that section, purple reverses the left and right control, while blue gives a free jump (be careful not to miss the next jump pads while in the air though). Points are given depending on how far you progress in each level, and how quickly you complete it.</resource>

Problems you face include pollution, collisions with other asteroids, worker discontent and alien unrest. Battles against the aliens indigenous to the area must be fought, making building and maintaining a space fleet a priority.

Sent to investigate the mysterious death of a private detective, Rukov quickly uncovers a nefarious plot by top-level KGB generals to oust President Gorbachev.

Players take the role of Rukov in 1st person perspective. The game features a Point and Click interface and the ability to rewind to review scenes for important clues.

In the enhanced CD-ROM version: Conspiracy, the famous actor Donald Sutherland stars as Rukov's father and voices the part in the help sections of the game.

The early medieval setting and fantasy themes resemble &amp;quot;Asterix &amp; Obelix&amp;quot;.

Kajko i Kokosz is a classic point &amp; click adventure game, based on a popular Polish comic book series featuring the same characters. You can switch between the two characters at will, and some actions have to be done with a specific character. The controls are pretty simple - to interact with the environment, you just have to click. You have a limited space in your inventory, but you can take an object from your inventory and drop it anywhere at any time. The game graphics feature original artwork created by the creator of the series, Janusz Christa, thus retaining the &amp;quot;look &amp; feel&amp;quot; of the comic books.

Each race is of a varying number of laps depending on the track's length and complexity. Sound effects have been sampled, giving the game a realistic sound unusual at the time.</resource>

This is a single player RPG more aimed at a novice. Your job is to clear out all the monsters infesting the cellars, dungeons and dark corners of Maramon.

You can chose your character at the beginning of the game. You can be either a huntsman, blacksmith, courier or a scholar. Each has slightly different abilities and all come in handy at some point. You start in the town of Maramon where you are the local sheriff, you might say. Your job is to protect the town from the monsters that come out at night. You can go to different locations, but I suggest you go and equip yourself first - so buy some weapons and armor. Both cost money, but youll get paid on a regular basis for providing your services. Also, and conveniently, monsters will leave little money pouches behind. But where do all these ¢ monsters come from? They come from the very towers that are in the city! Each night the monsters stream from one tower to cause mayhem in the town. HereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a tip: they always attack the same target on the same day. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s your job to stop and kill them before they kill you - or anyone else.

This game is best described as the ¢ version of far better-known Magic Candle series. Mindcraft seems to be targeting the RPG newbies with simplified RPG engine and statistics-- instead of 4 characters, now you control only one. Combat and spellcasting are also not terribly exciting. Still, like OriginÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Tangled Tales, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a commendable (and underappreciated) effort to expand the RPG market.</resource>

Whereas the original game only featured national teams, this version allows the player to take control of all club teams from the top divisions of five European countries: England, Germany, France, Italy and Spain. For each country a league or a cup can be played and there is also a European cup with teams from all countries as well as individual friendlies. The European cup and friendlies also allow the player to select teams from other countries. For copyright reasons, all player names are misspelled (for example Barcelona features Rommario, Haggi and Coeman). The names can however be edited.

There are also some changes to the gameplay. This includes changes to the control systems to make it playable with a one button joystick (on Amiga) and new sound effects (for example when goals are scored) and improved graphics with more animations. Another addition is special key players that bring special playing styles to their sides.</resource>

    <resource id="952a766e12072ccf70e1b1b57abddb608bd1659e" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Kid Chaos is transported from the stone age into an unknown world by evil scientists from the future. Now he must fight his way through artificial environments such as the Secret Garden, Toxic Wasteland, Toy Factory, Techno Fortress, and the Ruined City to reach the time machine that can transport him back home.

Kid does this by running through the level, destroying all wildlife and several destruction targets, then leave the level by the exit door, which remain closed until Kid has destroyed all destruction targets. He destroys by swinging his club in the air and hitting them. He can also whiz if he's running fast, which enable him to discover hidden passages through walls that usually contain apples and power-ups. These are also found if Kid manages to jump really high in the air and lands on a platform that usually lead to secret passages.

There are five levels and four sections to complete in all of them (a total of twenty levels) and Kid start each level with three lives. During the level, if he loses health just by touching wildlife, or if the time expires, he is warped out of the level, loses a life, and has to restart the level at the checkpoints he passes through. His health can be restored either by waiting for the health meter to reach 99 (the boring way) or collecting apples (the smart way), but as Kid progresses further throughout the game, these apples become rare as well as his destruction targets. 

Once he leaves a level, Kid is given a statistics screen, telling him the percentage of destruction he has caused, how much wildlife he has killed, how many apples he collected, and other extras. These &amp;quot;extras&amp;quot; probably include how much more of his destruction targets he broke beyond the requirement.

As mentioned earlier, if Kid jumps really high to reach a platform, he can get power-ups, giving him such wonderful things like extra lives, extra time, or extra health. He can also collect a life token. If he manages to find three life tokens within the same section, then he is awarded an extra life as well.

Every fourth level, Kid will be faced with a challenge, and the object of these is usually to kill something, but there's always a catch for these challenges. For example, in Toy Factory, he has to shoot teddy bears at least ten times to blow them up, while avoiding shooting at ducks; and in Techno Fortress, he's presented with a game similar to Space Invaders, but only this time, there are no barriers. 

Kid Chaos starts off easily, but the further he progresses in the game, the higher the damage factor. Early in the game, he is allowed to hit so much wildlife before he loses a life, but as he progresses through each level, he can't afford to be hit not even once. Some levels in the game are quite tricky. Some levels require him to race through the level under a very strict time limit, while others contain a huge destruction target and he can't afford to miss any of these targets.

The game uses a password system, that allows you to resume at the start of each level. In terms of the gameplay, one of the cheats say it all.

Kid must rescue the woman he loves by crossing 6 worlds, each split into 4 levels.

Once killed most release things like tokens, keys (sometimes required to open end-of-level doors), apples (for extra energy) and occasionally poison. There are lots of semi-hidden sections and bonus areas to find and explore, including bonus arcade games and fruit machines. Every world ends with a boss.</resource>

It enjoyed more success than its predecessor, Kikstart. The game allowed 2-player simultaneous (via a split-screen facility) or 1-player, vs-computer play. The game mechanics were copied into other games too, like the Game Boy game &amp;quot;Motocross Maniacs&amp;quot;.

The basic premise of the game is to control a bike using acceleration, braking, &amp;quot;hopping&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;wheelies&amp;quot; to navigate across a course of various obstacles, from ramps and gates to telephone boxes and tyres.

The game was based on the BBC Television series Kick Start. An enhanced version was released for the Commodore 128,[1] one of the few native mode game titles for that computer.

Some obstacles only allowed travel across them in certain ways. For instance, fences and wooden beams can only be navigated at low speed, without &amp;quot;hopping&amp;quot; or falling onto them. Tyres would only allow travel at high speeds, driving slowly will &amp;quot;throw&amp;quot; the rider. When a rider lands badly (i.e. with the front wheel first) or &amp;quot;falls off&amp;quot; an obstacle, they are catapulted a certain distance forward, imposing a certain time penalty because the player is not put back into the game until the screen has scrolled to a &amp;quot;safe&amp;quot; (i.e. flat) area of the course on which to restart the bike.

Players can either play against their opponent in a straight-out race to the finish post, or they can &amp;quot;win&amp;quot; by aggregated finishing times. Courses are played in sets of five, denoted by a letter of the alphabet and can be edited by the player using the built-in course designer. This allowed the user to place any obstacles on a blank track and later save and share completed courses.</resource>

The three leagues (Elite, Major and Minor) will differ by the level of brutality. The action takes place in a circular rink. Each team of five players should put the iron ball in the small hole of the opposite team to make a score, and do not allow the players of another team to make the same. Each team player has health indicator, which will decrease during the game, because the only way to take the ball is to knock down the opponent in any brutal way. Each match during the season has time limit, but it may be finished also if all the players of any team will be unconscious and at least one ball will be put in the hole.

The game has a training mode, where you may play a single match with a computer or another human player, and tournament mode, where eight teams controlled either by computer or human players will fight for the victory. Tournament progress may be saved and restored.

With Al Capone out of the picture, Chicago's prohibition-era profit is up for grabs. Are you merciless and cunning enough to gain it by whatever means are required? Every action you take has complex long-term consequences which are not always obvious at the time.

You must keep your people on your side, watching what you say and do, knowing that an overthrow could be hatched at any moment.

On the bottom right of the bowling alley screen there is a power gauge that can be altered pressing the Up and Down keyboard arrow keys / joypad buttons. Pressing the Left and Right keys changes the position of your avatar, and hitting Enter / fire makes a small moving arrow appear in the bowling lane. It shows the direction your character will throw the ball when you hit Enter / fire again.</resource>

A turn based game with a time limit that decreases depending on the skill level you play at.

Depending on your allegiance, you will initially start with a different set of creatures, though the king will not mind whether you're his knight or barbarian. Game consists of four maps, each with more mean creatures to control and meaner opponents to fight, but acquiring those maps early will let you find and buy some mean creatures that will help you easily conquer prior maps.

You can see all the enemies on the map and can literally clear the map of enemies, though random can appear in your castles if you leave them unprotected after the conquest. With each conquered castle (assuming the castle is occupied by the enemy you are currently after), you will get a level up, after first two level-ups king will promote you and you'll be able to recruit cavalries from the castle, after four more promotions you'll be able to recruit knights. All the other creatures are found outside the king's castle and can be recruited no matter the level, although your level determines the quantity of creatures you can find for recruitment, but take care of your money because if you don't have enough for your army's salary, they will desert or turn against you.

There are also two artifacts per each map that will also uncover the map of the place holding the King's Sceptre. The moment you find the sceptre and bring it back to the king, the game will end even if you happen to find it very early in the game.

As for tougher enemies, like the final one having hundreds of dragons and demons, they can also be defeated, but not by the army you can muster in one go. But when you're defeated, you respawn back at the king's castle and start with almost nothing but your money, however, the enemy in the castle will be left without those creatures lost in the battle, unless some of the new comes to aid him as every week the population increases.

Now having needing a queen for companionship, Graham searches the land for a maiden, but to no avail, so he turns to the magic mirror for help. The mirror shows him a beautiful girl locked away in a quartz tower in a faraway land of Kolyma, and must find three keys that are used to unlock the door that will lead to her. 



King's Quest II: Romancing the Throne is a graphic adventure game. As is typical for Sierra's AGI games, players move Graham around with arrow keys and perform actions by typing commands in the interface, which are usually combination of verbs and nouns. The game is similar to its predecessor in structure and gameplay system. Like Daventry, Kolyma is a large cyclical world consisting of interconnected screens. Compared to the first game, it is bigger and busier, with more locations and places of interest. Puzzles follow a similar format; knowledge of fairy tales is advisable for solving some of them, and complex solutions grant the player more points than a brute force approach possible in some cases.</resource>

It wasn't long until Alexander was snatched from his crib and things started to take a turn for the worse. A three-headed dragon threatens the ever-peaceful Daventry, and requires a maiden to be sacrificed every year. Rosella is the chosen one.



Meanwhile, in a secluded house atop a mountain in the land of Llewdor, the evil wizard called Manannan keeps a young lad named Gwydion as his slave, forcing him to do menial tasks as he prepares his spells and observes the country through his telescope. Gwydion must find a way to outsmart the wizard, escape, and eventually discover the truth about his own identity.



King's Quest III: To Heir is Human is an adventure game similar in basic gameplay mechanics to its predecessor The player navigates Gwydion with arrow keys and interacts with the environment by typing verb and noun combination commands. Llewdor consists of interconnected screens that loop once the player character reaches the border of the land. Throughout the course of the game, Gwydion will also travel to other locations and have a magic map at his disposal, allowing him to teleport to different areas. 



There are more items to collect in this installment, and more complex actions required to execute, raising the difficulty level. A large part of the game proceeds in real time, with Mannanan following his own schedule, forcing the player to plan and time his actions. There is also a time limit imposed on the game's first major quest.</resource>

When he returns, he discovers with horror that his home, Daventry Castle, has completely disappeared! Graham is at a loss, and wonders how this could have happened, when a talking owl named Cedric appears. He tells him that he saw the whole thing, and that an evil wizard named Mordack whisked the entire castle away, along with Graham's family in it. Cedric offers to take him to his homeland, Serenia, where his master, the wizard Crispin resides. Surely Crispin will be able to help King Graham rescue his family from Mordack's clutches.



King's Quest V: Absence Makes the Heart Go Yonder is an adventure game, and the first from Sierra to use a point-and-click mouse interface. Rather than typing commands on a keyboard to interact with the game world and use the arrow keys to walk around, King's Quest V instead simplifies all actions down to base commands. To access the different cursors, the player can move the mouse to the top of the screen, revealing a hidden menu with each of the different actions, as well as game options and the inventory bag. By clicking the &amp;quot;Walk&amp;quot; cursor on the screen, Graham will walk as close as he can to the appropriate area. Clicking the &amp;quot;Eye&amp;quot; cursor on items will provide a description, the same as typing &amp;quot;Look at&amp;quot;. The &amp;quot;Hand&amp;quot; cursor is a multipurpose cursor that can be used to push, pull, interact with and pick up objects. The &amp;quot;Head&amp;quot; cursor is used to talk to people (and in the strange world of King's Quest, often objects and animals, too). Players can also right-click to cycle through the different available cursors. Inventory that Graham picks up now gets placed into a bag. By clicking on the bag, this opens up a sub-window that displays all the inventory that Graham currently has. In here, players can look at or interact with objects, combine them with other objects, or pick them up to use them in the game environment as another cursor.</resource>

Eventually he can take it no longer, and he hires a ship to search for the Land of the Green Isles located on the edge of the world. After months of searching he finally sets sight upon the island kingdom, only for a freak storm to strike the ship, destroying it and leaving him the only survivor. His troubles are far from over, however, as he soon finds out that the King and Queen have passed away, the Greens Isles are on the brink of war, and his beloved Princess Cassima may even be held prisoner by the royal vizier.



Like its predecessors in the series, King's Quest VI: Heir Today, Gone Tomorrow is a third-person puzzle-solving adventure game. For Alexander to save the Isles, he must travel between the Land's four magical islands, each based on myth and fables, and encounter people and strange beasts that will either help or hinder him. Alexander must be careful as well, because, as with all the King's Quest games, poor choices or missteps will often prove fatal for the Prince. Puzzles are solved linearly, although late in the game there are two completely different paths to take to reach the final confrontation. Like the previous game, actions are performed using a point-and-click interface with icons that represent verbs (&amp;quot;walk&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;examine&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;use&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;talk&amp;quot;, etc.)</resource>

Their adventure system has been upgraded before, but this time it has been upgraded beyond recognition. So too have their graphics. Gone are the rather rudimentary and meaningless Ã¢â‚¬ËœrepresentationsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ replaced by Ã¢â‚¬ËœdigitisedÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ pictures. Amiga owners get the best of the deal here, for there is more colour per picture on that machine than the others Ã¢â‚¬â€œ including the Atari ST.

But it is the mode of play that has changed most dramatically. No longer do you have to make a map, and slavishly follow it move by move to return to a place you have visited earlier. No longer do you have to remember where you dropped an object that you may need later. All that is required is that you know which object you need, or which location you want to reach. If that makes playing Knight Orc sound dead simple, then forget it! To offset the ease of operation, the adventure is endowed with more than its fair share of independent characters, with minds of their own, who get in your way, grabbing the very item you are looking for, and attack you with relentless determination.

Having spent many hours playing this game I must admit that I didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t actually finish it: IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m not sure that I want to finish wandering about this strange new world inside my Amiga. Of all the Amiga adventures I have played this is the best - try it and see.</resource>

Finding and hatching a Crystallion egg, which is located within the Tsirit (skull). This involves several distinct stages of gameplay.

The Tsirit involves navigating maze-like monster-infested pathways, armed with plasma bolts and a protective suit. Within this you will encounter Bosu, a marble-based game played on a board. The Proda involves placing matching pairs of crystals in such a way that they will be charged by beams of light. 

All the while, you must play the Haresh section, to keep your family under control. This involves financial trading; getting a fair price for the goods you produce, and buying the right amounts of food, clothes and other essentials. Money must also be donated to the Tsirit.

ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the subsidiary characters too: people like Itchy Ã¢â‚¬ËœnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Scratchy, and Krusty the clown. KrustyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Super Fun House is a good-looking, nicely thought-out platform game which should be able to keep the most jaded of gamers on their toes for a while.

You move Krusty about a few platforms, each of which contains a number of doors. Simply stand outside a door, soak in the strangely menacing music, press the fire-button and in you go to one of the sub-levels. Then all you have to do is to play a kind of reverse Troddlers/Lemmings in which you have to lead a bunch of rats to their deaths at the hands of a major Simpsons character. Like Troddlers you have to make use of blocks to achieve this aim. Unlike Troddlers you have to search for these blocks along your way - and this search becomes more difficult with the later levels.

The game looks excellent, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s some great use of colour and neatly designed levels, but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s let down by strange parallax scrolling and poor collision detection. Despite the moans KrustyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Super Fun House is a mightily enjoyable piece of Amiga gameplay. Once youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve got over the initial amazement that Krusty himself can outleap Bob Fosbury from a standing start, you will find yourself coming back for more and more.</resource>

Like in all such games, your goal on each level is to break all the bricks with a ball, which you bounce with a paddle, and try to save it from falling out of the level. 

Some bricks have a random power-up within them. There are many various power-ups (most beneficial, some of them harmful), such as: lengthening/shortening our paddle, enlarging or duplicating our ball, adding thrusters to the paddle so that it can fly, adding various weapons so that the paddle can shoot and destroy bricks, and many more. 

Occasionally, various monsters will appear on the playfield and begin flying around. Most of those are harmless and do nothing except interfering with the ball (if it hits them, it bounces off). However, some monsters will destroy your paddle if they touch it. 

Each few levels, there comes a special action sequence where you try to defend yourself from a horde of incoming monsters, or defeat a boss by shooting it and avoiding its missiles.

Like Fast Food it doesn't directly resemble the main series of arcade adventures, instead being a single-screen action game, resembling Pengo. The basic idea is to move around a maze of blocks collecting fruit, but the twist in the style is that you push the blocks in the maze to kill or trap those enemies. After every level is completed a short bonus screen appears where more fruit can be collected. During play various other tokens are released, such as bonus points, a smart bomb and control reversal.

The road scrolls vertically, with some moderately sharp bends in a manner similar to Spy Hunter You have a jump device to clear the many jumps,  or to land onto and flatten the other maniacs who line the road. You must choose which path to follow at OutRun-style forks in the road. 

The roads contain bonus tags including bonus points, a battering ram to make contact with other cars more effective, and energy boosts to replenish damage. If you leave the road you must replace your car onto it using a directable winch which appears at the appropriate point.

Your mission is to rescue everyone, identify mistakes and destroy the wrong pages, save the copyists and find the 4 keys that will lead to treasure and grammar book.
Ingame, you must move your hero through the maze and enter the rooms that come to you to answer questions about French grammar or fight the minions of sorcerer Errare.

During a training session, he is mysteriously transported to 20th-century New York. The evil Shogun is back! Torn from his time, the Last Ninja must defend himself once again, believing only in his own abilities.
The player controls a powerful ninja and must fight his way through his opponents while collecting items. The game is divided into several levels, each representing a different location and divided into several screens. The view is isometric, and the ninja can move in four different dimensions and jump.
The ninja must fight his enemies with his bare hands or with the weapons he finds along the way. There is a special ranged weapon: the shuriken, which inflicts heavy damage.</resource>

The games do not feature any sequences of nail biting action, and yet on the Commodore 64, Leader Board was the top selling game in 1986. As the Amiga market is following closely in the footsteps of the 64, it is not surprising that three of the first sports conversions are golf games, although they do vary wildly in quality.

Leader Board can only really be described as an arcade golf game. It takes the basic ideas behind golf, simplifies them, and turns the game into one that depends as much on dexterity as it does on tactics.

Once loaded, Leader Board gives you the choice of how many players will take part Ã¢â‚¬â€œ between one and four Ã¢â‚¬â€œ what course you want to play on Ã¢â‚¬â€œ from the four provided Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and what level you want to play at. Provided with the minimalist British packaging, it is a comprehensive guide to both the game and the four courses, and on the Amateur level (where the ball is not affected by book, swing or wing), it is possible for even a total beginner to get round the courses without too many mistakes.

For anyone who has never played golf before, Leader Board provides an excellent introduction. It is one of the most playable sports simulations yet, and even my golf-mad dad found the game simple enough to spend a few quiet hours fiddling with the mouse. In comparison with most games on the Amiga, the graphics are not spectacular, but they are good enough to reflect all the action, and that is the most important. The sound too is uninspiring, but surprisingly the lack of audio-visual stimulation is not seen to detract too much from the game's overall enjoyment level.</resource>

Before we discuss why, let's look at what makes Leading Lap a creditable pretender to the crown. It's got a tremendous multiview 3D polygon based engine driving it and the frame rate is fast enough to ensure a smooth, believable motor racing environment. It makes use of extra memory, faster processors and FPUs with the handling of the various cars is such that if you drive too fast on a long bend the car spins out due to excessive speed Ã¢â‚¬â€œ incredibly realistic for a game which is more arcade based than simulation. Finally, the driving has a reasonably good feel to it (or a hybrid between an arcade game and a simulation)

And then there's the but. An unfortunate but, but a 'but' nevertheless. There aren't enough competitors taking part in the race - four in all. To maintain a credible sense of conflict throughout a full race, there should always be someone to press for a place, or someone pressing for a place on you. That doesn't happen with Leading Lap. Still, it's fun in a limited kind of a way to reach the giddy heights of being the winner all the time. With twelve tracks to race on it's going to take you a reasonable stretch of extended play before approaching anything like full competency.

In all, a competent, enjoyable romp. Not quite up with F1 for immediacy and out and out pace, but still good enough to convince enough people to part with their cash for a few hours of solid entertainment. If you've got an Amiga friend, try out the serial link option; it's not bad.</resource>

As the game starts, four soldiers are depicted, with any who are not present to play killed immediately - a joystick adaptor is required for 3 or 4 player games.

Leatherneck resembles Ikari Warriors - waves of soldiers move down the screen shooting at you, and you must shoot them before the bullets make contact. You are armed with grenades to take out mounted turrets, or kill a wide range of enemies at once, but watch out for enemy grenades. There are extra ammunition crates and improved weapons to pick up - waggle the joystick to toggle which one you are using.

Unusually, your shots are long-range and take effect instantly. You cannot change the direction you are facing, instead having the ability to strafe.

The whole crew has managed to flee - except Nigel MacGibbons who slept through the evacuation due to his nightly drinking activities. Now he needs to reach the last escape pod by finding his way through ten levels, all with a big boss at the end. From an overhead perspective, the player controls MacGibbons through the corridors and rooms of the ship, scrolling in multiple directions. Despite controlling a human instead of a ship, the game is a straight shooter: using a gun to kill everything that moves while dodging enemy attacks and bullets. Getting hit reduces the energy bar and when it reaches zero, a life is lost. Special symbols give advantages when picked up, like extra time on the time limit, extra lives or weapon upgrades.</resource>

The underlying storyline is simple enough: something is causing mischief amongst the mightier members of your land. Kal the Pauper has had to steal all the crops from your nation in order to live. Azeulisse, the mistress of the 100 countries, has had her daughter abducted: and until she is returned, no more children will be born. Finally, Theros, a rather rich magician, has caught a vile skin disease. Until he's rid of it, the plague will spread throughout the length and breadth of the land.

You are not without help, however. Petroy the gnome, faithful companion to Hokram, reckons that he can make a potion for Theros' disease: if he gets the right ingredients. And a useful heirloom inherited from daddy is the mysterious Great Alambic.

The pictures used in legend of Djel are quite good, although the quality ranges from good to suspect. Colour strobing is used to indicate that something interesting is going on, which makes you suspect that whoever programmed it wasn't clued up on animation techniques to any extent. The sub-games, while competent, don't stretch the Amiga in the least. After some sampled music at the start, the effects are rather puny by today's standards.

If you want a mouse click adventure game, then Legend of Djel is just what the doctor ordered. In terms of appeal or depth, it really doesn't have anything to recommend it, but the puzzling may keep you occupied for a few days.</resource>

    <resource id="1e3a39fce92d23b9ffb9011b0f606dea031fc2a2" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">A version of an old Norse board game called King's Table. The game has black and white teams, like chess, but each team has different pieces and a different raison d'etre. 

The white team has a total of 13 pieces, the most important one being Odin the King, who starts in the centre of the 10x10 board and moves in the same way as a chess King, whereas black has 20 pawns and four other pieces. White wins if Odin can reach one of the corner squares; black wins if it surrounds Odin on all 4 sides. The pawns actually move the same way as chess queens, but pieces are captured by surrounding them on 2 sides (although some special pieces must be surrounded on 3 sides). The specials are chosen from the selection at the start of the game, and have a variety of abilities, some 'borrowed' from chess.</resource>

    <resource id="7d7339fc187da1d41d8bab4985ed31a741ae10fb" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">The premise of the Zelda style game is that a hero with a mission (rescue princess, free lands, destroy evil - that sort of thing) sets off on a voyage of discovery through different 'lands' or 'zones'. Picking up weapons along the way it ends up being a cross between a Commando style game and an adventure. Yes, you have to shoot or beat things roundly about the head with swords and like, but you also have to collect an inventory, talk to people and solve puzzles. Legends fits all of the above criteria. Give someone an object for a favour? Yes. this game is all about trading too.

Life is a precious thing in Legends. You have a certain number of continues, but there is no facility to save a game in the middle of a level, which is frustrating. One of Legends' great advantages is that you have four worlds to explore: North American, Egypt, Mediaeval, China and an additional Space Ship level. This provides major variety in terms of gameplay but it also means that once you're used to the enemies in one world everything changes in the next one and you start getting killed too easily.

Another annoying point about Legends is that the weapons are a bit weedy and the enemies are too persistent at times. This means that you can spend far too long high-tailing it out of situations without having enough chance to stand and fight, which I always find most enjoyable.

This is a step above Speris, and those who have boon searching for Zelda on an A1200 or A4000 need look no further. With various sub games, mazes and the like there is a lot of gameplay in here, and even though the various attempts at humour seem to fall flat (on me at least) it's still a fun adventure.</resource>

Your cousin Sven is not evil though, so when he disappears, you head to Mitteldorf to try to track him down.

Legends of Valour is a role-playing game using a similar movement system to Ultima Underworld. You walk through the world in real time, passing texture-mapped buildings. The complex gameworld is over a mile squared and includes 40 miles of underground tunnels, as well a thousands of characters getting on with their daily business.

When designing your character, you can customise his or her looks, and this affects your likelihood of being befriended or fought. To make any inroads into finding Sven, you will need to join professional Guilds and complete quests. You have spells available to you, but will need to acquire more as the game progresses.</resource>

The player starts the game with a group of five characters. The way of progress is not specified, with no specific path to follow. The authors give two possibilities - adventure wandering or strategic conquest. The first option allows travelling through the land, exploring areas, trading, talking with encountered characters, recruiting new team members, visiting settlements and towns. The second one requires conquering the villages and cities, spying, expansion of fortifications and weapon facilities, setting tax, forming legions and competition with all three remaining AI commanders. 

The game features nine races. The gameplay is divided into a strategic map and a terrain action. Each character is described by six indicators (strength, energy, speed, resistance, magic, experience). The player may buy equipment increasing character stats for each team member. Orders may be given to the whole team or a single character. Warriors may use traditional weapons, magical items and numerous spells.</resource>

He used to be in the software business, but decided to leave everything behind as he moved to the city of Lost Wages in pursuit of sexual fulfillment. Clad in a white polyester leisure suit, Larry finds himself outside of Lefty's Bar, determined to finally lose his virginity - or commit suicide if he is unable to achieve that goal before dawn.

Leisure Suit Larry in the Land of the Lounge Lizards is the first game in Al Lowe's Leisure Suit Larry series, largely inspired by the text adventure Softporn Adventure, though with a greatly enhanced script containing more humorous descriptions and dialogue. The gameplay is similar to other third-person Sierra adventures: a text parser is used to input commands for interaction with a graphical environment. Progress is achieved by collecting various items and figuring out which of those may be essential for conquering the hearts of the several female characters appearing in the game.</resource>

The middle-aged would-be-womanizer Larry Laffer fell off a boat during a cruise and sustained amnesia, forgetting how he and his sweetheart Patti got separated, how Larry got a job in LA, how Patti got a job with the FBI, and what happened in (the never released) Larry 4. Now Larry and Patti are working independently on two cases that are connected to each other, even though the heroes aren't aware of that. Larry's new bosses are involved in shady business, while Patti agrees to take a break from her career as a performing pianist and become an undercover agent. Will the two be together ever again?

Unlike the previous games with their text input, Larry 5 utilizes a graphical, icon-based interface. The player uses verb commands (&amp;quot;Look&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Talk&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Use&amp;quot; etc.) to interact with the environment. In a way not quite typical for Sierra's adventure games, it is impossible to &amp;quot;die&amp;quot; in Larry 5, and the amount of &amp;quot;dead ends&amp;quot; (unwinnable situations) is greatly reduced. The game is also less puzzle-oriented, allowing the player to proceed even if he/she fails to solve the required puzzle in some cases. However, the player is awarded more points for finding the &amp;quot;right&amp;quot; solution. As in the third game, both Larry and Patti are available as playable characters during different chapters of the story.</resource>

Use your joystick to lead Leonardo through 50 different levels including banks, museums, and warehouses. Pressing the fire button of your joystick you can push everything in your way, except walls. Pushed objects won't stop until colliding with other objects or the police officer and his ghost deputy whom are trying to stop your robberies. Every level has a time limit in which you must bring three equal items into one line to complete the level. Each level is larger than the screen, in the lower half of the screen you have a helpful radar for orientation. Running out of time or being caught by the police-men will cost you one of your five lives. If you are able to master the first ten levels you will receive a password, which you can use to start your next game directly on this level.</resource>

Three smart bombs which destroy everything on the screen help in tight situations. Every level runs on a time limit.</resource>

To diagnose a patient, you have to press on his or her abdomen, to see which portions of the stomach cause pain. Basing on this knowledge, you can choose a therapy for him (observation, medication or referring to another specialist) or administer a X-Ray or ultrasound scan to get more information about his illness. 

In some cases, surgery will be necessary. You're the surgeon and you have to perform the operation very carefully, adhering strictly to the procedures, preserving hygiene, and maintaining care when cutting up the patient. 

Should you mistakenly administer the wrong therapy, or kill your patient at the operating table, you're kicked into the medical school, where you're given hints as to what you've done wrong.

As you've captured the Rapier machine gun your enemy have been developing, there are plenty who can't bear to see the back of you unless it's bloodied and lifeless.

The game's 8 levels feature quite a variety of settings, vehicles and situations. You will have to evade fire from snipers based in windows, enemy jets, helicopters and well-trained marines, while riding tanks and speedboats as well as being on foot. The levels are set in locations such as the enemy camp, the jungle, a ruined city and the final flight back to your base.

Okay, such a claim is obviously a wild exaggeration, but you can't fail to be impressed by the excellent course backgrounds and options available. The animation is very smooth on the eye, and the swing of the clubs isn't impossible to control either.

I feel that I must warn you now about the one and only serious problem with this game, and for some of you it will make the prospect of a round with Links virtually impossible to bear. Every time you take a shot, your trusty old Amiga will take an average of about 25 seconds to redraw the view for your next pot at the flag. After a while this becomes very frustrating indeed, and as you can probably imagine, it takes about two hours to complete a full round. I suppose it does represent a realistic golf simulation if you take the last two points into account though. After all, the few occasions that have seen me venture onto a real golf course hove ended approximately a couple of hours later in tears of frustration.
I still like Links despite this fault, and just think what the mark below could have been if it wasn't so slow to play.

Just a final point to say that to play Links, you'll need either a hard disk or two floppy drives but A3000 + WHDLoad is recommended combination.</resource>

His father is the current King of the Savannah and the young prince is able to frolic the lands at will; jumping on and around other subjects of this animal kingdom. When Simba's father, King Mufasa, is killed and his evil brother Scar takes over the kingdom, Simba is banished from the lands of his birthright and has to grow up fast, honing his skills, for the day of his return.

The Lion King, based on the famous Disney movie, is a platform game where you control Simba - initially as a young cub, and later as an adult lion. The plot of the game follows the plot of the movie. Each of the levels represents a part of the movie. 

As young Simba, you can fight various beasts, such as lizards, by jumping on them. You can also roar to scare some creatures into submission, though every time you roar, you have to wait for your &amp;quot;roar meter&amp;quot; to charge. 

As an adult lion, you can still roar and jump, but now you fight enemies by slashing at them with your claws (if you're skillful enough, you can also grab them and toss them off the screen). 

The game features no in-game save function, and it needs to be replayed from the beginning every time.</resource>

When you load the game for the first time and personalise it with your name you'll see a house with several rooms like a kitchen, living room, bed room, etc. After some time of waiting a little person will appear and check out the house with all its rooms to see if he likes it. If he likes it, he will move in shortly and bring his dog along with him. That's where the real &amp;quot;game&amp;quot; starts and thats what it will be like every time you'll load the game from then. You see the house and the little person living in it, doing all kinds of stuff people do in their daily routine. He'll cook, eat, feed his dog, read newspapers, watch TV and from time to time he will write you a letter to let you know what he feels or what things he misses. To keep it more gamelike, you can &amp;quot;talk&amp;quot; to him in form of typing commands like &amp;quot;feed dog&amp;quot;. You can also play cards with him and send him food or a present.
There is no aim in this game other than to interact with your LCP.

    <resource id="96fe5d7edd9d99a9d13c6a9ffe9f528fe0280456" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Livingstone II is an excellent sequel to Livingstone I Presume, Opera Soft's classic side-scrolling 2D platformer. Adventure game fans will be glad to know that Opera Soft drops the action focus of the first game this time around, and return to the action/adventure mix.

The plot is negligible, but it does pick up where the first game left off. You play Dr. David Livingstone, legendary adventurer who was found by journalist Stanley at the end of the first game. Your job is to get out of Africa jungles alive, but before that, you must discover ancient treasure hidden in the ruins. Similar to the first game, Livingstone II allows you to change weapons in your arsenal at any time. The trusty whip and pole, which is used to vault across chasms, are back and more useful than ever. In addition to weapon slots, you also have inventory slots to store and use non-weapon objects you come across. While much of the game still requires reflexes to succeed, there is a considerable number of adventure-style puzzles to solve. In addition to hostile animals, you must deal with traps and other obstacles.

I feel that Livingstone II is easier than the first game, perhaps because most danger comes in the form of traps, which you just need good timing to avoid, rather than angry creatures that you must dispose of to save yourself. As in the first game, the maps in Livingstone II are large and intricate, full of hidden surprises and shortcuts. Overall, Livingstone II is a fun action/adventure platformer that action fans will enjoy -- and adventure game fans may be interested in as well.</resource>

'90s ultraviolence in its very essence! Hours of fun for you (and a camel-friend if you like) blowing away horde after horde of alien fiends in the comfort of your own personal environment!

This game is based on an old Williams arcade game by the same dude who wrote Defender. The game - Robotron - was a big hit in the early Eighties. Llamatron takes the Robotron idea and distorts it in a Yakly fashion, adding loads of new stuff and plenty of furry beasties in the Llamasoft style.

You play the part of a totally hard laser-spitting llama. Your mission is to collect all the tiny sheep, llamas, camels and goats you see on each wave.  Standing in your way are great herds of unintelligent but numerous Grunt enemies, plus a veritable menagerie of nasty creeps which fire at you, dodge your fire, emit fire hydrants, try to ram you, murder your llamas and shoot your bottom off with lasers. Kill them deadly.

Not everything can be killed, and some enemies take more than one shot to destroy. Your ultimate objective - destroy the Ozric Tentacle of level 99 and get to Herd Heaven on level 100.</resource>

The setting is pure fantasy Ã¢â‚¬â€ the Old World is wrecked by magical discharges, and the wizards who attempted to keep it balanced ultimately gave up, and used their skill to create a new world. These Lords of Chaos (up to four, played either by human or computer) may now battle for control of this world.

The idea of the game is to escape the level within a certain number of moves (preferably carrying lot of treasure and having killed the evil wizard Torquemada). Along the way you can use wizardry weapons and spells (there are 45 in total, created by combining ingredients) to conjure up mystical creatures like dragons and unicorns, but unfortunately so can Torquemada. Worlds include marshlands, castles and forests.</resource>

    <resource id="ce025b86e3b9b1019620d1438adaecc6a984d055" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">A potentially good horror RPG that unfortunately fumbled, Lords of Doom from Attic/StarByte looks, feels, and plays like a second-rate Ã¢â‚¬Å“BÃ¢â‚¬Â horror movie than Alfred Hitchcock classic. You control a party of four characters, two hapless citizens and two vampire hunters, who are the last human survivors in the town of Vertic that has been overrun by evil minions of the hordes of darkness. Your job, naturally, is to fight hideous monsters, find the lairs of four unholy lords, and vanquish them from the land.

Gameplay is standard first-person perspective, with party members displayed in four portraits at the bottom of the screen. In addition to health bar, each character has a food and thirst level bars which you must take care to fill by having the character eat or drink. This might add a fun touch of realism to the game, but unfortunately the extreme lack of food and water makes gameplay very frustrating. Worst yet, each character only has 6 inventory slots, so saving a ton of food for later consumption is out of the question.

The game does offer some find-key-to-unlock-door puzzles, but the endless hordes of monsters (most of which look the same) makes playing an exercise in frustration. Overall, Lords of Doom is a huge disappointment... a game that promises a lot but ends up being only a bland RPG. Only the most die-hard horror RPG fans might be interested in this one.</resource>

On every screen, there is a castle defended by a movable shield. The shield can be moved horizontally and vertically (always along the castle wall). The goal is to bring down the walls of one of the other castles within a given time limit. If no one does this in time, the game automatically switches to &amp;quot;fast speed&amp;quot; until the first slot is shattered.

The well animated graphic looks decent, changes from level to level and the scrolling is nice. The sound effects are according to the atmosphere, beautifully creepy - timely. You can not complain about the joystick control either. What else is there? Menu with numerous options (faster, slower, etc.), pause function, highscore list. The gameplay is not exactly the latest, but the original presentation and the built-in gags, The Lords of War lift something of the usual breakout monotony from. After all...</resource>

Location layout and characters are randomly generated each time the player begins the game.</resource>

    <resource id="cc9ae28155e15015c4a32b0970167f722a9cd2ef" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Three Vikings, Eric the Swift, Olaf the Stout and Baleog the Fierce, were kidnapped by the alien Tomator, the evil Croutonian ruler, who is collecting unique life forms to display in his gallery. The three Vikings will have to combine their unique skills to defeat Tomator, as well as a vast array of aliens, robots, giant snails, big lizards and more.

The Lost Vikings is a side-scrolling platform puzzle game with a twist. Instead of one character who can jump, run, shoot, collect items, flip switches and so on, there are three different characters, each with his own skills. Eric the Swift can jump, run and bash through walls with his tough helmet. Olaf the Stout has a shield which can block attacks, function as an air glider or as a step to stand on. Baleog the Fierce can shoot things with his arrows (including switches) or kill things with his sword. The player has to use the three Vikings as a team if he wants to get past the increasingly difficult levels and puzzles.

The player controls one Viking at a time, but can switch between them at any point. The Vikings have limited space in their inventory which they can use to keep various items. Each Viking has three health points, and if he loses them all from confrontations with dangers, he dies (some threats kill instantly), and the level must be restarted.

Despite bearing the name of one of Germany's best players, the game's scope is not as large as the likes of Champion Manager; instead, the game focuses on tactics and action-oriented gameplay where you can control each player directly. The game strikes a good balance between action and tactics, although neither element is as good as the best of each camp. Choose to lead your favorite club from five European countries (England, France, Italy, Spain, and Germany) in a friendly match, league, or cup play. Overall, Lothar MatthÃƒÂ¤us is a decent beer-and-pretzel soccer simulation/action game that doesn't take itself too seriously. Good as a quick fix, but lacking in long-term play value to warrant repeated play.</resource>

The game features a total of 32 fictitious racetracks from around the world, split into 3 difficulty levels. There are 19 computer opponents (15 on the 8-bit versions) and you have to finish in the top 10 (top 8 on the 8-bits) to progress. The higher you finish in one race, the lower down the grid you start for the next race. The opposition drivers have pun names based on the F1 drivers of the day - examples include Ricardo Pastry and Crashhard Banger.

You can choose between sound effects or one of a variety of music pieces. The game features a simultaneous 2-player mode, but the 1-player mode only uses half the screen, a simple animation filling the other half. In most races you will have to make a pitstop for fuel in order to reach the finish. The tracks include features such as oil slicks, roadworks, boulders and rivers - contact with these (or the other cars) will slow you, but there is no car damage model.

There are 13 different types of races, ranging from Motorways to night-time to sections punctuated by roadworks, and some are lap-based with others being simple A-B. 2 players could play on a split screen mode.

The game's crowning glory, however, was the RECS editor, which allowed you to create courses of your own, with theoretically millions possible.</resource>

(Mean Ugly Dirty Sports) is a slightly humorous but definitely violent game in which the game itself is won by scoring at least 7 out of 14 goals or by killing enough of the opposing team. Tackles, pummelings, being thrown into the moat -where a shark-like thing will eat you if you don't get out on time- are just some of the things that can happen to your team.

Ofcourse, there are more ways to win: bribing the opposing team, the referee, or the creature which is used as the ball are worth considering.

Should your team need a little extra morale, just pick a fight, or buy and sell players on the slave market whenever you like.

M.U.D.S. vaguely resembles Speedball in the sense that you try to throw the ball in the opponent's goal, but that's where the resemblance ends for me.</resource>

Wrong. Since the dawn of time it seems that only one out of every fifteen new budget titles were good, and it looks like staying that way on the Amiga.

Set in Egypt you play the part of the cat goddess Mafdet who is trying to recover the Book of the Dead which has been stolen by the evil god Seth and unless it is recovered no Egyptian will be able to enter the afterlife.

Being a god Mafdet can transform into a cat as well as her normal human form. In cat mode Mafdet can run, jump and pick up objects - not too much use against the minions of Seth, but at least they don't notice you. As a woman you can swing a fairly brutal sword.

The general playing area is large, and I found myself noticing a new exit from the screens just as I thought I was stuck. Some exits are too low to allow the woman to pass through until you run into them with the cat. Other times a hole in the floor is the best way through.

The graphics are really large, though the animation and definition fail to make any lasting impact. As well as not being exactly too pretty to look at the main character is also impossible to control accurately. Mafdet is depressing to play, it's not that cheap and it most definitely isn't cheerful.</resource>

The only prototype is held in a network of caves within an asteroid, heavily protected by 30 different types of craft. As a pilot of the T2 'Magic Fly' craft, it is your job to find and destroy the Moth.

You fly through a set of tunnels presented in a mixture of vectors and solid 3D, with arrows guiding you as to which way to go. The ship's damage is split into ten areas, and the auto-repair feature can be set to prioritise these. Energy resources are limited, and must be allocated across different areas of the ship.

Accurate steering and shooting are not enough Ã¢â‚¬â€œ puzzles protect the route, and these will take some pondering. You are armed with multiple weapons (types of lasers, mines, a rear-gunning-droid and various guiding missiles), each of which has its own use. You also have an on-board map and radar, as well as a turbo facility.</resource>

    <resource id="f81fc20bb1f4b7b0edc8397b15ce8633c8f36eb5" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Magic Johnson's Basketball is a decent arcade-style basketball game starring LA Lakers' superstar Magic Johnson, one of the most famous players of all time. It is a direct translation of the popular coin-op arcade game called Magic Johnson's Fastbreak Basketball. Like the arcade original, the game is easy enough for beginners to learn, and challenging enough for experts. You can play against the computer or another human opponent in a hot-seat mode.

As an arcade-oriented game, Magic Johnson's Basketball is pretty good. You can shoot 3-pointers, perform slam dunks, and of course Magic Johnson's famous fast break with a slam dunk finish. The game includes a good training sequence, demo mode, and smooth animation.

When compared with other basketball games made during the same period, Magic Johnson's Basketball falls flat with many limitations. You can only play a single game, unlike the entire season that Ed Ringler's Omni-Play Basketball (also a Magic Johnson-promoted game) simulates. And the on-court action is far from the fun of EA's 1988 classic One on One: Jordan vs. Bird. Without the competition, Magic Johnson's Basketball would have been considered a great game. But basketball fans simply have many better choices to choose from than this game.</resource>

It is the sixth game in the Dizzy series, and the fourth adventure-based Dizzy title. The story, set in a fantasy world called Magicland, follows on from the events of Fantasy World Dizzy, the previous adventure title. In Magicland Dizzy the player controls Dizzy, an egg-shaped character, who is trying to save six of his friends who have been placed under spells by the Evil Wizard Zaks.

In Magicland Dizzy the player guides Dizzy, an egg-shaped character, through a large maze in an attempt to rescue his six friends who are held captive under the influence of various magic spells. The locations are all located in the titular &amp;quot;Magicland&amp;quot; and are fantastical in nature, many inspired by fairy tales. They include a field of standing stones called Weirdhenge, a witch's island and Prince Charming's castle. Movement from one screen to the next is enabled through flip-screen such that when Dizzy touches the outer edge of one screen he is transported to the next. The individual screens consist of platforms and ladders with Dizzy able to both walk and jump to navigate the maze and its obstacles. Dizzy can collect up to three items at once which are then used at specific locations to solve puzzles and advance through the game. At the start of the game the player has three lives and a health bar which can be replenished by finding and collecting diamonds scattered throughout the maze.</resource>

You are in control of a car, driving up a vertically scrolling road with occasional forks in it, making the game similar to Spy Hunter. The car is mounted with guns, and so are many enemy cars, but cars can be rammed off the road as well as shot. Watch out for other enemy vehicles such as helicopters though; be sure to avoid their bullets. You can drive into the back of open lorries to gain upgraded weapons. Weapons are activated via keyboard presses, which makes the game more difficult than it would otherwise be. Sound and music sampled from suitably action-packed films aims to add to the atmosphere.</resource>

As well as making managerial decisions you can even play for the entire team!

But before you get your boots on, there's a bit of managing to do via the icon-driven menu system. Of course, no amount of training will be enough for some old snoggers so they can be sold and new players bought via the transfer system.

Matches are viewed from side-on view. Both United and the opposition can be player or computer-controlled. Players dribble automatically and shoot when the fire button is released - the strength of kick determined by the time fire was held down. In addition you can chip the ball by pressing fire again quickly afterwards. Tackling is achieved either by running into the ball or by doing a sliding tackle. If mistimed the latter can lead to a free kick.

In terms of presentation you have easy-to-use menus with a fair amount of disk accessing. Graphics are okay apart from pastel colour scheme and 'skating' players. Sound represents appallingly annoying tune with a reasonable match FX. Gameplay is not that great since it is frustratingly difficult to score goals. Man Utd fans will enjoy the almost forgotten experience of winning the league. Like the team, strictly second division.</resource>

Which is, of course, the year when Manchester United won both the English league and FA cup in the same season. Hence Ã¢â‚¬Å“The DoubleÃ¢â‚¬Â in the name of the game. But don't let this fool you, you can choose to play any team from the top 5 leagues of the English game. Also you can customize any team or player in the league to fit your liking. Not that it gets any better than Keane, Giggs and Cantona though...

The statistical side if the game is impressive, as is the tactical. Both are quite simple and straight-forward, but still lets an advanced manager fiddle around a lot. You choose formation, players, arrange transfers and of course play games.

The matches are similar to what it looks and feels like in Kick Off 3 or even Sensible soccer. Graphics are OK but not more, the sound actually has some crowd noises and chants. If you listen closely you'll hear: Ã¢â‚¬Å“United, UnitedÃ¢â‚¬Â. Not surprising perhaps but it does make the matches more lively.

Controls during the games are good, but it's quite hard to score in your first games. Keep going though and you'll find that it can be done, but you'll hardly get many Ã¢â‚¬Å“crazyÃ¢â‚¬Â results against top-level opposition. The heading of the ball is a bit strange as the players look to jump about 5 meters up in the air, and have a hang-time that would make Michael Jordan jealous.

This was the third in Krisalis series of United games, it's also the best in my opinion. Not a true classic but you can challenge a friend or have some tough games anyway. Fighting your way through the friendlies, cups and leagues with your favourite team is really fun. A recommended download for anyone that enjoys football games.</resource>

Well, maybe not so much click. The game doesn't have outstanding graphics, even for that period. It doesn't have a richly developed storyline, either. What it does have is just enough plot and just enough mystery and adventure to keep most people interested.

Manhunter is puzzle driven with some arcade style action sequences thrown in. While the NPC character development is very weak, it is your detective skills in tracking the non-playing characters and determining their motives that makes the game interesting.

The game begins in the future. The year 2002 to be exact (ahem). Aliens have invaded New York and taken over the city. Being that the aliens have no arms and legs they must recruit humans to do the work of policing the population and eliminating any threats to the alien rule. Your part in the game begins two years after the invasion. You are one of the privileged manhunters and are rousted form your slumber by one of the aliens who is directing you to investigate a case involving an explosion and murder at Bellevue Hospital. Your adventure will take place over the course of four days. 

Bottom line. Even though Manhunter: New York is not strong on either the plot or graphics fronts it is, nonetheless, fun to play. The game will certainly test your puzzle solving and detective skills. Long live the resistance.</resource>

The Manhunters are human employees of the Orbs who have the job of tracking down, capturing and handing over people conducting anti-Orb activities.

The game action is broken up in four ways. First, there are close up views of your immediate area which allow you to interact with the objects and characters around you. Next is the transport screen, which is basically a map of 'Cisco showing all the locations you can visit. Third are the arcade sequences which include shoot 'em ups, and a maze-like game similar to that found in the hospital section of It Came From The Desert. Finally there are animated sequences which help break up the action and add to the atmosphere of the game.

There are no text commands; everything is entered via the mouse and the return key, so you don't have to worry about ambiguous transatlantic gibberish.

The graphics are technically poor and clumsy, but some of the animated sequences are superb. The accompanying soundtrack, however, is totally inadequate and spoils the effect. Overall, Manhunter: San Francisco is an exciting sequel. Don't expect a Leisure Suit Larry clone, it's nothing like it, rather Manhunter has a style all its own.</resource>

There have been rumors of strange experiments going on and of odd creatures living amongst the Edison family. There is even a story that a meteorite once crashed near the home nearly 20 years ago. More immediately, a girl named Sandy has gone missing from the local highschool and her boyfriend Dave swears that he saw Dr. Fred abducting her. Dave knows that he cannot do it alone and will need help from two other students if he has any hope of infiltrating the mansion and rescuing Sandy.
nnPlayers start by choosing 2 students to accompany Dave to the Edison mansion, and can then switch between these three characters at will. Most actions are carried out by selecting verbs on the screen and applying them to an object (such as &amp;quot;OPEN Door&amp;quot;). Each character maintains a separate personality and may have a different way to solve a problem from his classmates.</resource>

There are four types of arenas: &amp;quot;Robo Zones&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Dungeon Zones&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Rainbow Zones&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;Starship Zones&amp;quot;. Besides the gold coins, each arena is filled with monsters, hazards, and weapons which you must look out for. Use the map to help you locate these.

As you progress through the arenas, there are new challenges which you must face such as multi-level arenas, locked doors and passages, slippery surfaces, and much more. Also scattered throughout the arenas is the letter &amp;quot;B&amp;quot;, which when collected will award you a letter that make up the word CREDIT. When you have formed the word, you will be awarded an extra credit. Besides the standard arenas, there are also speed arenas, which are more difficult than the others. The object of these arenas is to get past more obstacles and gather as many coins as you can before the time expires.

In each arena, you will receive messages from time to time, as well as a password, which you can enter to resume that game from that arena.

It turns out that he was one of eight scientists involved in Project Overlord, a mission to remotely control people. Tex soon learns of the deaths of other related figures. Suspects may include the British intelligence head, a surveillance company owner, and the professor's daughter.

Tex's first adventure takes the player through the seedy West Coast world of 2033, a setting that combines futuristic elements with film noir and &amp;quot;hardboiled&amp;quot; detective fiction styles. The game's main adventure portions are icon-driven, with object puzzles less significant than detective deduction and character interaction. Characters are represented by digitized photos.

Mean Streets features dozens of characters to interact with by asking questions or offering bribes. Fights often arise, but a diplomatic approach is more successful with characters whose guilt is unproven. Although it is largely an adventure game, travel between cities involves piloting Tex's Lotus Speeder in a flight simulation section. The game also contains side-scrolling action sequences where Tex has to eliminate a number of enemies before being able to proceed to the destination.</resource>

The game is split into 10 levels - the first 9 are groups of 3 territories which can be completed in any order, while the final 'Mother of All Battles' has its own surprises. 

Land is mostly of sand, grass or ice. You start with 100 men and you can use whatever quantity you find necessary on each island. The rest men left will go to another level with another new 100. In the second half of the game you can freeze men to save them for the Mother of All Battles. Once you select your island and place for your HQ, you must do some research for better weapons and defences. On the roof of your buildings you can put protectors like archers, gunmen, boiling oil men, and later on even laser turrets. If you send a team of unarmed men into an unoccupied square, they will build an additional base there, with larger armies completing this more quickly.</resource>

The balls are linked together with one acting as an anchor the others are constantly rotating around. The game is played with the mouse. By clicking on one of the balls it becomes the anchor that the others rotate around. Clicking with the right mouse button changes the direction of the rotation.

Each level has obstacles that block the balls' path and objects that can be collected. Most common are blocks that are destroyed after being hit by a ball a couple of times but there are also those obstacles that destroy the ball that hits them. There are also bombs, which set off chain reactions when hit, and switcher blocks that reveal hidden doors or open up new passages. When all balls but one have been destroyed a life is lost and the level has to be restarted. Each level also has a time limit. Overstepping it is allowed but the player will then get a lower score. 

The game has a total of 100 levels that are divided into four categories: easy, average, difficult and very difficult. For every level completed the player is given a password.</resource>

    <resource id="fc3cc14d6e21bd3b48b2ec0a199482cd52554fbe" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Mega Phoenix brings the concept of the earlier arcade game Phoenix into the 90s, to the extent that a coin-op version was later made by Gaelco. The game is a single-screen shoot ‘em up in which the player moves left to right while shooting several waves. There is a shield function available, which lasts for a short period of time (after which it must recharge to be used again) and it paralyses the craft while active.

The first waves consist of several small alien beings in a set pattern, which move down from the fleet towards the player at random intervals- contacts with these kills the player. Deadly phoenixes firing at you come next, followed by the Mega Phoenix itself and then a final boss, before it all repeats with higher difficulty.

The idyllic life of the Alurean people was shattered when the King is killed by a dragon, and a range of nasties inhabit the lands. Fortunately his twin sons have come to the rescue, and you must take control of one or the other to put the world right.
The boys have differing skills - one is more skilled in sword-fighting (which you are always armed with), the other in magic (available in limited amounts on each level). You collect coins as the game goes on, and spend these in the shop on extra magic, extra lives and enhanced swords.
There are 3 levels on offer - Earth, The Heavens and The Sea, and these can be tackled in any order. The first is straight platform action, the second involves jumping across clouds, and the third sees your characters swim. After those are completed, you must venture into the Monster Castle and finally slay the dragon.</resource>

The gameplay is somewhat reminiscent of Gobliins - the player must clear a &amp;quot;stage&amp;quot; before moving to a next one - but we do get more freedom to roam later on. Tricky inventory-based puzzles are accompanied with a lot of humor. Almost all conversations are automatic.

    <resource id="64f8d6e11016a00285711c38b6ef602a01c0f9cb" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">In this third part of the Mercenary series you have to enlarge your previous success by getting as much money as you can within 24 hours. To do this you visit the locations of that solar system with either some public transport, or you also can find your old star glider. There is also a teleportation system, which speeds things up. Initially you are struck by the size of the accessible area, but eventually you explore the area and you find single tasks, the completion of which
brings you money.

The buildings are nicely constructed, although a bit distant from each other, so there are large areas of nothing, but on the other hand you don't need to walk between them. Unlike in other adventures there's not only one way to complete the game, so your chances of solving it is increased significantly. The graphics are reasonably fast on a powerful Amiga, so it's really fun to play it if you get into it. The position of your game can be saved every time on one of the 10 slots.

As far as gameplay goes though, it's a winner. Perhaps a bit too slow moving for hard-bitten arcade fans, but for those who like to ponder over problems rather than leaping in feet first all guns blazing, it's the closest you're going to get to virtual reality on your Amiga. And it's a damn sight more interesting as well. A large, bulging sack of gorgeousness.</resource>

    <resource id="4a3b2b2bd85c823d33b5604b1b0e949ceda74508" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Metal Mutant is an action game, where you control the eponymous machine, sent to the planet Kronox to find and destroy the insane computer AROD 7. Each level is not side-scrolling fluidly, but is divided into separate screens; upon getting to the edge of one screen you move to the next one. 

The Metal Mutant has the ability to transform into 3 different forms: humanoid, dinosaur and tank. Each form has different capabilities. For instance, the humanoid form can jump and the tank can shoot missiles. You'll need to change form often depending on the situation, as most obstacles and enemies can be only beaten by a specific form. 

Throughout the game, apart from fighting enemies (and bosses), jumping, climbing and so on, you will find additional upgrades which will give you more abilities. You'll also encounter recharge station where you can regain health.

Domark's sim puts you in the cockpit of a MiG in Soviet service, from pilot's school to combat. Sadly there's no sim to pit the MiG against the USAF or RAF, but five combat missions take in photo-reconnaissance in the Arctic, air-to-air combat over China, strafing terrorist trucks, a bombing raid against oil installations and destroying a nuclear reactor. The latter is the final mission (requiring 500 points to enter) which involves taking out air defences and landing on a runway to rearm.

As you'd expect there's a savable pilot's service record but sadly no weapons selection Ã¢â‚¬â€œ you always fly with the same mix of cannon, unguided rockets plus air-to-ground and air-to-air missiles.</resource>

You view the game slightly behind your plane, which must shoot out enemy planes, tanks and installations while avoiding their fire. You are armed with different kinds of weapons including downward bombs, air-to-air missiles and a nuclear bomb. More of each of these can be picked up by collecting the parachutes which are dropped into your path. There are mountain ranges, deserts and arctic scenes to clear along the way, with big boss planes to face.

Well, all is not as it seems. Inside the tower Mickey is fighting for peace, justice and the American way.

Merlin the magician has had his magic wand stolen by the evil Ogre King. The wand has been split into four pieces and given to witches at the top of the towers in the castle. The ogre has put ghosties and ghoulies and things in the towers to try and stop you from getting the wand back together, but you are armed with a squirt gun and a hammer to deal with them. Eventually you just seal up the doors and stop them from emerging. This is done by entering a series of sub-games: The Puddle Maze, The bubble Machine, The Pump Room and The Dripping Taps. At the top of each tower is a guardian thingie that must be shot in the head to retrieve a piece of the wand.

In my experience, cartoon character licences very rarely make good computer games, but I'm glad to say that the most famous of them all has managed to keep his reputation by spawning a cracker of a game. The graphics are nicely detailed and coloured, the ghostly music is more funny than spooky, creating exactly the right atmosphere to suit the already amusing gameplay - smacking teddy bears over the head is great fun.</resource>

The Sports Cars race on the desktop, 4x4s in the sandpit, Formula 1 cars on a snooker table, and so on.

These levels were packed with variation. The Snooker tables has the track painted on, although this is open to deviation (as are most levels), and had you racing through the pockets and across the rim of the table. Tanks raced as well, with the chance of shooting out your opponent if they got directly in front of you. The desktop levels include binders to jump across, pencil-sharpeners to avoid, and lots of visual jokes in the open homework.</resource>

Greens: The Ultimate 3-D Golf Simulation is full of options. A dozen game types can be played on six different courses by up to four human players. A handicap system is included to allow novices and experts to play together. In one player mode the 'ranking list' allows players to play head-to-head against computer opponents of varying skill and rise in the ranks.

Hitting the ball is done using same control system pioneered in Leaderboard and used in most golf games. First click on the mouse button starts the back swing, second sets the force and final click sets the snap.

Greens: The Ultimate 3-D Golf Simulation is a great golf simulation for the Amiga. Its system requirements are modest meaning even A500 owners will be able to play it properly. Like other golf sims it's appeal is limited to fans of this genre, but for those looking for a good, challenging sports simulation, they could do much worse than selecting this golf game from the flight simulation experts.</resource>

Some quite funny movements and shots are available (e.g. banana flanks). The Indoor game has US soccer teams and plays on a much smaller field. It has different rules compared to outdoor soccer. You can play single matches, league and All Star tournament. The same movements and shots can be made, sometimes with even funnier effects (e.g. banana shot bouncing of the wall and into goal).</resource>

I was fairly looking forward to what sounded like a lively and zap-crazed Tempest derivative. But yet again, in what's becoming a horribly familiar scenario, shattered dreams were the order of the day. It all starts promisingly, and for the first few minutes you think 'Yeah, corking stuff!' as you whizz around the rim of a circle blazing away heroically at the pulsating horde of tiny amoeba-like baddies throbbing their way out at you.

Sadly, an hour and a half later when you're on level 53 with all your lives still intact and the difficulty level not significantly higher than it was at the start you begin to have doubts. I ended up playing this one-handed while conducting a telephone conversation and not even watching the screen, and I still couldn't get killed. It's all lushly presented and professionally done, but this is strictly for those of you who find Fun School 4 too taxing.

Very nicely done, but an unutterably dull game beneath the attractive facade. For the terminally untalented only.</resource>

Crimson has kidnapped your scientist grandfather and five more of your relatives, and aims to put his advanced plans to evil use.

Take control of a Resistance fighter in this scrolling shoot 'em up consisting of nine platform-based levels, each ending with a Boss to defeat. Your enemies appear on foot and in vehicles, and Crimson has also planted machine gun bays en route. 

Dead enemies release keys, which can be traded in at shop points for weapons. These weapons include machine guns and flamethrowers, for which ammunition must be bought - weapons are discarded when you have no suitable ammo. The control system is unusual - you can shoot in different directions and crawl along low ledges.

As a special agent of the federation you must complete top secret missions designed to initiate rebellion among the Saharan people. I am glad to say that this game is much better than the excellent original. The game boasts a staggering 1,000,000 square miles of terrain for you to explore, utilising 22 different modes of transportation with which to get around.

Embark on a glorious journey then save the world of CRON and yourself.

A balanced party is a necessity in this game. There are several locations and items that are restricted to certain genders, alignments, or races. A party made up of Good Human Males won't get you very far. Time plays a large role in this game. Time travel is a part of it, but on a more basic level, you will find that characters age as the game goes on. If you wait too long, your characters' statistics will change to reflect their aging.

Although M&amp;M II is polished to fairly high sheen and is interesting to delve in to it's not a thinking player's game, but if you like a lot of mapping interspersed with the odd hack' n 'slay bout then you Might think this RPG Magic.</resource>

However, the great battle between the guardians Corak and Sheltem continued in another place - the world of Terra, where Sheltem was originally appointed as a guardian. Revolting against the powerful race of the Ancients, Sheltem takes possession of their space-traveling nacelles, hurling them at the suns of other planets. It is now up to a group of local adventurers to help Corak and vanquish Sheltem once and for all.

Isles of Terra is the third installment in the Might and Magic series, and a sequel to Gates to Another World. Like its predecessors, it is a role-playing game focusing on first-person exploration of vast pseudo-3D environments, character building, and turn-based combat. The five selectable races remain the same as in the previous games, as well as the eight character classes with the addition of two new ones: Druid and Ranger. Like in the second game, characters may learn unique skills such as thievery, swimming, merchant, and others.

This installment does away with random or pre-set enemy encounters, featuring instead enemies dynamically roaming the game world, allowing to initiate combat from a distance (for example with ranged attacks or spells). There is no option to bribe or surrender to enemies, and escaping combat can be accomplished simply by moving away, unless the enemies have already locked on the party. An automap feature is available at all times, and the player is also allowed to save the game at any time.</resource>

Each level is split into two parts; an action zone and a Royal Palace room. The mechanics and level designs of the Royal Palace rooms are directly lifted from Bomb Jack. Action zones can be split up into several portions, and contain power-ups usually hidden in treasure chests such as money bags, Mighty Coins and Mighty Drinks. Mighty Coins allow Jack to change colors; blue allows Jack to open orange treasure chests, orange allows him to open any treasure chest by simply touching it from the side, and green transforms all enemies on the screen into coins for 5 seconds. Mighty Drinks add 10 seconds to the game's timer. Secret passages can also be found in the action zones, activated by finding a Sphinx in a visible or hidden treasure chest.</resource>

You can play against the computer or another human; either way, select a specialist subject and 2 team-mate graphics (all representing white people). The overall style and presentation are very similar to Elite's earlier A Question of Sport license.

In the first round you select one of twelve random questions from the Jukebox, each of which has four options. A correct answer earns you two points, while an incorrect answer gives your opponent the chance to steal for one point. In round 2 you get three clues to name a star - you get three points for guessing from one clue, two points from two, and one point if you need all 3. In round three, choose an Easy question (from your category) for one point, or a Hard one (from someone else's) for two.

Round four asks you to Guess The Year that a set of events happened in, with scoring the same as round 2. Then comes the quickfire round - answer up to nine questions in 45 seconds, with a 2-second penalty for an incorrect answer. Finally, the six remaining Jukebox pictures are revealed and answered.

To this purpose, players might make use of loads of Mortal-Kombat and Street-Fighter-like special moves, in addition to many others, directly taken from lots of famous videogames or films. Besides, there are bombs, Fire'n'forget rockets, heat-seeking missiles at their complete disposal... The game boasts an amusing animated intro which will explain the reason of such a strange tournament - by the way, your order is to climb a high mountain, just like the second episode of the Mortal Kombat saga; moreover, it features several victory and defeat pictures and an even more crazy final sequence than the intro!

Players can choose their characters from a range of twelve different guys, each distinguished with typical characteristics, which can be edited in the proper menu. Beyond every human conceiving, the game is spangled with lots of mad things, like referee-slaughtering, animals which will appear in the field, VIPs which will perform during the match, and a mysterious tapir named Fart (main character of the game, as you can be able to guess from the introduction) which will perform in a number of funny anims. At the beginning of the match the players will enter the field and choose the field in which play with an incredible money trowing!

Of course, the sporting side of the game is not to be underestimated. You'll always have to win your match! From this point of view, the game is classically structured: pitch type, number of sets to win, type of game (single, double or training), as well as the type of tournament to join; you'll be able to select, in addition to the above-mentioned MK-style tournament, an UNFRIENDLY tournament in which up to eight human players are allowed to take part, or a full season, where player will have to win as much as possible to travel all over the world, and in order to buy weapons and points which will help him in his short career. It's possible to save and subsequently restore your season from disc as well as every change made in the players editing menu, where you're able to change the name, the characteristics and the shirt colour of all the characters... Well, that's all, there's nothing left but wishing you to enjoy Mikro Mortal Tennis! Mikro Mortal Tennis supports all Amiga models with at least 1 Meg of Ram.</resource>

Set in the 22nd century, the Earth has been destroyed, and the player's mission is to re-establish human colonization of other worlds, beginning with just one outpost and a few hundred survivors on the moon. Success requires maintaining life support, mining and producing resources for more colonies, and defense against a powerful alien race bent on humanity's destruction.</resource>

The aim of the first level was to connect a path from a certain location to a specific crystal in the brain by using the correct avatars with the correct landscape type, all the while defending against hostile enemies (that decreased in frequency as the player approached the destination). In the second level, the player had to guide the avatar around a maze full of pulsing neurons to locate a pyramidal Ã¢â‚¬Å“shard of sanityÃ¢â‚¬Â using audio cues. Touching a neuron while it pulsed meant instant death, so good timing was required to collect the pyramid and return to the neuron-surrounded exit. The last stage required the player to complete a Rorschach-inspired colour-cycling puzzle in order to replace the shard. The levels looped several times before the restoration of the physicistÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sanity.</resource>

On each of the 50 levels you must guide it from a starting point to an ending point, taking out all the enemies along the way. Rotating each of the many mirrors on the level to send the beam onto the points the enemies hover over does this – reaching many of them will involve several attempts at finding the right combination of angles. Rotating barriers, light bulb switches and locked sections must all be taken into account, but there are also magic balloons later on. All this must be done within a time limit, and directing the beam back into itself causes overloads and must be avoided, Tron-style.

    <resource id="cad6f1b1596296182e0147c2a33c0992d3f9c1b9" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Mindfighter is one of the best post-apocalyptic adventures ever made, although sadly not many people played it when the game was released in 1988.

The game is based on the prophecies of 16th century French prophet Nostradamus, who predicted that the third world war would erupt in late 20th century, beginning somewhere in the Middle East. You play four people with para-psychological powers living in Southampton, who are trying to help Robin, your 11-year-old boy friend whose mind is trapped in a nightmarish future. Robin's immense para-psychological powers allow you to control other people's minds, as well as metamorphose into various animals. Curious to find the results of an upcoming exam, Robin projected his mind forward in time - only to discover himself in a post-holocaust Southampton where famine, radioactive fallout, and rabble is everywhere, and people are enslaved by an evil order called the System. While Robin's physical body lies inert in 20th century, you must help him fight the System and eventually prevent the war itself from happening.

The game's hallmark is the excellent, extremely atmospheric writing that evokes the true horrors of nuclear holocaust. Puzzles are mostly logical and believable. As well as more typical adventure problems, Mindfighter challenges you to survive the real-life problems that you would face when trying to survive as an outcast in this fascist state.

Overall, Mindfighter is a thoroughly entertaining, serious, and thought-provoking game, which draws you into the brutal reality of the future. Although the game sounds a bit dogmatic at times, it is never really overbearing, and the intriguing plot and well-written characters will keep you interested for hours on end. Highly recommended.</resource>

Hazards include sand traps, tunnels and tubes, running water, and a windmill where you have to get the timing right to knock the ball between the spinning blades. The view is top-down, and contours in the course are represented using shades of color: the lowest parts are dark green, gradually changing to a lighter green to indicate an upward incline.</resource>

And even if you are not a Tetris fan you will be one after a few bouts on this game. Minskies Furballs is one excellent Tetris clone.

It is bright, it is colourful and it is easy to play. All you have got to do is manipulate the oncoming coloured blocks into matching groups of four or more. Each time you do this you send a fish symbol or little grey blocks down on your opponent's side mucking up their arrangements so they have got to get rid of them.

As well as grouping your blocks together you have got a variety of weapons at your disposal. There are three offensive weapons and three defensive ones. A red bar at the bottom increases as you progress through the game and so does your weapon status.

That gripe aside, control is easy enough, press down on the joystick to speed up the blocks, up to select weapons and left and right to move the blocks around. Likewise on the keyboard use left and cursor keys to move either way, right Amiga and right Alt to rotate the blocks.

Minskies is totally addictive and great fun to play. The in-game tune and the little shouts of &amp;quot;here we go&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;you're in trouble now&amp;quot; add to the overall enjoyment. The only problem I have with it was that, at times, there did not seem to be much difference between easy, medium and hard mode.</resource>

Combat is also played in a 2D side-scrolling view similar to fighting games, having a wide range of attacks to use, even including shurikens and fireballs if the character is experienced enough.</resource>

There are three kinds of moon - sand, green and ice, and you may visit all or only one of them. Sitting in the cockpit, you may speed up or turn your space jet, and blast off the enemy. Keep an eye on the scanner to see which directions and distances have threats, and watch the shield level - one this reaches zero, a shot will force you to eject. Points are accumulated for shots fired and time survived.

The action is viewed from above and behind the car, in a similar manner to the OutRun and Lotus games. 

Gameplay is a sort of reverse Chase H.Q., as you aim to flee Sheriff Sam's staff, without destroying your car or running out of time. As well as typical car upgrades, between stages you can also buy maps, which will help you plan your route.

The game's atmosphere includes banjo-based background music and CB radio sounds, for that authentic Midwest feel.

The player travels over the moon, visits the settlements and buys/sells one of the 18 different goods. Of course it is important to know where which product is needed in order to receive a good profit. This should not just be saved but also reinvested into weapon upgrades (additionally to the starting laser shot, homing missiles and mines) to survive space pirate attacks. The player may also choose to go into the pirate business and attack freighters. The ship has a high-speed travel motor to speed up the traveling time between settlements after choosing them on the navigation computer. There are also some missions to do.</resource>

However, if you choose to play with only one player/knight, the other three will be the computer rivals. Wandering through the map, you can visit enchanted places, towns where you can buy equipment or try your luck in gambling, but mostly visited places on the map will be cabins which represents the places where certain enemy beasts are. Each spot has about two or more beasts which after defeating them can be rewarding in a certain way, depending on game's randomize placement.</resource>

You then need to find the waiting motorbike to escape to level 2 - Michaelsville. Here you need to find orbs which transform your bike into the glittering Stratus car able to leap barriers. If you get far enough you escape via a jetski. Level 3 has you defending yourself in Club 30 against Mr Big's task force. And the final level has you in an arena fighting Mr Big's Storm Troopers and plasma cannon as Moonwalker himself - survive and save the children.</resource>

Even Darth Vader sounds German.). Now he's been split into his 4 component parts, represented by liquid, gas, a hard ball and a bouncy ball, and he must get through 24 levels (36 on the special A1200 version - mirroring the game's plot-line of improved technology causing more problems for Morris) to retrieve the parts of the machine so it can be rebuilt to bring him back to life.

The gameplay is vaguely influenced by Lemmings, as the levels are populated by lots of points which can't be crossed in all forms - walls, fires, gaps, thornbushes and suchlike. You get a set number of transformations on each level, although extra ones can be picked up at times, and there are heaters and freezers dotted around which cause transformations in some states. All this is done against a time limit. Like Lemmings 2, you can take on the next level in each of the worlds at any time, so you have to be stuck 4 times before you can't progress.

Shang was accompanied by Prince Goro, a warrior of the Shokan race (a four armed half-human/half-dragon). Knowing that if ten tournaments in a row were won by the Outworld champion, the Earth Realm would be conquered by evil and fall into darkness, Shang entered Goro in the tournament and had him defeat the great Kung Lao. Goro has been  reigning supreme as the undefeated fighting champion for five hundred years now. As the last tournament required draws near, Raiden, Thunder God and protector of the Earth Realm, enacts a plan to tip the scales in the humans favor, Seven fighters step into the arena on Shang Tsung's mysterious island: Shaolin warrior Liu Kang, Special Forces operative Sonya Blade, the mercenary thug Kano, fame-seeking actor Johnny Cage, the ice wielding Lin Kuei warrior Sub-Zero and his undead adversary Scorpion, and Raiden himself.

Mortal Kombat is a side-scrolling 1 on 1 fighting game. Fighting is set as one on one kombat, allowing each player to perform a variety of punches, kicks, and special moves in order to defeat their opponent.  When the opponent faces their second round loss, the winner can perform a finishing move called a &amp;quot;Fatality&amp;quot; on the loser.  The Fatality is a move unique to each fighter that graphically kills the loser in a blood-soaked finale.

Mortal Kombat began its life as a 2-player arcade title. It is notable for its use of digitized actors to represent the game's fighters, as well as its use of copious amounts of blood during gameplay.

    <resource id="0ce4caae6262095977a1bf5cf8817b6a959c5c18" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">If this game looks vaguely familiar, that's probably because you've seen it before, only it was called Smidge which we reckoned was  far better than most full-price games.

Morton Strikes Back is accessible with addictive gameplay and super smooth parallax scrolling, over 80 levels across 11 different worlds, many difficulty levels'. It is a platform game featuring a Mr Man type character with the legs and rickets. And penguins. As far as platform games go, there's little new or exciting about Morton. You jump on baddies' heads to kill them, collect corns and fruit for points, hearts to regain lost hit points. You start off at the left, head right and occasionally there are secret rooms to be found. The only major difference of course is the penguins.

The plain fact is that if you really feel like you need another platform game then you should download it right now, and of course you get penguins in it.</resource>

You must reach the bottom within the time limit, remaining within the track boundaries and avoiding hazards including water, logs and stationary cars. The faster you complete the course, the more prize money you receive. Repairs to any damage to the bike (incurred by contact with the aforementioned hazards) must be paid for from this, but the rest can be spent on upgrades. The controls are rotational, with the fire button or space used for wheelies.

Your fellow band members have been kidnapped by fans of other music genres. Our bass-guitar-wielding hero goes on a Double Dragon-esque journey in this side-scrolling beat 'em up. On each level Lemmy heads right, occasionally stopping to fight a group of enemies who pop up in hopes of beating him up. 

Throughout 6 levels, each of them representing a different genre, you'll not only beat up the enemies with your trusty instrument, but also use various powers - such as an incinerating belch or a deadly bass guitar solo. You'll need to collect powerups that come out of defeated enemies - some of them will heal you, some will give you the energy necessary to use for your powers. After each level (except for the last one) you play a short minigame.

It's essentially a platform game, but the 60 levels are reliant on you colouring in enough of the screen, by walking over it. Power ups are on offer, and the levels include some interesting design features, including ladders, spikes and springs to bounce off.

You can switch between the 3 characters (Mr Blobby, Mrs Blobby and Baby Blobby) at any point, and only lose once all 3 are out of lives. There are plenty of bad guys around, all looking identical and following pre-programmed attack paths.

You control Mr. Do, a clown, and guide him trough a field with varying elevation levels, with balls placed on it. You must collect those balls to replenish your weapon, a ball that you throw at your enemies. A trail (shown as a line) follows you while moving around. The area you moved turns gray and will be uncovered. All the balls in that gray area turn into cherries. And, if you do the same with the cherries, they will be upgraded to oranges. The oranges can be upgraded to lemons and finally the lemons upgraded to pineapples. Hidden under the field is a letter (in the shape of a coin), which can be used for the &amp;quot;EXTRA&amp;quot; at the top of the screen. When any of the letters that spell the word &amp;quot;EXTRA&amp;quot; are collected an army of enemies that follows you show up and one of those enemies holds the letter that you touched. To obtain the letter you must kill that enemy. Now you can collect the other letters. When you obtained all the letters that spell the word &amp;quot;EXTRA&amp;quot; you will receive a bonus. On the field are logs, which can be unleashed by walking next to the side that is propped up. The log rolls down and kills all enemies it rolls over. But be careful! It can kill you too! To continue to the next round, you can kill all enemies or collect all the balls or fruits.</resource>

As well as enemies, there are many blocks on the levels. The weapon upgrade system is build into these, which function in two different ways. Most will drop crystals, which if collected are added to your cash total. The others reveal a picture of a weapon with a price - make contact with it while carrying enough credits and you will buy this weapon. When your energy bar runs out you lose a life; when this happens you lose all your money.

Funny game this. The sounds and graphics were an absolute joy but the gameplay was awful. Controlling the character is close to impossible. You are given three lives but if you collect all the items you need and then die, the level is impossible to complete because you no longer have the weapon you need to beat the boss. The time limits are ridiculous and the logic needed to beat the bosses is bizarre. Add to that the 'English' translation of the story is totally incomprehensible.

Yet the graphics, sound and the fact that there is a bit of parallax scrolling thrown in to each level makes you desperately want to overlook all of the blindingly obvious flaws. There's just something about it which is addictive.</resource>

You can decide to be several different people and the game is created after the way you make your choice. The game engine and interface are pretty simple as all you have to do is to deploy units, offer support to your allies and decide on what military you are going to need.

Depending on what you choose to do the news will change in the a newspaper you can read (the is how the game tells about all events in the game) which is rather nice, because that makes the overview of the game very good. The game does offer pretty good graphics all though it isn't really needed for a game like this. But is definitely a plus.</resource>

To do this, you must get through the game's eight stages, with over ten sectors like the junkyard, subway, drug lab, nursery, downtown, Sunset Strip, and even the corporation, where Mr. Big resides. In order to get through the stages, you are required to collect a number of safe cards, and insert them in the slot next to the stage exit.  Each sector includes a map, and should be easy to read. For example, the blue or red dots represent you, and the white dots are the missile launchers, while the &amp;quot;E&amp;quot; indicates the exit.

Your mission ain't going to be easy, as you will come face-to-face with enemies including the canine mutts, Das Lof Gang, Dr. Spike Rush, Joe Rockhead, Kinky Pinky, Sgt. Skyhigh, HQ Posse, and Mr. Big himself. You have two ways you can deal with them: either put a bullet in them or make arrests. Furthermore, they will try to blow you up the minute they see you. Fortunately, you're armed with a shotgun and missile launcher, but these both have a limited supply of ammunition. If your bullet counter reaches one, you can only fire one bullet at a time, so you need to find some more. Also, it is important not to waste all of your missiles: you might need them later when you deal with later enemies like Mr. Big. You are also backed up by a chopper and a mean shiny street machine.

More often than not, when you blow up enemies, you can pick up several items that they drop, including drugs, money, ammunition, missile launchers, and if you're lucky, safe cards.  Even if you got the safe card and can pass the level, you can keep blowing up enemies to score more points. According to the game, this game is for training purposes only, so you will not get employed by your local DEA office. Is this what the DEA does every day: go on rampages?

Each screen is separate from the others, and involves trying to collect a key and then progress through the exit. Enemies are best dealt with by shooting one of your longer-range weapons towards them and waiting for it to hit them - this will release at least one coin, for points. Improved weapons can be collected, each of which functions for a limited number of shots.  Bonus items are often located in the more precarious parts of the level, leading you to choose whether to risk losing a life, and going back to the start of the screen (although previously killed creatures remain dead when you lose a life)

    <resource id="3b1b6dff36822262b8b4ade48b4aece020e6d24b" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Arc Developments created a 3D game world called Reality3 for this simulation, licensed around one of Britain's top players. There are two courses, plus a hidden 9-hole course on Mars with reduced gravity, with match play and stroke play options against one of 8 varied-difficulty computer players.

The control system is quite unusual, as the strength of the shot is chosen before you start the swing, but you have to click within a range to activate the shot, and this range is narrower if your shot is intended to be more powerful. An extra click can be made to add wrist snap, which increases the shot's power. The wind calculation is more complicated than most games of the era, and the rough is harder to play out of than usual, as you can't make slight stance adjustments easily.

The levels are colourful, and the game has a cute look making it appear suited to younger players. Mirrors are placed around the levels, which transport you to a random place.</resource>

During the travels, Nicky is able to move around the levels, jump over obstacles, and duck to avoid flying threats. Nicky must collect gems, flying bombs, dynamite, keys, and other specific objects. These are used for tasks such as building a bridge over river throwing logs, climbing ladders, using teleporters, or to break the walls to find the secret areas. 

Enemy creatures are taken out by throwing apple remnants at them or jumping on them. Nicky's energy is drained if he makes contact with them in any other way. As you do all this, a score is calculated, and then listed in the high score table. Passwords are offered to allow you to resume from a previously-reached level.

This is important because the game is very much a simulation rather than an action game.

Before each race you have to do three qualifying laps, and only make the grid if you are fast enough to meet the pre-defined qualifying limit. The races can be between 5 and 20 laps, or at full length if you prefer - fortunately a half-finished season can be saved to cassette or disk. 

F1 cars of this era have turbo boosts, and this is available in the game to provide a quick blast of extra speed, which is useful for overtaking but can cause the turbo or the engine itself to be overstressed, as well as using fuel more quickly (pitstops are for tires but not fuel, again in keeping with the era's real Formula 1 rules).

The game was pitched somewhere in between a full-blown simulation like F1 GP and action games like Continental Circus. Only 12 cars were in each race, which could last from between 3 and 20 laps.

Before each race you can customize wing downforce, gear ratio, tyre selection and fuel load choices – pitstops are a standard feature of the longer races. The 16-bit versions include a unique 'Improve With Mansell' mode, in which a digitized version of Nigel's head appears in the top corner of the screen, offering instructions and praise.

Enemies encountered include priests with holy water, vultures, and even the police.

NightHunter is a traditional side scrolling platform game that is made up of 30 levels.  Each level has 20 screens.  To advance to the next level 8 objects must be collected; 3 parchments and 5 keys.  Every 5th level you obtain one of the medallions.

Beware of daybreak! You will die if you don't locate a crypt to protect yourself from the sunlight.

His attempts at gaining acceptable go wrong when he is bitten by a cannibal, and the Police of Earth find Midian and set out to destroy it. Boone must stop them.

The game has several different sequences, most arcade based, trying to bring sequences from the movie to life on the computer screen.

To accomplish this task Moonlight is armed with a katana, shurikens, bombs, and a sickle and chain weapon. Each weapon offers its own advantages and must be used at certain times to overcome specific obstacles or opponents. 

The game's coin-op origins are evident in the fact that it does not have passwords or saves. To compensate for this, however, adjustable difficulty settings were added.

As with the follow-up, players take the role of three different heroes - Doug, the smart safe cracker; Dino, the strong, but dumb, boxer; and Donna, the sexy club dancer. 

The game takes place in Tokyo. While all three characters explore almost the same areas, each of the heroes has their own story to follow and puzzles to solve. You can choose which character you would like to play first and when you have finished all three sub-plots, you'll get a final with all three characters acting altogether.

The game features cartoonish, comics-style graphics, unique icon-based interface and non-linear plot. It is also full of Italian humour, and the game is played more like a comedy, rather then crime-based adventure.</resource>

Later on ported to the Amiga, but unfortunately never got published as the publisher went bankrupt.

The game has average graphics and relatively good music, but the controls are horrible. The basic idea is well known - you must climb up the level to escape the raising water level.

I remember the fuss with magazines banging on about demo coders should be making games, and this game shows why that wasn't necessarily the case.</resource>

It presents a satirical, cartoonish nuclear battle between five world powers, in which the winner is whoever retains some population when everyone else on earth is dead.
The game's introduction includes an homage to Dr. Strangelove. Each player - one human, four computer-controlled - is represented by a caricature of a national leader (the MS-DOS version allowed more than one human player). If there is a computer-controlled winner at the end of the game, that leader is depicted jumping for joy in the middle of a blasted wasteland, crowing &amp;quot;I won! I won!&amp;quot;. If the player wins only the high score board is shown. Once a player (computer or human) loses, all of their stockpiled weapons are automatically launched. It's possible for a game to have no winner because of this. If this happens, a cut scene of the earth shattering and exploding is shown, and the high score table appears (though without any new entries).</resource>

The player controls a space ship and must destroy the electric core of a synthetic planet called Cetorium to defeat a dangerous alien race. He flies left to right and collects bonuses and power ups to increase the ship's firepower. Extra weapons look like the levitating options from Gradius,but there are several types. Various enemies have to be shot and at the end of levels there are fights against large bosses. The game has a specific organic/plant style with resemblance to X Multiply. Most of the enemies aren't space ships but rather bugs and bacteria-like creatures. Also the game's environments look organic. The game has one-hit-death and the player has only a few ships to use.

There are seven big, multi-directional scrolling levels which need to be conquered by finding all hidden crystals. The first three are available right from the start and the others gradually open up as a more crystals are found. A lot of time is spent with jumping over gaps and fighting the uncle's soldier with the sword, but there are many puzzles to solve. Much consists of the standard &amp;quot;finding an object and bringing it to the right spot&amp;quot;, but the big catch is that the hero can transform into animals, e.g. a lion or a bird. Each animal has their own set of abilities which are needed to solve the obstacles the game throws at the player.</resource>

It's your job, as the player, not to control the tanks in real time, but to learn a programming language designed for the game to build an artificial intelligence that will allow the tank to survive. Omega includes a massive manual that needs to be read before tackling the game.

The user can select to play either to a certain score or for a certain amount of time.  When on offense, the player can rotate to keep away from his rival, take a shot from a distance or move in to the basket for special up-close slam-dunks.  When on defense, you can try to take your rival's ball or jump up to block a shot.  Particularly good set-ups get a slow-motion replay.  You can even smash the glass on the backboard, which will send an irate janitor onto the court to clean up the mess.

The bulk of the game is side-scrolling platform hack 'n' slash action, with mines to avoid on the route. You can collect a number of spells, and select them using the function keys. Your physical and mental energy are measured separately throughout the game, and must both be kept high.

Once on the surface, he must complete 5 survival boot camps and become the Legion-Command Officer or die trying.

A sidescrolling action-adventure developed by WJS Design and published by Psygnosis (Shadow of the Beast, Leander), Ork features five expansive levels characteristic of Psygnosis games of the era. While slightly similar to the same firm's earlier Killing Game Show, Ork's presentation is more polished, and the gameplay is less hectic. 

In addition to blasting enemies, the player must complete tasks reminiscent of adventure games. Examples including locating and delivering a payment to a gate keeper, finding a specific key to open a door, or locating an orb to deflect lasers.

Essentially this is a game in which the player patrols the top of the castle and drops rocks onto the Orkish enemies who are trying to scale the wall. Should an Ork make it to the top then the player can call for their trusty sword and chop of the offending invaders head. What makes this game difficult is that there can only ever be one rock on screen at a time and while the player is holding their sword no new rocks will appear.

Randomly throughout the game a chief Ork will appear. They ascend slower than their companion Orks and can only be killed by dropping a rock on their head. If a chief makes it to the top then it's game over. Between levels there is a time limited bonus round where the player must sweep defeated Ork bodies into the moat.</resource>

The player can race across varied terrain in a readily available Ferrari, complete with a female passenger, over a series of short tracks.

Gameplay is viewed form just above and behind the car. The roads are full of sharp bends and hazards, contact with which can cause the car to roll and lose the player's time. On each section of track there is a fork in the road, allowing the player to choose which direction he or she wishes to go in. The player has to to complete five track sections in total, out of the fifteen in the game.</resource>

The 28 levels are basically a big escort mission: in order to to protect the steadily moving ship, the player has to destroy all opposition waiting ahead in the usual shooter way. However, there are also blocks in the way which need to be destroyed by ramming them into each other. When they are destroyed in the correct way, they reveal power ups like new weapons, weapon upgrades, life energy, or shields. In order to keep the ship from crashing into non-destroyable blocks, the player has to connect to the ship and change the direction it steers to. When connected, the players own ship can't shoot.</resource>

    <resource id="9f1e139a9dc62ebc94f555e5aefe00c34dfeef4a" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Overdrive is practically two games in one. First, you have the arcade game, where you have to race against a succession of drivers, each better than the one before, until you reach the final challenge and claim victory. The second game is a time-trials challenge, where you have to race a variety of vehicles over a number of courses against the clock. This is slightly easier than the arcade version and gives you the option to get some practice in.

You have four different cars to control in Overdrive, ranging from a GP to a Super sports car. All have their own strengths and weaknesses, as you would expect. The controls are very responsive, and it goes without saying that it's incredibly playable. What makes it so tough is the speed. Everything just whips along at such a rate that it's often hard to anticipate corners, and you end up careering all over the shop. Overdrive lets you link up two machines via the null modem cable.

Of course, it can't all be good, or it would have got a mark of 100%. The biggest problem is the horrendous loading times. As the levels vary greatly, the game has to load in complete graphics for each race, which can take a lot longer than the race itself in some cases!</resource>

It all takes place in a post-apocalyptic universe in which a lot of money can be earned by transporting goods form place to place, but the large gangs of Overlanders who already do this are keen to stop you.

Two missions are on offer at a time, one tougher but more lucrative than the other, with half the money paid upfront and the other half on successful completion. Before setting off, you can buy upgrades such as turbo chargers, armour and enhanced weapons, each of which has a limited lifespan. Attacks from other vehicles can come either from guns or attempting ramming, and the roads are poorly-maintained and hazardous, so be careful, or better yet be violent first.

It features 5 courses from across Europe, and 60 top European pros, rather than the US-leaned lineup of the original. The graphics are much more detailed and colorful, as you'd expect considering the intervening years of advances in programming skill.

The control system is the standard three-click method used in most golf games, but you can now define intended draw/fade levels in advance of playing the shot, so that a perfect aim leads to a measured effect, and an imperfect one exaggerating the effect.

As well as the Stroke Play games of the original (where you count the total score across the whole round of 18 holes, and compare this to your opponent), there are also Match Play (where the aim is to win as many individual holes as possible) and Skins (the same, but with money) modes as well.

    <resource id="efb20dad0bebe42274b95c1519e3dd5fcedbc0c3" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">In this platform game featuring over 2500 screens, our hero is in search of hidden treasures across worlds such as caves and castles, and must collect it all to advance onto the next level. The twist, as you may guess from the title, is that his weapon is a hammer which can be used to burrow into the ground. The blocks quickly reappear though, which can be fatal if they trap him, but can also be used by the cunning player to trap an enemy. 

Not all the platforms and transporters on the levels are visible, which guarantees an element of Rick Dangerous-style trial and error. You have six lives, which isn't much considering that failing to complete a level within the time limit costs a life, and contact with enemies is costly (you can't drill through them Worms-style)

Now equipped with arms, face, and legs, Pac must guide a fairy back to her home in Fairy Land, but this task will not be easy because Inky, Blinky, Pinky, Clyde, and Sue will pursue Pac-Man as he travels through Pac-Land. When he finally transports the fairy back to her home, Pac is given some magic shoes, which will help him get to his own home, where he will be greeted by his family: Ms. Pac-Man, Baby Pac-Man, Chomp Chomp, and Sourpuss. 

There are sixteen rounds to complete, with four trips each. During each round, he can grab a power pellet, which cause ghosts to turn blue, allowing Pac-Man to eat them for points. Points are also awarded by collecting fruit that appear, like cherries and strawberries. In some rounds, Pac must use a springboard to jump over a lake. He must also make it to the end of each round before time runs out, otherwise a ghost will chase him.

You need to guide Pac-Man around a maze and eat all of the dots on the board in order to proceed on to the next round. Numerous, multi-colored ghosts also roam the maze trying to stop you. If you eat one of the power pellets in the maze, the ghosts will temporarily turn blue and run from you. Pac-man can earn bonus points by eating the ghosts when they are in this state. The maze is now in 3-D and is larger than screen which will scroll to follow the action. To help get out of tight spots, Pac-Man now has the ability to jump. But be careful, because some of the ghosts have learned this trick as well and you could end up in a mid air collision!

You are in complete control of 16 modern American tanks which are divided into 4 squads.

The objective in each mission is usually to take control of key areas, destroy enemy communications, escort support groups, etc. In a nice touch, missions may be undertaken at any time of the day; night missions surprisingly being the easiest, as the enemy has inferior Infrared imaging to your tanks.

The graphics could be best described as 'functional', they certainly aren't to the standards of other war sims like Gunship 2000, but the functions are well laid out, simple and extremely easy to use.

Overall, Pacific Islands is an improvement over Team Yankee, although interface and dumb AI problems still remain. Once the initial problems of controlling 4 groups of 4 tanks are overcome, the rest of the game is quite easy to get into, and very rewarding. Recommended if you like tank sims, but don't expect it to be very realistic.</resource>

Your goal is to destroy the balloons which bounce around the playfield. To accomplish this, you can shoot hooks which travel upwards, and blow up any balloon they touch. Depending on their size, they either split on two smaller ones, or evaporate if they're at their minimum size. Apart from balloons, some levels also have barriers that have to be destroyed with your hooks, since they often block your access to balloons. There are also some barriers which cannot ever be destroyed. Your character has the ability to climb ladders, but cannot jump. 

You can also pick up power-ups such as: the ability to fire two shots at once, the hook that attaches to the ceiling and waits 'til something bumps into it, a gun which has a high rate of fire but cannot destroy barriers. Beside extra weapons, you can also pick certain things like clock (halting time for a small period), dynamite (reducing all balls to minimum size, thus making you able to reach more points), life, and such.

    <resource id="5c5dbb46246b643cb0289cfdf1f68c35e450e8ae" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">The plot follows John Milton's poem from 1667 loosely. You begin your quest to defeat Satan in a cave where you fight various normal and some mid and end level bosses. Afterwards you exit the cave to enter level 2 that leads you through an open area with bridges that is quickly passed. In the next level your goal is to defeat twenty evil creatures and obtain their souls as an ammunition that you'll use against Satan himself. This level is presented in a third person perspective in contrary to the other horizontally scrolling levels. After you've collected the twenty souls, you fall through a hole in the ground to face a hydra. Once you defeat the hydra you finally enter the last stage in which you face Satan himself after a short stage with a Greek ambiance.

The soundtrack matches the atmostphere of the game really well. The coding is well done and you don't see any slowdowns throughout the game. The graphics reach from simple to well drawn and overall fits into the style of the game. The gameplay is simple, but offers variation. Overall it's a short, but interesting visit to the depths of hell.

Paradise Lost was intially sent to HOL by the developer Mert BÃƒÂ¶rÃƒÂ¼ with the request to include the game in HOL in April 2013. Mert included two releases of the game in his upload that the HOL team used to take the screenshots. One version was the original 4 disk release of the game and another one was included with a built-in unlimted energy trainer. Mert BÃƒÂ¶rÃƒÂ¼ kindly gave permission to host both releases directly on OAGD.net, so everybody can experience this long lost Turkish game.</resource>

A fleet of space freighters carry a cargo of battle and security robots to help in the defence of Basmyth. Alien ships were bombarding the freighters with disorienting beams which drove the robots crazy. The human officers were eliminated, leaving the ships open for occupation by alien forces. At this point the players mission starts...

You control a cybernetic influence device (ID) which has been teleported aboard the first freighter to eliminate all the droids and robots. Two ways are possible to clean the ship decks representing the action part and the more strategy part of the game: Shooting (action) to destroy the robots or connecting itself into an other robot's brain (strategy) and take temporarily control of it.

It's possible to play the game as a simple shoot-em-up game, but the main part of Paradroid 90 is the transfer game to take control of other droids.

The Roobikyoub dwarves have been banished from the kingdom, which is not good as they produce high-quality whisky. King Erik is not popular for this decision, as some feel that ale brewers and mineral water bottlers have influenced him. Honest John the trader and Kronos the Magician play a key role in your journey, each offering sub-quests to attempt.

The package includes a novella complete with map and decipherable hints, which are accessed by typing 'hint' followed by the code into the computer. Therefore, those with only a pirated copy would struggle to complete the game.

Your score and the number of locations visited are both displayed in the title bar. The parser allows whole words to be deleted and unaccepted previous entries to be re-edited.

The only playing option is the European Championship tournament of the day, although you can choose the 8 teams from the 26 major European footballing nations of the time (so the USSR, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia are all still complete). Two players can compete in these groups, but there's no guarantee of getting straight to a 2-player game, especially as tournaments (and individual matches) can't be quit out of.

The gameplay features variable strength kicks, determined by how long you hold the fire button for. In a break with realistic physics, the ball ricochets back in the direction it came from. Goalkeepers stay on the goal-line rather than using the whole penalty box.

While no player refuses the sign for your team (even if it's still on the Conference), the real game challenge is to balance finances, and avoid paying too much in wages while still in the lower divisions.</resource>

During combat, you can move each character to the front, middle, or back of the party. It's also possible to aim your spells at different ranks of the enemy.

The levels include ones based around spiders, snakes, dentists and similar, surely including something to scare anyone. To rescue the Galactic Emperor, you must negotiate all of these.

The action is mostly one-dimensional blasting, but with distinct sections of flying to a level, flying around it, and then navigating an underground cavern. A simultaneous 2-player mode exists to make things a little less daunting.</resource>

It's a top-down shoot 'em up resembling Sinistar, with the unusual twist of being mouse-controlled, using the left button to fire and the right button to thrust. You can rotate the direction of fire while holding fire down, allowing you to move one way and fire another way (another Minter tradition - witness Llamatron). A Boost function exists to power up your ship, including plutonium pods which unusually can be collected and harvested by the end-of-level enemies as well as your own ship. After the main levels you must steer the ship through a tight tunnel, avoiding contact with the walls.

So, when the vegetables start attempting to run away from him, he has no choice but to chase after them.

Out to Lunch is a platform game set across 6 countries, starting off in Switzerland and finishing in Paris. To recollect the vegetables he must first stun them, either by firing at them or jumping on them, then walk over them, in a manner similar to Fire &amp; Ice. Unusually, the game was converted from the SNES to the Amiga, not the other way around.</resource>

The pieces are offered in random order, and there are seven different types - straight lines going horizontally or vertically, corners rotating in each of the four directions, and cross-over pieces which carry the flooz straight across horizontally and vertically. Each of these can be entered from either side. When the flooz hits a gap, or a piece which the previous piece can't flow into, the pipe is finished.

Before the flooz starts flowing from its randomly-selected starting position, the player has several seconds to start placing pieces. They can be put down anywhere. However a situation that can often occur is there will be a long and complex piping arrangement set up, yet a gap somewhere remains to be filled. Players are able to replace a piece with another in the same square (to make it easier to flow the flooz that way), but for a slight scoring penalty.</resource>

Nine different types of ships were represented.

The goal of the game is to retire with as much gold and land as possible, as many ranks/titles as possible (Colonel, Admiral, Marquis, Duke), and a wife. Finding long lost relatives helps too. You accomplish these goals by plundering cities, capturing and sinking enemy ships, getting in good with governors to receive titles, learn news of &amp;quot;evil Spaniards&amp;quot; holding your relatives, capturing evil pirates, etc.</resource>

    <resource id="8ca2e67b852da81c0f9d08ccf8aabc42f1eb7aee" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">The film Platoon featured a squad of five soldiers on their mission for the US Army in Vietnam. In this action game based around the film, you take control of these five guys in turn, with the chance to switch between them as they each take one of the 3 hits that would kill them.

The game recreates each of the sections of the film, starting with a side-scrolling journey through the jungle, with paths to cross both horizontally and vertically, and the ability to jump or duck hazards. You will need to blow up a bridge and then locate a village, which contains a torch, a map and a trap-door. The enemy has booby-trapped the area and are launching airstrikes, so the danger is not all from enemy ground soldiers.

The next section is in first-person 3D, as you move through a network of tunnels in search of flares and a compass. There are 3 distinct control methods, changing from the standard motion when an enemy appears (this puts you in control of a cross-hair for more accurate targeting), and when you enter a room to search.

After escaping this you settle in a bunker overnight, and have a limited amount of flares with which to locate incoming enemy, and must then shoot them before they can shoot you. The jungle airstrike from the film is the next moment - you have two minutes to rush into a safe position to the north, using your compass for guidance.

Finally you face the treacherous Sergeant Barnes, and must hit him with grenades 5 times whilst trapped in a foxhole to prevent him wiping you out.

The challenge is to reach the Premier League and survive.

Most of the standard features of management games are present, including pre-match tactics (which are fairly customizable), a full transfer market including short-term loan deals, detailed player statistics (presented visually), ground improvements and coaching.

Playing the matches is optional, as you can simply watch instead. There are 4 playing views, and you can play in position or as a team. Initially your player is by far the best in the team, so choose his position and use him wisely. Once you reach retirement age you can only play the matches for 3 out of every 4 seasons (which is poorly explained by an 'assistant manager' concept, but is more likely an attempt to make the game harder. This would make little sense though, because scoring is very, very hard in player-manager mode).

Before each match you get a video report from renowned pundit Alan Hansen, as well as some form notes which are said to be Hansen's.

Many of the enemies you face are waves of laser fodder with movement patterns taking them around the screen, with gun turrets and firing enemies as well, to fight or avoid. You start with 4 lives, and get an extra one (and a 5000 point bonus) after every level.

In many similar shoot 'em ups, you have unlimited fuel but must pick up ammunition recharges or increased powerups. Plutos lacks weapon upgrades, but rather inventively forces you to refuel, by shooting at posts which contain fuel (there are also bays for 500 bonus points marked out). Each level finishes with an enemy with eyes shooting at you, and from level 3 there are teeth mounted in front which fire at you.

The game is based on real police procedure and adheres carefully to following the rules of police work. Beginning as a patrol officer and working into detectives, Sonny will chase down the infamous Death Angel and put an end to his criminal underworld.

A typical Sierra parser game built with the popular AGI engine, Police Quest differs from the others release by the company in the realism of the setting and travelling, that is done by car, controlled by the player using a overhead view (instead of the cabbie of Leisure Suit Larry or walking around in Space Quest). Some sections of the game require the player to be efficient driving the car (as there are a fair number of chases, and traffic rules also apply to the player).</resource>

After the trial, Sonny's application to the Homicide division was accepted and proposed to Marie, who had her prostitution charges dropped and started a new life away from the streets. Life was good - until Bains escaped, taking advantage of a low-security prison and an inexperienced correctional officer. Sonny is now in danger from a vengeful Bains and is saddled with his new chain-smoker partner Keith. Sonny goes to the field again to capture Bains, but things are about to get awfully personal...

Using Sierra's new SCI engine, the graphics are more vibrant than in the first game, but gameplay remains basically the same, with the player ordering Sonny to move to a place in the scene (either using the directional keys or the new mouse interface) and a parser interface to interact with the game world. Game sequences are more varied, and include a shooting range, an underwater search or searching the inside of an escape vehicle. The driving sequences are gone, and the player can relax while reading the chatter between Sonny and Keith as they move from location to location. The approach to the game, however, is radically different. While the first (for a large part) is based on street police work, this sequel is oriented into forensics field work such as collecting evidences that link Bains into the happenings of the game.</resource>

However, a series of gruesome murders perpetrated by a sinister cult known as &amp;quot;The Kindred&amp;quot; shocks the city. Marie becomes a victim of their attack and falls into a coma. It becomes Sonny's very personal mission to track down the attackers and make them pay for their crimes.

The Kindred is the third installment of the Police Quest series, its events taking place after those described in The Vengeance. The game brings back some of the elements of the first game, such as a modified version of driving sequences and police procedures unrelated to the main plot the protagonist must go through. Computer work is particularly emphasized, requiring the player to perform tasks such as using facial composite software or figuring out murder patterns by studying a map. Like other Sierra adventures of the time, the game uses an icon-based interface for interaction with the environment.</resource>

There is one opponent to compete against (either controlled by the AI or another player) without further possibilities for customization. The control method is divided into two distinct parts: first the basic position of the cue is set in a top down view. After that the game switches to a first-person perspective where the player can fine-tune the cue to select the spin (the game gives the parameters of the current position). Finally the shot is performed with a mouse click. For both parts the player is on a time limit of about ten seconds each.</resource>

The gameplay is quite similar to other games of this type. At the start of the game, the player creates a party of characters (up to 6). Classic AD&amp;D races (dwarf, elf, half-elf, gnome, etc.), character classes (fighter, paladin, monk, wizard, etc.), alignments (Good/Evil and Lawful/Chaotic axis), and statistics (strength, intelligence, wisdom, etc.) are there for the player to choose and adjust. Once the party is created, the player begins the exploration of the city of Phlan. Upon exiting the city, the player explores a top-down map, visiting dungeons and other locations of interest, as well as engaging in combat.</resource>

A Cyborg RX-22 will accompany you during all length of your mission because of his remarkable knowledge of ancient civilizations stored in several gigabytes of its RAM and invisibility to anybody except you.

The Epochs you will visit include:
1) Alaska ( 2112 A.D. ) - present days on the base &amp;quot;Neuronix&amp;quot;;
2) Central Europe ( 85002 B.C. ) - first Homosapiens in  Paleolithic;
3) Highlands of Scotland ( February 16th, 1135 ) - feudal lords and castles near Loch-Ness;
4) Incan Empire ( June 25th, 1527 ) - Indians, Capital of Empire, and Holiday of the Sun;

Why race on flat 2D circuits when you can charge through a multi-textured half-pipe in small aircraft? Typhoon Racing have taken up the challenge, and entered you in their machine.

There are 6 different circuits, with hazards including chicanes, tunnels and crusher gates. Shading to the sections marks out whether a corner or dive is coming up. There are 5 computer opponents to race against in one player mode, while a data link cable allows 2-player games.

Each planet has its own atmosphere, and your machine's filters will need to be set to take account of this. Rain on some circuits necessitates a pitstop for a changeover. You are armed with afterburners, which can provide a speed use in open air but should not be overused. The Amiga version allows you to adjust the sensitivity of the controls - either way, joystick is easier to use but mouse is seen as ultimately being faster.

The game cast the player as a dispossessed warlord plundering his way through 195 territories on the way to world conquest. Several other leaders have the same goal.

The gameworld is now made up of polygons, so the view can be rotated and moved with greater freedom than Populous. Trade, diplomacy, inventions, and scorched earth invasions all play a key role in how the player progressed through the game.  Two-player games via modem links are available on computer versions.

Gods take it in turns to decide on a piece and answer a trivia question. Get it right and you're allowed to move the appropriate character one square in any direction on the multi-coloured board. Try to move on to a square occupied by an opponent piece and you're in for a fightÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ well, a challenge really. Lose a challenge and you're demoted a character grade. There's no grade lower than one so if a grade one piece loses a head-to-head it vaporises and disappears from the board. There's just one snag. If you make all your opponents disappear there's going to be nobody left to praise the smartypants. Serves you right, clever clogs!</resource>

The game is not a faithfully conversion of the movie however - your unit has already been killed off when the game starts and you will battle scorpions, enemy soldiers and dodge obstacles etc, before facing the Predator itself a number of times.

The game is a fairly standard run-jump-shoot platformer, except that you start with no weapons at all and must collect them as the game goes on.

The game is a crosshair shooter influenced by Operation Wolf. The viewpoint is from slightly behind Harrington, while the game scrolls on as you clear each section. Mouse control is offered on 16-bit versions. Your armour must be kept functional by collecting top-ups, and there are weapon power-ups such as machine guns and rocket launchers to be had. You can't go in all-guns-blazing however, as killing a single innocent causes Harrington to lose his job.</resource>

These include fire-breathing Pyro-Tax dragons, the Turtosaurus, and the Bad Bat. Each of these must be clubbed to death, some taking up to 5 hits, and then walked over. Some other enemies are indestructible, with the monkeys who throw coconuts at you particularly fiendish.

You will have to complete the level within the time limit, and avoid contact with these foes. However, bombs and improved weapons can be collected, as can extra lives, time bonuses and an improved jump.

You start off managing a team in the Conference (the fifth tier of English football) and aim to progress up the leagues, either by improving your existing team or earning jobs at better clubs elsewhere.

The features at your disposal include selecting training regimes, planning tactics for each match based on your opposition's strengths and weaknesses, scouting for new players including youth prospects, and arranging sponsorship and stadium improvements (so as to attract more fans).

The transfer system is a crucial part of the game, as you aim to sign players (who are broadly rated in each of the main skill areas) up against other teams who want them, and sell off players you don't need. You have an overdraft available, but make sure not to exceed it.

The game supports up to 4 players, whose matches all take place at the same time. You can make tactical changes and substitutions mid-match.

You started off managing one of the teams in the Conference, and had to try to reach the Premier league and win European competitions, either by improving your current club or by doing well enough to earn job offers elsewhere.

For each match you had to select the team, and choose a formation and a set of match tactics - intensity of tackling, height and length of passes, and shooting range could all be varied. In total there were almost 500 permutations of these options, as well as 18 basic formations.

You could sign players from other clubs, which involved making a financial offer to both club and payer and hoping that no other club offered more. Players who's contracts had expired could be signed for no club fee - so make sure all your players are under contract.

You also had to negotiate sponsorship deals, plan ground improvements, ensure that injured players got the right treatment, set up training schedules, and hire backroom staff (such as coaches and scouts).

    <resource id="651cf2bbfa526b67ba6e911d17121db8594f96f6" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Primal Rage is a versus fighting game developed and released by Atari Games to arcades in 1994. The game takes place in a post-apocalyptic version of Earth called &amp;quot;Urth&amp;quot;. Players control one of seven large beasts that battle each other to determine the fate of the planet. Matches feature many of the conventions of fighting games from the era, including special moves and gory finishing maneuvers.

Various ports were released for home consoles and personal computers. Efforts to perfectly emulate the arcade original have been unsuccessful due to an unusual copy protection method that the developers used.

Toys, comics, a novel and other merchandise tie-ins were produced.

A massive meteor strike has devastated the planet Earth. Human civilization comes to an end in the ensuing cataclysms, and humanity regressed into tribes of Stone Age dwellers. Primordial rainforest covers the land, and the continental landmass has shifted into the shape of a fire-breathing dinosaur skull. The planet is now primitively referred to as &amp;quot;Urth&amp;quot; by the survivors of the cataclysms.

Seven fearsome creatures emerge from their slumber deep within the Urth's crust, and become worshiped as gods by the humans, who form segregated clans beneath the ones they follow. The beasts themselves are divided between those who wish to keep peace on Urth, and those who attempt to plunge the world into further chaos for their own benefit. These creatures have otherworldly or supernatural abilities. The Primal Rage trading cards that were distributed along with the toyline presented each creature as a god of an aspect of nature, as in life and death, fire and ice. There are four of the good Virtuous gods and three evil Destructive gods. The character Sauron, god of Hunger, is marked as a &amp;quot;Virtuous Beast&amp;quot; despite the fact that his in-game ending displays an image of him devouring humans.

Primal Rage is a traditional two-dimensional fighting game in which two players select characters to battle each other in one-on-one combat, or a single player finishes a campaign of fights against the CPU, over increasing difficulty. The final battle of the single-player game consisted of fighting all the other CPU monsters with an increased power bar, made available in a mini-game prior to the fight. A total of seven characters are available for players to select from. Each character has his or her own specialized set of three attack moves and abilities. In the game, the object is to deplete the opposing character's health meter as fast as possible. If &amp;quot;Game Gore&amp;quot; (an option in some versions) is switched on, then a defeated character's heart will explode into a bloody mess, and their brain will dissolve to ashes.

While fighting, human tribesmen will wander nearby and worship their gods during battle. This allows for the creatures to toss them around or devour some to regain strength (eating opponents' worshipers will add a bonus to one's score, while eating one's own will penalize the player). Prior to the final battle, a mini game commences in which one is required to eat as many worshipers as possible to increase health for the endurance round. Two human-controlled characters can trigger an easter egg of human volleyball, by keeping worshipers off the ground and batting them back and forth.

Unlike most fighting games, where the special moves are performed by moving the joystick followed by pressing one or more buttons, Primal Rage features a system where the player holds down certain buttons, then performs the joystick movements. Later revisions of the arcade game added the ability to perform &amp;quot;special moves&amp;quot; in the more traditional way, with motion followed by button presses, but kept the original method as well. After the opponent is defeated, a brief moment is allowed for the player to perform a finishing move to end the match in a more dramatic fashion; these were performed in a similar manner to the special moves. Although all characters feature three finishing moves, some of them were more easter eggs than fatalities, such as Vertigo's &amp;quot;La Vache Qui Rit&amp;quot; (French for &amp;quot;the laughing cow&amp;quot;), a fatality in which Vertigo transforms her opponent into a cow, which moos and runs away.</resource>

There are twelve riders and five bikes (with different top speeds, acceleration and handling) to choose from. The full championship includes 12 races against a field of seven riders (computer opponents are loosely named after real riders of the day – Rain Wayney and Lucie Kavanora for example). 

Circuits are set around the world, with various weather effects, with a rendition of each national anthem played on the pre-race screen. Handling is loose and arcadey. It is not possible to fall off – contact with hazards or other bikes simply results in you losing time.

Your boat is fitted with bombs, which can be placed so as to force the other boats to run over them, gaining you points. Extra bombs and fuel litter the course, often close to the banks, which you must avoid contact with, for fear of crashing your boat. When this happens you are forced into the next one, which is, as if by magic, available at a convenient point just beforehand. A helicopter flies overhead, dropping bombs which you must avoid, and often obscuring your view. The other boats often crowd together attempting to force you into the wall.

As with all the Codemasters budget titles, realism goes out of the window, with an emphasis on simple instantaneous action.

    <resource id="69102d6c17a54bd5f5a0dc87c3a300ebd284d45a" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Profezia is set sometime during the Middle Ages, in a mountain area between the two Italian regions of Abruzzo and Lazio. The player takes control of a mercenary who has been hired to retrieve a golden crown from the castle of Capistrello, where Duke Attilio intends to use it on an ancient Pagan rite.

Profezia is an adventure game with a multiple-choice interface: as opposed to classic adventures where the player is free to roam around the game world (or part of it), the storyline in Profezia develops automatically. Whenever an action is to be taken, the player is presented with a set of choices, which will affect the rest of the adventure.

It is worth noting that there is no unique path to complete the game: the player may follow alternate branches, provided that the actions which follow are coherent with their previous choices.

These give off blue power-up tokens, which are used towards selecting one of many weapons. There are 4 front-firing options (guns, plasma, magma and laser-beams - guns can be built up quickly but lack top-end power compared to the others) as well as speed-up (only requires one token), side-shot, up to 3 homing missiles, build (a quick super-destructive blast that only functions when you aren't using auto-fire) and stealth (a period of invulnerability).

Each level has a very different setting, and an end-of-level boss to defeat. The chance to resume from the level you died at is offered up to level 3.

Unusually, the game has an option to emulate an auto-fire function using software (this makes it one of the few Amiga shoot 'em ups you can hope to get as far through on an emulator on keyboard as on joystick on the real thing).

A land full of good and evil, within which you must become Brian, The Viking Child, whose heroics have been foretold by the prophets and recorded in the oracle of the gods. But there's trouble in the land that you live in... Your family and friends are being held on the astral plane, imprisoned by the forces of darkness in an effort to foil the prophecy and install chaos throughout the land...

As Brian, your adventure in Prophecy 1 - The Viking Child will take you through many beautiful, but dangerous places, where you'll encounter great adversaries. Amongst these will be the eight apprentices of evil, slaves to the Dark Lord Loki, who will force you to fight or question your purpose under threat of punishment or penalty. Friendly shopkeepers will sell you items of worth, that will aid you on your quest. There are sixteen levels, each with its own backgrounds, enemies, and items. There are even puzzle elements similar to Bitmap Brothers' classic Gods. Overall, a great platform/puzzle hybrid that should please all fans of the genre, not least because of the long levels you'll have to make your way through. Recommended!</resource>

An alien race is threatening to take over 38 planets and you've got to stop them. 

Starting from Anacreon, you will mentally pass through the Krypton, Kalgan, Zorgon, Terminus, Trantor, and finally Sol systems. Each stellar system has a certain number of planets, which you will traverse from one to another. 

The game is a first-person virtual reality race, where you run as fast as possible on the tiles that are formed in a pentagonal prism. At the starting point you accelerate, and then change the facets of the prism in order to avoid falling through the gaps. When the tile's path  spirals, you may decelerate your velocity. Time runs out, and you must refill your time meter by standing on tiles marked with a &amp;quot;T&amp;quot;. Standing on certain tiles that are marked with shapes of different blinking colors will give you a different amount of points. Special actions, such as jumping from one part of prism to another as well as teleporting forward and back, may be performed. Save points are placed on the track but the number of prism facets may change during your run.

Finishing the race to each planet will give you a password, which may be used later to start from this point. The best scores will be written in High Scores table.

The game is available for 1 or 2 players.

Taking control of one or the other (Puffy is more powerful but Puffyn can move faster) you must find your way through.

Puffy's Saga is an overhead view maze game that represents a cutesy variant of Gauntlet. Each of the 20 levels has a quota of dots to eat before the level is completed. These levels are inhabited by foes who surround you and reduce your energy on contact. Meat restores 100 energy points each time - this total can go beyond its starting level of 500. You are armed with a gun, which not only kills foes but also turns many of them into edible energy-giving snacks.

Keys must be collected and used to open doors. Magic Goms allow you to use a map or a fire-bolt. Other available bonuses include invincibility periods and teleporting.

    <resource id="c965a827c2cee150e51dc411b254177ea539425c" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">You're playing a small ant that is willing to help a friend in rather inconvenient situation. Apparently, your friend, doggie, likes to eat cookies that has his picture on their box, and he got himself so carried away that he lost the balance, and a bag of cookies fell deep down into an ant-hill. Now, you're goin' in, in a mission of solving puzzles, and retrieving the cookies for your friend.

Now, this ant-hill is a bit different from the ones you saw, and especially from the one you live in. It's path is filled up with boulders, and all the gates, and you must travel the quest to find the cookies. After each different place inside, you'll fins a small bag of cookie, and bring it back to your friend doggie.

The main quest consists of you carrying your-size boulders, and placing them in a well imagined line, so when you push the exact one, all must fall, and the one that marks the end must fall the last, or the door will stay shut permanently. Beside we know that ants are very easy, and can live almost every fall, you cannot practice that, so if you jusp from a little bit too high position, don't expect much, but to retry the level.

Every block, or boulder in a game has a different markings. Like for example, the yellow ones are bricks you can push, and they will just as easily fall, and push, or not, the brick in front of it. The red ones will do the opposite, you cannot push them, and if the yellow, or any other brick hits it, it'll continue falling back to the other side. Some bricks explode when you push them, or other brick hits them, and that way they leave the hole, so your brick can continue spining, or yet again, not. Some spin without stop, 'til they hit some other brick that can fall, some replaces the spaces, like building a bridge on that place, some go high and when hit the top, they stick to it, and push, or not, the brick in front of them. Anyway, that's the game basics.

Each level gives you the new code/password, so you can continue from the position where you ended each time you type that code. Perspective of your ant is like in any other platform game, and you control it with arrow keys, or joystick. But beware, the time is clicking, so you'll have to solve each level in a hurry.</resource>

    <resource id="d85e2f875cd8a64a18b58e9fef4419c2a82ac2b5" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">The challenge in each level of Puzznic is to maneuvre a selection of blocks into place so as to clear them all, by making them make contact with blocks of the same design. You control a cross-hair, which can move a block left or right, which can cause it to fall if there is no block under the space it would occupy.

There are many complications in terms of solving the levels. Moving platforms meaning that you need to move a block at a particular time, or in particular order, to prevent them being blockaded. In some situations there are an odd number of a certain type of block - solving these requires positioning two of the blocks one space apart, such that a move will result in a piece making contact with 2 others, and immediately removing all 3. You will also encounter blocks positioned on platforms suspended in space and gaps in level arrangements meaning that a certain number of blocks must be in place to make a certain move possible (by forming a stack, for example)

The game structure is slightly unusual, as after you complete each batch of four levels you get a choice of 2 sets of levels - you are progressing through an expanding matrix of levels, which means there are 2 sets on level 2, 3 on level 3, 4 on level 4, and so on. This means that there are a total of 220 screens in the game. Each screen is played against a time limit, and losing a level (either by running out of time, or by making a poor move and leaving an impossible position) loses one of your 3 lives.

Fuzzball (AKA Q*Bert) and has been written by Ronald Weeserik. Ronald's no stranger to writing classic games on the Amiga and a few of his smashes are Silkworm, SWIV and Rodland.

The idea is to guide a blobby little sprite around a three dimensional pyramid by hopping from square to square and lighting up all the cubes in the structure. It all sounds very simple, but Ronald has included some devious nasties to compete with your sprite. Bubbles roll down the pyramid from top to bottom, whilst other similarly-shaped creatures may roll down and move from side to side.

Amazingly, Weeserik has chosen to release Q-bic onto the bulletin board circuit, and is not hoping to make any money out of the venture. Game is released as a Coverdisk on CU Amiga disk 41.</resource>

Drawing the rectangles using the &amp;quot;slow&amp;quot; method awards you the most points. Once a rectangle has been made, it will be colored in to show that you have claimed your territory. While drawing the rectangles, you need to watch out for Qix (pronounced &amp;quot;kicks&amp;quot;), a series of colored lines that crawl the screen. In addition to Qix, you also need to avoid the Sparks who travel around the border, as well as any lines that you have made, as well as The Fuse, who travels along the line that you are drawing. Once you have claimed enough territory, you proceed to the next level.

At the beginning of a game, you can select the desired image or layout, as well as whether you wish to play with unlimited time or not. You can also select the &amp;quot;Imposed&amp;quot; game mode, in which the game points which piece you must fill next. Each layout has a set amount of paint available for use, in four different colors: red, green, blue and yellow. The amount of brush stokes left for each color is indicated on your palette. Some layouts have a large amount of a particular color and a very small amount of another, while other layouts have a more even amount of each color. The goal is to plan well from the start, so as to avoid running out of a particular color that will be needed to finish the layout.

The game can be played in solitaire mode, against the computer, or against another human player on the same screen. There are no sound effects during gameplay, only music. If you manage to finish a layout, you can enter your name in a high score table.

The even-numbered waves scroll in a single direction, but include waves coming at you from other directions, even from within the screen in 3D. You can have up to 3 power-ups stored on your ship at a time, and choose one to activate by pressing F1-F3 - they all have limited firepower. Unusually, when you have no lives left, death results not in game over, but the loss of one of your power-ups (chosen by you).

Directly following from the events of the first game, the newly-proclaimed Hero of Spielburg travels by flying carpet with his friends Abdulla Doo, Shameen and Shema to the desert city of Shapeir. The city is threatened by magical elementals, while the Emir Arus al-Din of Shapier's sister city Raseir is missing and his city fallen under tyranny.

After defeating the four elementals that threaten Shapeir, the Hero travels to the city of Raseir. There, he is imprisoned by Khaveen and under hypnosis helps the evil tyrannous wizard Ad Avis to resurrect the evil genie Iblis. In the final fight, the Hero attacks the palace and battles with Ad Avis, who falls to his presumed death begging for assistance from his Dark Master. As thanks for the Hero's success in liberating Raseir and restoring its lost splendor, the Sultan of Shapeir, Harun al-Rashid, rewards the Hero by adopting him as his son.</resource>

You start out as a lowly peasant with only a few gold coins in your pocket and a bad attitude to defend yourself. By stumbling around the countryside and fighting hordes of creatures, you gain wealth, experience, and title.

Questron II spans two continents, Landor and the Realm of Sorcerers. Additionally, there are the requisite tombs, castles, and dungeons. In the first Questron, your goal was to defeat the evil Wizard Mantor. Now, in Questron II, the good Wizard Mesron has sent you back in time before the Book of Magic was created. Your goal is to defeat the six Mad Sorcerers before they can create the book.

This can be achieved by getting all the fruit and gems in the level, or killing off enemies. There are 80 levels to complete and once you complete all of them, the levels are repeated. 

You exit each level by collecting all the gold keys then entering through the door that opens. You have a certain amount of time to complete the level before spikes fall down the level. There are eight areas, all consisting of ten levels. At the end of each area, there is a guardian waiting for you, and again, you have a certain amount of time to defeat them.

You kill enemies by throwing orange-colored eggs at them, and in the earlier levels, they go down in one or two shots, but in later levels, you'll find out that all of them take more than two shots to bring down, so your orange balls would be useless here. The solution is to get a special power-up that will give you chocolate eggs.

Besides gold keys, you can also collect silver keys. This lets you unlock a gate, giving you access to more shots or power-ups. There are also booby traps in the level, such as spikes, and some parts of a level are blocked off by spikes. Get a mushroom and they turn into flowers that you can pick up. Beware, getting another mushroom will make them turn into spikes again. 

Apart from the normal levels, there are challenges where you have to complete a level and get all the fruit as you can under a 20-second time limit. Depending on gameplay, there are  also tricks where the last key you have to get flies away and you have to catch it. Other tricks include turning on the lights to see enemies, and running away from the &amp;quot;happy ghost&amp;quot;. You'll receive bonus points at the end of the level if you manage to collect every gem in the level.

Qwak can be played as either a one or two player game. The game was released at budget price, and later on a CD double pack with Alien Breed '92.

Baseball 2 features all 26 major league teams, each with a full roster of players. You can choose any National or American League team. You can even play one of the 1989 All-Star squads.

R.B.I. Baseball 2 has One Player and Two Player options as well as a Password mode to enable you to play a full season (one game against every team in the division). In addition, a watch mode provides you with the best seat in the house for a computer-controlled match up.

R.B.I. Baseball 2 is similar to the original R.B.I. Baseball in terms of gameplay. This time around the game uses the teams and statistics from the 1989 season. Just as in the original, you get to see what it's like to step up to the plate as Ricky Henderson, pitch the ball like Nolan Ryan, and catch a line drive like Ozzie Smith.

Initially you race at Clubman level on fictitious local tracks (one of which is set in MicroProse's old UK home of Tetbury), before moving up to UK and then World championship racing if you're good enough.

Each class of racing has 8 computer opponents, with the top 7 finishers in each of the championship's 8 races scoring points, and the races can be set to 5,10, 15 or 20 laps. The game's graphics appear to feature sprite-based bikes atop polygon scenery, which makes for very fast gameplay. 

The circuits feature puddles of water to upset the bike's handling, and oil, which causes you to crash. It takes time to remount the bike and get back up to speed by revving it back up (more realistic than most motorbike games at the time, but frustrating as you suffer for mistakes more), and after a couple of crashes the bike's dashboard fails, making it much harder to ride competitively.

There is a two-player null-modem link-up mode, which can support an ST racing against an Amiga if you have the right cable.

    <resource id="5006f4b849705049a53473185445efed65fc69ad" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">The fact is that Raider is that old 64 budget classic Thrust with a bit more colour and a few more levels. After plunging into the game, it's made clear that you have to shoot out all the fortifications and pick up a cog-like pod on each of the four star systems and then fly through a powerplant to deposit them. This boils down to a great deal of fiddly frustration as you try to negotiate flak and rock outcrops whilst battling with gravitational pull from the planet.

Thrust Raider is controlled from the keyboard, something of an anachronism in this day and age for a game methinks, especially when the mouse could have done the job equally well. The sound effects do not help, whilst the graphics look, as someone put it 'as if they were knocked up on D Paint in ten minutes'. It's not that Raider has no appeal, the original gameplay can still hold your attention for a while, and it's fiendishly difficult too.</resource>

But in 4x4 mode path marks may stop the car, while in 4x2 mode the car may knock the path parks off. Switching the gear, player may drive back and forth to avoid blocking of car either by path mark or by debris in the sand. Direction of the way is shown by compass as well as length of traversed path and volume of residuary fuel are displayed by indicators.

Other drivers are present on the way during day and night, therefore they should be left behind to win in the rally. There are five stages with different visible horizons:
1) Tunis - In Salah (5726 Km); 
2) Ouallene - Achegour (4353 Km); 
3) Achegour - Niamey (4587 Km); 
4) Ouagadougou - Bamako  (4438 Km); 
5) Bamako - Dakar (3622 Km).

So, you have to conquer the sands of Sahara, show good time on each stage, and to be the first at the finish.

Choose from 4 scenarios across two continents with randomly generated resources, and design your own railroad that moves people and goods across the country. Use the revenue to continue expanding, while keeping control of your company and appeasing your stock holders with growth and revenues. Play the stock market with company assets. Drive your competitors out of business with buyouts and rate wars. Multiple types of resources to carry (roughly grouped as slow freight, fast freight, passengers, mail) and convert, own facilities to maximize profit (buy a steel mill and the conversion from iron ore to steel makes money for YOU). Use the latest available technology to your advantage (new locomotives). Your objective is to retire with a huge bonus (based on your company's assets) and become the President or the Prime Minister (depending on which continent). 

The game is essentially a bird's-eye-view real-time strategy game with aspects of building and stock market manipulation. Each fiscal period is 2-years, which corresponds to 1-day of track time. Build different sizes of stations to take care of different local needs, create trains that switch consists at different stations and maximize throughput. Upgrade/retire/modify trains as times change. The faster the trains arrive, the more money they earn. Multiple options will keep you busy as each game is different.</resource>

By trapping beasts under your rainbows, then jumping on them to break them you can collect seven different colored gems, and there are also power-ups for extra speed and rainbows.

Rally Cross Challenge sees Anco bring it to life in top-view Super Sprint style.

There are six different circuits, and four cars in the game - 16-bit users with a Microdeal joystick adapter can have all four of these controlled by human players, other users are limited to 2-player. Computer cars have varying personalities and abilities. You must finish in the top 3 to move on to the next race.

The opportunity to upgrade your car comes after each race, with the points you earn from race results (4,2,1 for the top 3). There are six categories of upgrades - turbo, steering, traction, aerodynamics, repair time and brakes.

Following this, the three of them plan to go round destroying buildings, and up to 3 human players can join in.

Smashing at the edges of the buildings for long enough will make them collapse. The police and military are after you, and will shoot at you, so try to destroy them (failing that, you can avoid the bullets). You will need to eat regularly, with things like plants on offer, to avoid shrinking back to being human

This is done by first shooting the ghosts using a gun, and then by using a photon beam (by holding down the fire button) to suck them in for storage in the backpack. Photon recharges can be collected, as can the potential for an improved shot, as well as a shield. The Ghostbusters mascot Slimer also appears as a power-up, which hovers around your character killing ghosts on contact.

    <resource id="8072197d5ccc7e80f246e81dfef56a8d29180ea7" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">The first game in the Realms of Arkania trilogy was the Blade of Destiny. It combines all the best characteristics of that times RPG's, like an extensive story line, first person view mode, cave exploring, scenery and freedom over your own actions. This game was an immediate hit when it was first released, forcing the producers to make a new English version almost over night! This delayed the sequel to the game, Star Trail, for a whole year.



The game is incredibly huge for the time it was made. A lot of work was put into creating the world, including history, geography, folklore, races and NPC's. The story is epic, as all RPG's... You play the role of six different people; all looking for adventure and fame that arrives in the city of Thorwal. After a while, you are sent to the real quest of the game: hunt for the sword of legendary warlord Hetman Hyggelik. In order to find it, you will have to travel the world in search for pieces of a map, drawn by one of Hyggelik's warriors. This map, naturally, shows the location of the sword.



The game is good, and a nice way to start off the trilogy. Have fun!</resource>

In each of the game's single screen levels the player's task is to save a number of humans that have been captured by robots. The player enters each level from a drop ship and has to rescue the humans by simple moving up to them and touching them and then leading them back to the drop ship. At the same time numerous robots have to be destroyed but while doing so it's important to avoid killing the humans by mistake.

Each level has its own quota of humans that have to be saved and it has to be done within a time limit. There are numerous different robots with differences in pace, armour and weapons. Some power ups can be picked up such as shields, extra lives, invisibility and various new weaponry like rockets. At some locations there are fences that have to be destroyed and doors that have to be unlocked. There are also trap doors that have to be avoided.</resource>

    <resource id="006b3b5fa8713234c8ccbe451e3d66d8e4174cbe" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Red Heat is based on the Walter Hill film of the same name, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger and James Belushi. You take control of Soviet detective Ivan Danko (played by Schwarzenegger), who travels to Chicago in pursuit of the fearsome Georgian drug lord Victor Rosta. 

The game is essentially a side-scrolling beat'em up in the vein of Vigilante. As Danko, you proceed across four levels which follow the movie's original setting, where you are constantly attacked by members of the Cleanheads, a group of drug-dealers who are in business with Victor Rosta. To eliminate hostiles you can either punch them (slow but long-ranged) or head-butt them (close-ranged but faster). The only defensive move available is crouching, so as to avoid being hit - there is no jumping or any other evasive tactics. Occasionally, you can get hold of a handgun and fire six shots at the villains. Other items you can pick up will boost your health, grant you access to bonus levels, or cause you to lose control of Danko for a few seconds.

One peculiarity of Red Heat is its widescreen-like game area, and the fact that all characters are drawn from the waist up. This may find partial explanation in the first level, set in a Russian sauna where, as in the original movie scene, all characters are not wearing clothes.</resource>

And the only way NATO can prevent that from happening is to reinforce their forces with convoys from the US and other countries. 

You are in command of one of the US attack submarines. You must hold the ocean against the Soviet navy at all costs, or the land battle will go badly. Part submarine simulator, part dynamic campaign, and part WW3 simulation, Red Storm Rising is an amazing look at modern warfare.</resource>

The game is set on the mean streets of Brooklyn, which you must venture through to meet your girlfriend, and then rescue her from her kidnappers. This is split into five levels, taking you through the subway and the docks as well as some inhospitable streets. A wide range of aggressive moves are on offer, including headbutts, kicks, punches and flying kicks. Much of the game's violence is depicted in a fairly tongue-in-cheek style, with an element of attempted humour along the way.

Of course every bit of help is appreciated and so every scientist is cloned 50 times for a better productivity. Unfortunately the evil Mechanauts have invaded and the player has the mission to save the scientists and drive the Mechanauts off.

This game is a side-scrolling shooter in which the player's main task is to shoot everything in sight - except the scientists of course, which should be picked up. They also can be shot to win the level, but then the player misses out on extra weapons: every scientist (along with his/her clones) has his own piece of equipment which can be activated at any time as long as the scientist is on board. In contrast to many other games of the genre, contact with the environment does no harm but causes the ship to reverse the flying direction at full speed. All in all there are 50 levels with twelve scientists each.</resource>

Two research ships, designated Explorer-1 and Explorer-2, are outfitted with experimental drive and sent to find new planets of colonization. Only Explorer-2 returns back to Earth. Refiited as a colony vessel, Explorer-2 is once again ready to embark when peace is disrupted. At this same time, a planet-wide rebellion stages a coup and overthrows the government. The Explorer-2, crewed by a loyalist space crew barely escapes and leaves the solar system. Years later, the Explorer-2 arrives damaged at it's destination and a colony is set up, naming it New Earth. After many generations, the colony is self-sufficient enough to develop a mission: Explore nearby space, research new technologies, harvest resources, develop a space fleet and eventually... reconquer and reunify with the Earth.

Reunion is a strategy game where players must manage the resources and development of a colony. From a central command area, players select from among different menus to control different aspects of the colony. Many of these menus also need the appropriate personnel in charge (commanders), whose skills and price tag vary. Typical menus include: The research screen where specific areas are selected, the production/buy menu which turns resources into goods, the colony building menu where construction can be scheduled and the colony's facilities managed, the galactic map where new planets are chosen for a closer look, and eventually colonization. Players can also consult with their commanders or go to &amp;quot;space local&amp;quot;, the nearby bar for all the gossip. In order to produce new material, the player has six different minerals to mine and discover on various planets in the solar system.

Each of the 80-plus levels is a top-down view of an arrangement of locks and dials, which must be aligned so as to unlock each section by having identical colors touching each other. Not all locks can be moved however, and all of this must be done within a time-limit. Your time to collect the gold (by opening each of the 9 doors in sequence in the hope of finding lots of bling) is limited by how long you took to crack the code. There is a bonus game to unlock, as well as extra lives and special power-ups. A password system ensures that a level need only be cleared once.

The hordes of enemies to be taken on include falling umbrellas and drinks machines. Shot enemies release tokens ranging from points bonuses and energy recharges to control-reversers and poison.

Speaking of controls, the game uses the same system as Llamatron, which means that you fire automatically in the direction you're moving, but pressing the fire button allows you to rotate the direction of fire while immobile. This allows enemies in different parts of the screen to be attacked from less precarious positions.

However, his plane crashes in the middle of a bunch of crazed Coolus. Hopefully he's up to the challenge of escaping. If he is, he will find himself in the pyramid of Egypt with no easy way past leaders and their minions, and then engulfed in a web of traps in a Nazi base.

Rick Dangerous is a platform game across over 100 screens, in which Rick has his gun in one hand, and dynamite sticks in another. You must take a methodical approach to clearing each screen, as there are traps in place which will need memorizing and preempting where possible. Use the dynamite wisely, for enemies you can't get into the purely-horizontal range of your gun.

There are a fair selection of punches and tactics. The punches themselves are hardly textbook affairs, nor are they aesthetically executed, but they do seem able to bruise your opponent.

Game has better than average graphics and well defined sprites, but a boxing simulation stands or falls on the flexibility of its play. Standing next to someone and thumping them can get very boring. Ringside is reduced to a fairly static and visually unexciting game. Not even the absurd sequence between rounds where you have to wave a towel over your boxer by fiercely woggling the joystick can alter this.

Ringside can be a good laugh either in the one player or in the two player mode. Then again, no-one gets their nose broken.</resource>

William 'Blade' Hunter is a private detective who once was a police officer. He is asked to investigate a horrible murder of the mayor's daughter, whose body was mutilated. As Hunter begins to search for clues that would help him solve the crime, he uncovers a conspiracy involving a deadly drug and a powerful criminal syndicate behind it.

Rise of the Dragon is a futuristic first-person adventure game. The game's visuals are reminiscent of a comic book, with digitized photos of actors and hand-painted backgrounds. Unlike most other adventure games of the time, it relies less on inventory puzzles and more on specific choices made by the player. The game has an internal clock and requires the player to plan the protagonist's moves ahead in order to be in the right place at the right time. Dialogues with multiple choices are utilized as a gameplay tool; a wrong choice will often lead to a premature end of the adventure.

There are two side-scrolling action sequences in the game; both can be bypassed without penalty if the player character dies several times in a row. The Sega CD version does not allow the player to skip these sequences. In addition, it uses a different color palette with a greenish tint, and has voice-overs for the dialogues.</resource>

The goal is to reach the finish line in one piece throughout each of 50 levels. Numerous enemies are out on the road to try and stop you, including armored cars, motorcycles, canons on the side of the road, landmines, and more. 

Your vehicle is equipped with a machine gun to help you out, and occasionally a weapons plane will fly in and drop additional power ups that can be collected. Some of these are the U.Z. canon, cruise missiles, and speed boost. Your car has a very limited amount of fuel, however more can be picked up along the way by crossing the halfway point of a level, or by collecting the red and green fuel spheres that appear in the road or after destroying certain enemies.  On many levels collecting fuel is critical otherwise you won't be able to reach the finish line.

Starting at the back of the pack the objective is always to finish first on a linear course, overtaking the other bikers. This is achieved by driving very well or by playing it dirty, knocking opponents of their bikes using clubs, crowbars or your bare hands. The other racers fight back in a similar fashion and there are also hazards. All the races take place on the regular road with normal traffic and the cops, as well as occasional oil slicks and stray cows.

By winning races you can get promoted to a stronger division and earn cash with which you can buy a better bike. Whenever you're knocked off your bike or hit something you will have to run back to your bike and lose valuable time, plus your bike will suffer some damage.</resource>

    <resource id="8ec23063c3bf202067a72ece855dad92258b7861" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">In Road Wars you are set charging up a long hilly road, trying to make a road safe after a protection malfunction. Crucially, this involves shooting out the barriers at the side of the road (and avoiding falling into the gaps they create). You always play against another droid, who can be treated as friend or foe - pushing them into the gap at the side you've just created is a particularly neat trick, especially when playing a human opponent.

You are armed with a laser gun, which can be directed seperately from your main direction of motion. The roads include a range of hazards, including barriers and spikes, although bonus weaponry and a speed-up can be gained. Contact with these (or your opponent) will gradually drain your shields, and once these are gone you have little chance of surviving for long.

There are 9 computer opponents in each race, and you must finish in the top 3 every time. Rockets and homing missiles can be collected so as to shoot the rival cars out. The tracks feature inbuilt hazards and treacherous shortcuts

Money is a big factor in all of this - the higher you finish in a race, the more you get; it can be collected during the race; each car you destroy gives you more money than the previous one, as you go for the Jackpot and then the Super Jackpot.

    <resource id="7d53da2ed9184b457f7d951bbc8eaa4c7976c4d6" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">The awkwardly-titled Robbeary gives you the opportunity of raiding a 24-floor mega-store of its fruity contents. The game opens with the obligatory irrelevant parallax starfield backing the title screen. A short entertaining sample borrowed from a Pet Shop Boys intro is looped continually until you start the game. If you have read between the lines of the scenario you will not be surprised to hear that Robbeary is a traditional platform game. It would seem that this store is an enormous greengrocer's shop, for almost every bit of floor space is occupied by big juicy pieces of fruit. Collect them all from the current screen to get to the next.

Beartle is a very neatly drawn sprite, as are all the enemies. Everything is large and very colourful, no doubt designed with a younger player in mind, the graphics certainly impress. Sound effects during the game are suitably jolly, though it is a shame the title piece never gets anywhere.

Robbeary is definitely one of the better platform games around the Amiga at the moment (1988), and if you have a younger player in mind it would be an ideal choice.</resource>

Robin must rescue Maid Marion from the clutches of the Sheriff of Nottingham, collecting treasure along the way. Robin is armed with a bow and arrow with which to take out gargoyles, trolls and the like. The level designs are long and maze-like, with a need to collect keys and uncover secret passageways in order to find all sections of them, and the gold they contain. Many of the moving platforms are only activated by collecting a key for them from elsewhere.</resource>

To chart the stars and planets explorers named &amp;quot;Robinsons&amp;quot; are sent on scouting tours of duty. Most of the time the Robinsons sent away are individuals deemed dangerous to society and whose ships are sabotaged.

You play one of these Robinsons who gets stranded on a mysterious alien planet on which a telepathic woman is also stranded. As it turns out she knows a way to get off the planet, but she needs your help to escape.

Gameplay consists of first person roleplaying with the emphasis placed on character modeling and survival. Take a dip when it's cold and you'll sure catch the flu, don't treat an infected injury and amputation is on the way, etc. You must fashion your own tools from whatever you can find on the planet and the game uses pre-rendered sprites over voxel technology terrain for graphics.

The major corporation there, Omni Consumer Products (OCP) saw an opportunity to sell a new kind of law enforcement officer to the troubled city. They took what was left of Murphy, encased it in titanium armor, wiped his memory and created RoboCop. Now it's up to RoboCop to clean the streets of Detroit and eliminate the one responsible for his murder, Clarence Boddicker. But it looks like Clarence might not be the kingpin of this town...

Based on the 1987 movie of the same name, RoboCop allows the player to control RoboCop. The majority of the game is a side scroller. RoboCop can punch unarmed citizens and shoot armed citizens. He can move left, right and duck but can not jump. Different weapons can be picked up from enemies, and power-ups to restore health and/or energy. Following levels, RoboCop will have to match a criminal's face to the proper mugshot and engage in a first-person shooting bonus round.

While the puzzle and shooting modes are very similar to those on the Atari ST, the main platform sections feature completely different level designs and separate gameplay mechanics.

All three of the platform stages present RoboCop with a set goal: destroying the Nuke drug lab, apprehending the criminal Cain and finally destroying Cain in his &amp;quot;RoboCop 2&amp;quot; form. On the way to the goals, RoboCop must defeat swarms of henchmen who attack him with guns, mortars and bazookas, and in the last level, various robotic enemies like flying drones and ED-209s. He can shoot back with a standard gun as well as pick up weapon power-ups in the form of cola cans: three-way shot, scatter shot and rapid fire, each with limited but ample ammunition. Other cans enhance the time limit of the level, replenish life energy or provide a temporary shield. Not every power-up should be picked up, however: some have negative effects like reducing the time limit or reversing the controls.</resource>

While it featured a succession of levels based around sections of the movie, these were highly varied and presented in polygon 3D graphics. These can be played in any order in the Arcade mode, or in planned sequence in the Movie Adventure mode, which follows the film's plot of Japanese investors wishing to replace Robocop with their Robot Ninja designs, and thus expecting him to prove himself as superior.

The first task is a car chase resembling Chase HQ, in which a mazey section of road must be followed efficiently. There are several first-person 3D shooing sections,. in which you must use a target to shoot down punks and invaders, without harming civilians. Robocop also takes to the skies in a simulation of his new Gyropack flying device. Also, he must do battle with his intended replacement in a fixed-perspective beat 'em up section.

Now there's nothing inherently wrong with the multiple-subgames style, but each of the three mini games is as thin and dull as the ones found here.

Everyone here has found the platform sequence tedious within 30 seconds, the middle game is simply atrocious, and the last section, a fairly presentable R-Typeish blaster, is unlikely to be reached by anyone other than the most bloody-minded, making it a bit of a waste of time.

The bottom line: excellent in-game music, but a tired, uneventful and repetitive game that more or less completely fails to provide any decent entertainment whatsoever after the neat front end sequence.</resource>

The game screen is laid out much like a Jeopardy board and players take turns at clicking on a square to reveal a multiple choice question. Get it right and you gain points, get it wrong and it's the next players turn. The game ends when at least 3 of the 4 questions in each category have been answered correctly. The questions revolve around Rock music and cover the 1950's-1980's. He who finishes with the most points wins.</resource>

You must choose from 1-4 rock stars (with names such as Tina Turnoff and Wacko Jacko) to manage by viewing their audition tapes. Once you chosen your artists you then have to choose what kind of gear to get them - spanking new, second hand or dodgy. The dodgy gear is dirt cheap but you might pay for your choice later on in the game.

To make your group a star, you have options such as practicing, publicity stunts, and buying gifts for your stars. Each action you choose advances the calendar by one day and you have until December to achieve your ultimate aim of superstardom - represented by a line graph which rises or falls depending on the performance of your band's releases.

Once your band has recorded their first album you can choose to release the single and/or the album. The single needs a video to go with it which costs varying amounts of cash depending on which director you choose. You can choose to go for publicity, but this can be risky as there is a chance that one of your rock stars will be in the papers as an ex-rock star who died in any of many strange ways (all that's missing is a 'bizarre gardening accident'). Publicity affects your sales directly and also affects the crowds who attend your gigs. You lose the game if either you run out of money, or all of your rock stars die.

However, in the 21st Century time travel has been mastered, as have jet-propulsion backpacks, plus some cataclysmic weaponry and advanced code-breaking equipment. Thus, you are sent back in time to change the result of the war using this technology to find their five rocket factories and destroy the moon base.

The game fits the Cinemaware template closely, with a string of action sequences linked by cinematic animation sequences to set the scene. There's also a strategic element, as you move your spies around to gain information and avoid detection, and decide how much Lunarium to use at each stage of the game. Action sequences include hand-to-hand combat with a Nazi guard, and flying through the air shooting either hordes of enemy planes or the Zeppelin itself.</resource>

There are 40 screens to clear, all full of baddies, who are disposed of by grabbing them with a stick, and flipping them from side to side to inflict damage. The hits needn't all be inflicted at the same time, as it's possible to release them to move them out of the way.

When killed, each bad guy releases some kind of extra, ranging from points bonuses to various devices which can be used to kill other enemies.

Each level also contains a certain amount of fruit. If you can collect all of this (with some bad guys still alive - you move on immediately once they're gone) you enter a bonus game, in which each enemy's death results in one of the letters E,X,T,R and A being released - collect them all for an invaluable extra life.

In the Game Boy version the difficulty lies slightly lower because the player can use his wand even when climbing ladders.

It was first released as a test application for UNIX, and quickly captured the imagination of popularity among system administrators and computer science students. It was such a popular Ã¢â‚¬Å“testÃ¢â‚¬Â that enterprising UNIX admins and users distributed it, expanded it, imitated it, and ported it to their home computers.

What is so special about the game that it still attract gamers for over a decade? Many revolutionary features that have become the norm in today's RPGs. Rogue is an  turn-based, single player dungeon crawl. Its attraction lies neither in plot nor puzzles, but in the seemingly endless combinations of features, a wide variety of monsters and loot, and randomly generated dungeon that guarantees infinite replayability. In short, Rogue is to RPGs what Crowther's mainframe Adventure is to adventures: a revolutionary game that spawned a genre.</resource>

    <resource id="1ad4ce6fb8fd58327cecd164d0e0f5313e155484" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Roketz is a 360 degree scrolling shooter featuring gravity environment and thrust-and-turn gameplay similar to the likes of Thrust, Virus, and SubSpace. Just like the latter, Roketz is an excellent multiplayer game. The fast paced dogfights guaranteed high levels of adrenaline for countless hours. The game boasts very nice ray-traced graphics and a wide variety of weapons to choose from.

Each battleground has different obstacles: gun turrets, pulsating force fields, etc. And of course, gravitational force constantly drags you down, so you will need both precise piloting skills and reflexes to succeed. The locations are nicely varied, although most of the action takes place in old production facilities rather than open space. Overall, if you enjoy classics like Thrust or Gravity Force, Roketz is well worth your time.</resource>

You are on board a roller coaster which has been layered with targets to shoot out. 

The roller coaster follows its natural path, swinging from side to side and up and down, while you aim a turret at the targets and shoot them out. After completing its cycle, the roller coaster reverses, moving through the same area moving backwards. A co-operative two player mode exists, in which each player controls a crosshair. Make sure to hang on as the ride turns.

You've never seen anything more than the provincial town you're in. You feel imprisoned, so logically, you will try to escape. That's your first mission, but it's a long way to Rome and in this game, you will see not all paths lead to Rome actually. Escape from that little town before the lava kills you and you will be saved... In the first mission, that is.

But actually, there's so much to say about this game, that I can only recommend playing it. Its graphics are very good for its time and the gameplay is pretty okay too. You have a lot of freedom to do whatever you like, but you are bound to some storyline restrictions, which makes this game fun and not too hard to play.

So it's definitely a game I would recommend, especially if you like to play freeplay adventure games. Anyway, try it and you will see for yourself.</resource>

    <resource id="32eae707fff7b28205691d85543ef9237cb68abc" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">You control a battle tank (the Rotor) which hovers in a 2D-labyrinth. Gravity pulls heavily on the Rotor, making it fall towards the ground. As any contact with walls or enemies is deadly, your main task is to avoid that. You may rotate your tank freely and accelerate via an afterburner, thus manoeuvring through the corridors -- imagine a mix of Asteroids and Lunar Lander to get an idea of the physics.

Scattered throughout the 18 different fortresses are boxes. Shoot these open to find either a) Fuel: this will replenish your supply, which is drained by shooting and accelerating. b) Sun crystals: Collect all to finish the mission. c) Bombs. They will explode in 30 to 60 seconds, destroying your ship. You can avoid that by leaving the screen quickly, or by picking the bomb up; this earns you major credits, but your ship drops much faster due to increased weight. d) Pearls. Collecting these advance the upgrade counter by one to three steps; you may activate the current upgrade at any time, which will improve your rotation speed, engine strength, weapon, shield etc. Boxes are emptied by carefully flying very, very close to them and activating a tractor field.

As if gravity and accurate flying wasn't challenging enough, the game also confronts you with various enemies. All of these are immobile and fire in a straight line; the sheer mass of them makes avoiding the bullets a difficult task nevertheless. Apart from turrets, there are attractors and repulsors who'll smash you into walls, and force fields that need to be deactivated by finding and shooting a switch.

The tricky labyrinths together with the short supply of fuel, weight constraints and clever upgrade system make Rotor more a game of tactics and accuracy than arcade action. Wild shooting and careless flying will deplete your fuel in no time; you'll have to progress carefully to discern traps in time.

Planning a path from sector to sector often involves using moving pathways. The sectors are heavily defended, but weapons can be picked up throughout. When a sector is cleared of robots, the screen flashes and the player is free to move on to the next sector.

I certainly wouldn't, especially as mad scientists cause so many computer game plot disasters) the Hanna Barbera characters have been hurtled into space. The Lilli-Punies have kidnapped them, and will only let them free if they can rescue their missing compatriots.

The search starts on the surface of the planet, but also takes Ruff underground into the cavernous regions the Lilli-Punies live in. These have lots of water, which Ruff must avoid. Plenty of extra lives can be collected along the way, with solving puzzles as important as good reactions and dexterity.

Runner, completing each course before time runs out.

There are also enemies on each course, such as cycles, indestructible armored drones, and flying bird-like craft. Shoot or avoid them. If you hit them, you lose one of your shields (your craft has six total) and are slowed down temporarily. The more shields you have at the finish line, the more bonus points you get. Getting hit with no shields does not kill you, however. There are no lives in this game. The only way to lose is to fail to cross the finish line.

Along the way you'll encounter Boost Pads that temporarily speed you up to incredible speeds and make you indestructible. By running over enough green stars on each course, you can also earn Shockwaves, which destroy all enemies in your path.

Note that there is no accelerator in this game. Your craft always goes full speed, unless you hit something. Then you will slow down, but quickly accelerate back to full speed. Other than that, you cannot slow down and the only way to speed up is to run over a Boost Pad. Your only controls are steering left and right and aiming the gun on top of your craft up and down.</resource>

    <resource id="8f5362ba36db87ac59fc29157ff66e8b7b2c03de" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Saint and Greavsie is a sports trivia game where one to four players have to answer sport-related questions. Players start by throwing a ball across a series of stadiums. To the left of these stadiums is a green bar, and the higher the green bar, the greater the distance the ball will go. 

Depending on where the ball lands, the player has to answer three types of questions from one of four question packs. Home questions (worth one point) are generally related to modern football and are the easiest to answer. Away questions (worth two points) are generally related to football in the 1960s and '70s with teasers about 'golden oldies'. Finally, derby questions (worth three points) will test your knowledge of football trivia, and these questions are fun as well as factual. Players can choose to answer the question or pass onto the next player. If the player chooses to answer a question correctly, a penalty shootout is given which involves the player kicking a goal to score bonus points.

The winner of the game is declared after all players have completed 21 or 42 matches (when one league season is completed). The winner is the player who has the most points.

The difficulty is that a tile can only be moved if it has no tile on top of it, and a gap either to the left or right (or both). Careful planning ahead is required if all tiles are to be cleared.

As with so many Dinamic games, the two parts are loaded separately, but the second can't be accessed until a password (provided at the end of part one) is input.

Contact with the enemies en route (which are mostly mutant demons) drains your limited energy, and you are also working against a time limit on each section. As well as your magical powers (which are stronger in part two), you can collect swords to attack, as well as lightning bolts which can be collected to destroy all enemies on screen. In part two vanquished foes release coins, which can be spent at shop sections on rechargers, shields and teleporters amongst other things.

People have assumed that you died as a result of your own mistakes. 

Now you have returned as a ghost, with psychic powers in place of your physical ones. Starting out at your own funeral, you must follow conversations to find clues. One early task is to find items which boost your physical abilities. You have help from other deceased beings, starting with pub owner Joe Danby.

Scapeghost was Level 9's final adventure game, and it is in the same format as the existing ones, which makes for a text parser with additional graphics. Puzzles require instructions to be given to other characters. The game is split into 3 days, each of which can be played independently of each other - November Graveyard, Haunted House and Poltergeist.

As his name suggests, Scrappy is adept at using his fists to vanquish many of these foes. The layout of the castle and the route to it features lots of ladders, ledges and gaps to negotiate. Bonus lives (via Scooby Snacks), invincibility periods and extra points (burgers) are on offer throughout the game. Many of these are in precariously-placed areas that require precise timing and considerable risk to reach.

Scrabble is a word game for 2 - 4 players. 
It is played by forming inter-locking words, cross-word style, on a Scrabble playing board. The Scrabble board is a grid on which there are bonus squares, playing a letter on one of these squares doubles or triples the score for either the letter or the entire word.
Players have seven letters, or tiles, each and at the end of each turn they take new letters from a pile, unseen, to replace the letters used. 

This game has the following features ;

1. multi-player game
 2, 3, or 4 players can play the game together. Players can be human or computer controlled.
2. sound effects and music
3. a practice mode
This mode of play enables the following features, 

1. no time limit,
4. a hint mode where the game shows the best move with the letters at the players disposal,
5. an advice feature which, after the player has taken their turn, shows how many higher scoring moves could have been made, 
6. the option to see what tiles remain unplayed,
7. a peek facility that allows the player to see other player's tiles
8. if an illegal word is played it will not be allowed but the player will not lose their turn,

a competition mode
In this mode each player has 25 minutes in which to play all of their game moves and for each minute over that limit the player is fined 10 points
The 'hint' and 'advice' features of the practice session are not available and the 'unused letters' option will show only the number of letters and not a full breakdown of the tiles remaining. If it is the players move ten the timer cannot be stopped, and the game cannot be saved and re-loaded.
Only game scores achieved in competition mode will be entered into the 'Top Scores' table.

This game is based on the Chambers English Dictionary and the Official Scrabble Words books current at the time of release

Every weapon has three upgrade levels. After that, you can decide how much ammunition for each weapon you want to load into your vehicle's weapon bays, switch between the tank and the chopper, choose one of the three special weapons and adjust the fuel/armor/speed characteristics. nnnnMissions are set in the desert and jungle as well as over the sea and in snowy regions. Most often your objectives are, obviously, to seek and destroy, while performing some rescue operations and gathering as much powerups as you can. The powerups consist of ammunition, fuel, medals, and others.</resource>

    <resource id="cf686d8317dfd77205844e094f9fcc4b794c3415" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Sensible Soccer is a soccer game similar to the Kick Off series. The graphical view is from a distance overhead, making the players small on screen, but allowing players to view around half the pitch.

The basic control system involves loose control, making running with the ball a skill to master, and putting the emphasis on one-touch passing, which can be easily performed by tapping the fire button.

The game features customisable league and cup competitions as well as pre-set ones including the 1992 European Championships. There are 168 teams in total, 40 European nations, the 64 top club sides, and 64 custom teams with names ranging from self-indulgent to comical, and their details are fully editable. At club and country level, each team has three star players who are more gifted that the others.</resource>

The Sentinel scans further round the landscape every few seconds - if you're caught in his gaze, or rather the square you are standing on can be seen, you'll have about 5 seconds to teleport to another location (or hit a key to teleport to a random location - which will never be higher, and may be lower than your current level) before the Sentinel begins absorbing your energy, when it reaches zero you will be destroyed. To travel a &amp;quot;robot hull&amp;quot; must be created on a visible square then teleported to, making sure you absorb your old hull to avoid losing energy. Boulders and trees can also be created, trees to block The Sentinels view and boulders can be stacked to gain higher ground.</resource>

As he arrives in his limousine, he soon discovers that the Dirk, the studio manager, has disappeared in Miami. Seymour must start production of his film by himself.

Seymour Goes To Hollywood is a platform adventure, another Dizzy clone, this time replacing the egg character with an amorphous blob of unknown origin. Like in the Dizzy games, the main objective is to collect everything that isn't nailed down (using the fire button) to solve puzzles. In the upper left portion of the screen sits an inventory with three slots and besides that the score points and the energy bar. Seymour loses energy when touching dangerous objects and hazardous environments. When the bar gets empty, Seymour transforms into a pile of bones and the player loses one life. The game starts with three lives (shown as clack boards under the energy bar) and no way of saving progress.

    <resource id="1cda5438dcc9b252ae1ecbbe5bece3eb4d545bd8" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Viewed isometrically, this role-playing game saw you leading a party of four intrepid souls on a mission to restore peace to the land. Sixteen levels awaited them, all filled with traps and monsters. Spells could be collected as the game went on, and multiple ones cast in quick succession. The characters could be split, and sent off on different routes and tasks to save time.

The game’s title was inspired by its innovative use of light, or rather of darkness. Nothing could be seen without the torches your characters had; these meant that vision faded outside their circular arc. You had to manoeuvre the torch around to reveal secret areas, and it could be used to ward off some monsters, although it alerted others to your presence.

Along the way you must solve puzzles, fight baddies and do masses and masses of exploring.

You have four characters to control in this real time RPG, and the designers have done their best to remove all the numbers usually involved in RPG's (dexterity/wisdom etc) and replaced them with friendlier looking graphical bars. Another good idea is the way you can put your characters in formation instead of having to move them one at a time. The other big innovative game system is the clever use of light: Teque's &amp;quot;Photoscaping&amp;quot; system which means you can only see a few feet in front of you and you can use flares and torches to light up areas.

The gameplay involves 144 tiles, each depicting different images, which have to be removed by matching them into pairs. The tiles are arranged in a gridded pattern, which is higher near the centre. A tile can only be removed if it has no tile next to it on at least one side.

This computer implementation can generate a random board layout to take on, as well as featuring 5 preset challenges, some of which have time limits of 5 or 10 minutes, as well as a multiplayer mode.

Once there, he must fight a succession of 11 opponents, one at a time, with gameplay resembling Street Fighter 2 or Mortal Kombat.

The game's graphics used similar rotoscoping techniques (similar to those used in Flashback or Prince of Persia) making Shaq's 7'2&amp;quot; frame is represented. As well as the story mode, the player can play individual fights, either with 1 or 2 players, although one human player must always be Shaq. Shaq can jump a huge distance, although he struggles to block.

The Germans have four different kinds of tanks, bunkers etc. Objectives include destroying bridges, capturing towns, rescuing jeeps and destroying convoys. You can drive one tank at a time and give the others movement orders on a map. They will automatically attack enemies they encounter. The map is also used for moving jeeps and calling artillery strikes. Your tanks can be repaired, refueled and rearmed if you capture hangers in some missions. Before each mission you can alter several realism options as well as the enemy moral, experience and commander.

Reaching the end of each level will find you battling it out with a boss. These range from 8ft giants to helicopter gunships.

There are several competitors, from which some of them definitely cheat, so be prepared to be laughed at. However, you can cheat as well, as you can resize your stick to fill the whole table width, or add one in the middle, and see who breaks glass first. There are single plays or the tournament where you play opponents in order of difficulty. The winner is the one who reaches 15 glassbreaks first.

The screen area moves across as you reach the edge of the screen and reveals a whole new range of enemies. These include lots of static turrets as well as cannon-fodder waves of enemies.

There are 6 levels and each level starts and ends with you travelling through a tunnel, and emerging on the other side faced with a new graphical setting, be it industrial, space or woodland. After clearing the last level the tunnel leads back to the first level, so there is no real ending to the game. There are no end bosses, instead each level ends with a more difficult part with a large ground structure and increased enemies and turrets. There are 3 difficulty levels to choose from, and a 2 player mode.

Interestingly, the game was not only released for Amiga and PC, but also as a coin-op  machine for arcades. The arcade version is identical to the Amiga version, the arcade PCB  even contains parts of the Amiga operating system.

Let's begin at the beginning. You can either play as a team in the official World Cup draw, or take part in a random one. Up to eight people can play at once, each selecting a team and playing through their respective groups until victory or rejection. Playing a game is incredibly easy, far easier than the Kick Offs and Sensible Soccers of this world. The reason being that there are none of the combinations and strange joystick positions of those games. Have no fear, as Sierra Soccer is just as addictive and just as much fun. Whether you have an A500 or an A1200, you'll be amazed at the spectacular animation of the players on the pitch. Over 4000 frames of animation have the players running, jumping, sliding, falling face down and there's even a fully mobile referee, complete with working whistle.

For a long while after Pearl Harbor, you are the only forces capable of striking back at the Japanese in the Pacific. Take one of the &amp;quot;fleet boats&amp;quot; and go on extended patrols of up to 2 months from Hawaii, Australia, or New Zealand. Set your difficulty/realism level and time period (early means less tech for juicier targets, later means tougher escorts, more tech, lousier targets). Contend with factors like dud torpedoes, maximum depth, and more. 

You can choose among practice run against some old hulks, recreate historical convoy attacks, go on a single patrol, or go on your own campaign, which lets you go multiple patrols until you die, get promoted, or survive the war. 

How well will you do when matched against history?

The US has suffered an attack at Pearl Harbor, and most of its battleships are lost. The few remaining US carriers are fighting a desperate war against the Japanese surface fleets. But the US has a secret weapon: sleek, silent, deadly... you are a Submarine Commander!

The action is viewed from within the submarine. Watch out for your speed, direction and depth. This game features 9 types of submarines to choose from, 10 types of torpedoes to fire, 14 Japanese surface ships (9 warships, 5 transport), and the entire Pacific Ocean as your battleground. The seven missions all recreate real US navy engagements. Can you sink the Yamato???

These had previously been released for some but not all of these systems.

Silicon Dreams can be played as three separate games, but to obtain the maximum number of points, you must complete them in order (carrying your score from one adventure to the next). Snowball has graphics for the first time, and the other two games have more graphics than before, and some longer text descriptions are added to all 3 games.

Snowball: As Kim Kimberley, your mission is to safeguard the colonization ship Snowball 9 and its passengers. When you are awakened prematurely from hibernation, you know something's wrong!

Return to Eden: Your objective is to get into the new city of Enoch, and stop the Eden robots from destroying Snowball 9.

Worm in Paradise: You have to find as much information about the city as possible, obtain money, and then become a member of the governing party of Eden.

The main difference between this game and many other side-scrolling shoot-em-ups is that you got to be on land as well as in the air.

Player 1 would play as a helicopter, but if a second player joined the game, they would play as a jeep. Both players would have to protect each other as well as themselves. After a certain number of kills, a &amp;quot;goose&amp;quot; helicopter would form on the screen. If the players managed to destroy it they would get a weapons powerup. This would go on throughout the entire game (a &amp;quot;goose&amp;quot; could appear even during the end of level baddie!).

SimAnt at heart is a simple game and doesn't have all the glittery action of adventure and action games but it is, after all, a simulation. What it does have is a great deal of integrity, intrigue and interaction and provides literally hours of immersive game play. The interface, as in most Maxis games, is intuitive and very easy to use. Graphics are what you might expect from an ant simulation, fairly simple in appearance but detailed enough to allow meaningful text, charts and graphs to enhance control. Sound effects are very well done and, in fact, can be toggled off if you don't like the sounds of ant carnage before breakfast.

SimAnt has an amazing amount of strategy involved in managing the survival skills. With a great interface and easy game control system, it's a breeze to play. Various modes offer depth of game play. Replay value depends on how much effort you want to put into managing a virtual ant colony.</resource>

The first task is to place essentials such as housing, transport links, schools, factories and shops. There are 50 types of these, allowing for homes of all standards and different types of businesses. Make sure to consider which sites are effective for which tasks. Some power sources pollute, others don't but are more expensive. Taxes must be raised to ensure an income, and then portions allocated to public services such as policing and roads. Earthquakes, floods and fires are all emergency situations that must be dealt to contain any damage.

Successful mayoring will cause the small village to grow into a town, then a city and finally a metropolis. As the city's size grows so do it's needs. Commercial buildings may suddenly find that they need an airport to expand trade, or housing may find itself changing rapidly as vast amounts of people come and leave.

The game also includes 8 pre-defined time-limited scenarios, with specific challenges and targets. The environment varies in each game (especially if you have the Terrain Editor add on), and this should affect your choices.

A whole planet lies beneath you, on which you can simply control everything: The nature, the species, cosmic catastrophes, everything you like.

Like any Sim-game, this one relies heavily on independent players, since there is no story or concrete goal. All you have to and can do is try to play as long as possible, and boy, are you lucky that 1000 years in the game are only 10 seconds in real-time ! The big drawback of this game is not the fact that the graphics are WAY sub-average (although the resolution is high res!) and that sound is almost non-existent. No, the biggest drawback, compared to Sim City or Sim Ants is that this game has no real appeal to anyone but science students, geologists and pseudo-intellectuals.

This game is for those who find Railroad Tycoon or Civilization way too amusing, for those who think that good graphics are something unwanted and distracting from the real core of a game, or for those who think that dropping Ã¢â‚¬Å“I played through Sim EarthÃ¢â‚¬Â will let them get all the chicks.</resource>

    <resource id="d015549c6000d389bf1790b9f446f60d3be965ff" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">The story is that the Caliph has been turned into a Falcon by his enemies. Now cue Sinbad the super hero with his mission to save the kingdom. Sinbad now assumes command of the armies and navy of Damaron. The answer to most questions can only be found beyond the shores of Damaron. Therefore, you set sail aboard your ship, the Sabarlus, with your loyal crew. Like the legends of Sinbad, you encounter many adventures as you navigate foreign seas in your search for truth. Not all adventures will occur at sea, and when on land you must guard your anchored ship when venturing out. Failure to do so could result in the seizure of ship by sea pirates. As in the legends of Sinbad you must defeat the dreaded Pteranoxos and the Cyclops. You must also find the Gypsy and follow her advice. If you're lucky, the Genie will aid you in your endeavour. And occasionally, you must cross swords with the Black Prince and others.</resource>

No more glimmer, no more warmth, not even the slightest spark. Only you, Skrull the Barbarian, the incredible bastard son of the unnatural love between the Sun Woman and the Shadow Man, can free the Light again. But the gloomy world of Darkness is full of dangers...

The game represents a Barbarian clone, where you should select the available icon to allow your protagonist seen in third-person side-scrolling view perform the action. Right and left mouse buttons clicks invoke opposite actions. For example, left mouse button click on 'Move Left' icon will move Skrull left, while right mouse button click will move him right. There are seven icons to use: Stop, Move, Run, Jump, Use Sword, Up, Down. Several items may be collected in three inventory slots to be used later. In particular, such item may be a key dropped from dead Dragon to unlock a certain door.

The environment is labyrinth of dark, damp, and dangerous caves with many obstacles such as gaps to be jumped over and many different enemies such as tarantulas, vampire bats, or dragons. The key to world of Light's salvation lies hidden somewhere here and should be found by you finally.

He ruined their bright pink land by removing the colour, and it was only after he died that they had the opportunity to clean the land up. Your job is to travel through the 99 continents and clean each one in sequence.

Skweek can move in each of the four compass directions, and is armed with a simple weapon, whose shots rebound around before they hit one of Pitark's minions, the Schnoreuls - contact with which is instantly fatal. Some squares contain arrows which force you in a particular direction, while there are also blockades to avoid. Bomb squares blow up surrounding squares but give you time to move away from them as they do this, while Shortcut squares allow you to move to another teleport-type square by pushing the joystick in its direction.

Different levels of ammunition and missile stock can be set, to make for a variety of gameplay options. After the game has been ran for 3 hours, a hidden 'paper plane' mode is added, alongside a roster of topline machines such as the F-16 and MiG-29.

Skyfox is complete with deflection shields, laser cannons, five guided and five heat-seeking missiles and a top speed of Mach IV.  The 15 scenarios can be played at 5 skill levels. You will have to fight tanks, enemy planes and the mothership.  Use the radar to locate enemy vehicles, and the long-range scanner to ensure that no wave reaches your base before you can take it out. Keep an eye on your shields, and on fuel levels - you can dock at the base to refuel.

The gameplay is fast, fun, and surprisingly varied. You will pilot a starfighter on a variety of missions, from locating lost artifacts to destroying the enemy. The enemy ships, Xenomorph fighters in particular, are a far cry from dummy ships of most early shooters: they will dodge your fire, gang up on you, and are deadly accurate with their attack.
Skyfox II also features some simulation and strategy elements, you can plan your attack, set a course on the overview map, and use autopilot mode. You also have to refuel once in a while, and this naturally puts you in a vulnerable position as enemy ships are always around.
Overall, Skyfox II is perfect for fans of space simulations who want some arcade fun, and arcade fans who want something a bit more complex than Space Invaders.</resource>

    <resource id="3e8e99dcaec27f21aced768a9f7edcf14bbb9a2d" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">The final Amiga pinball game released by 21st Century is handled by Liquid Dezign, consisting in part of members from the original Digital Illusions team that made Pinball Illusions. After the relative failure of Pinball Mania, the team banded together one last time to send off the Amiga properly. They don't disappoint here. Even print publications agree: SlamTilt was the last game to score higher than 90% in Amiga Power magazine, before they went out of publication.

Included in SlamTilt are four new tables designed from the start for AGA-capable Amigas, meaning the tables look as smooth as ever. The palettes used here are quite a bit darker, thematically, than others. Lots of navy blues, less saturated colors. And Liquid Dezign doesn't pull any punches as far as content, either: all of the tables have multiball modes, ball savers, kickback features, video modes, and more combo bonuses than you can swing a flipper at. (Terrible joke, yes.) The ball looks a lot nicer and actually appears to be rolling instead of simply being a tiny bitmap flying around the screen. Flashers and table lights will appear to illuminate everything else. The dot matrix display above the table is animated really smoothly and has all kinds of fun little videos that play for things like bumpers being hit, or losing your ball.</resource>

Sleeping Gods Lie though is an odd game. The puzzles are in there just waiting to be found and the game has considerable depth but to its detriment there is a heck of a lot of wandering around vast, barren terrain as well. The slow moving pace put me off initially but once I got down to some serious mapping it became quite a compelling adventure romp. The accompanying sound effects are surprisingly poor but the title screen music has a certain charm. Sprite expansion is well implemented but I found the character animation and movement occasionally a bit messy to look at. In short, a little long-winded but enjoyable all the same.</resource>

Ralph must bridge gaps, beat up baddies, stop Lee falling into water, inflate his own body and float above obstacles, and generally be a selfless version of man's best friend.

Between each of the major levels, there is a dream sequence where Ralph can collect various tokens and trigger what he &amp;quot;really&amp;quot; thinks should happen to Lee.

The are six huge parallax scrolling main levels and five bonus levels. There are several full motion video sequences setting the story.

There is also a special Amiga 1200 version which has enhanced full motion video and in game graphics.

You control a ball over a futuristic landscape, the idea being to find the puck that's hidden somewhere in the level and &amp;quot;herd&amp;quot; it back to your starting point. Sounds simple enough, except for one thing, there's another player (either computer or human) trying to do the same thing.

This results in incredibly hectic gameplay. Add this to the fact that sometimes you're negatively charged to the puck (and thus kick it away) or positively charged (so the puck sticks to you) and you're in for a crazy time!

In Slightly Magic you are cast as Slightly - mischievous nephew of legendary wizard Bigwiz, who has suddenly taken off on some urgent business, leaving his castle in disarray with dragons and magical spells running amok. One of the dragons kidnaps the princess, and now Slightly has to save her.

In addition to standard inventory puzzles of Dizzy games, Slightly Magic introduces a magic system that requires multiple objects to be combined in order to achieve effects ranging from frightening the enemies to turning the player into a fish.

The world's most popular television show is Smash T.V., an ultra-violent contest between two armed-to-the-teeth combatants, set loose in a series of deadly arenas that are filled to bursting with hordes of mindless beasts and killer robots. The aim of the game is to blast everything in sight and try to grab more cash and prizes than the other guy. Toaster ovens, VCRs, fancy cars and luxury holidays are there for the taking... for anyone who can survive long enough to enjoy them.

Smash T.V. is an insane shoot-em-up from the brain of Eugene Jarvis, creator of Robotron: 2084. It retains that game's frantic style of play and two-joystick control method, but adds plenty of gore, violence, a hint of satire and that all-important two player mode.

You've aircraft carrier missions like free flight, destroy enemy aircraft carriers, destroy drug ships and destroy enemy oil supplies. 
In the air you can fight the MiG-27, Su-27, MiG-29 and MiG-31 armed with heat or radar guided missiles!

You can choose to be an existing pilot or to create a new one. 
You can choose between 2 levels of difficulty: beginner (less enemy attacks) or expert (the most dangerous).
The weather will affect the mission. The good weather will be great for training, and the stormy will be dangerous but great for attacks, as you can hide into the clouds and approach the enemy unnoticed.
You'll have a copilot that will help you telling what's going on every moment. 
You can avoid missiles using your skills, using chaff or... if you can't, you can use your parachute!

    <resource id="e1fff00ef44b5d4fe8170895526f151bb6b72fa2" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Soccer Pinball is a pinball game with eight round split across three tables. On the soccer-themed levels, a 'goal' is guarded by 'defenders' who must be removed by hitting them. Score three goals to reach the next level - initially you will face another soccer-based table with more defenders. Other football-themed elements include 'throw-in' positions from the side and pop-up players to toggle for points. 

On the Amiga version, the later tables have a casino and gambling as a theme. Gameplay is fundamentally the same - hit the correct targets in sequence to advance, with other targets adding to your score.

The main bulk of the gameplay is a horizontally scrolling shoot ‘em up, putting you in control of Xain, who can jump or duck to avoid enemies and jump up to higher ledges. Lots of extra weaponry can be collected along the way, although this is lost when one of your five lives is lost.

The planets Lagto, Cleemans and Cleemalt are all available for selection immediately. These each have their own settings – Cleedos is desert, Cleemalt cavernous and Lagto lush and verdant. After completing each planet you must successfully fly to the next one.

Although released on the Atari ST, the Amiga version was previewed and reviewed in magazines but never appeared. The authors completed the Amiga version, but no longer have a copy of the source code or binary. However, a friend had still retained a working version.

The evil demon Taar-Ka has occupied the lovely kingdom of Tan Tao, which is why Son Shu-Shi is now allowed to act as a savior in the emergency. Technically very well balanced game, very colourful with beautiful background. The sound effects are clear and crisp and music is everywhere.

This is a brilliant platformer. Gameplay is no slouch and helps to make it thoroughly entertaining with fast and frantic playability. So beautiful and very addictive. Now I  need Ã¢â‚¬Å“one more goÃ¢â‚¬Â.</resource>

There is a boss at the end of each level which must be beaten in a time limit in order to progress. Most enemies are aircraft, but there are also tanks, trains, and turret installations to wipe out. Defeated waves of enemies reveal improved weaponry and other bonuses.

This platformer is the first game featuring the characters and they have got themselves into some problems. Matthew has gone out and left Sooty in charge of the house. Problem is that Sweep has left all his old bones all over the house and left the door to the garden open so that all kinds of bugs have gotten in.
 The game simply involves collecting all of the bones while avoiding the creepy crawlies that are occupying the house. The player can choose to play as either Sooty or Sweep and they differ in the weapon they use. Sooty uses a magic wand while Sweep uses a water pistol. They both have the same effect on the enemies though, stunning them for a few seconds so that the player can move past. Different items can be picked up. Keys are needed to unlock doors, sticky buns can be used to attract the bugs, magic boxes recharges the wand while water bottles refill the water pistol. There is also a two player mode where Sooty and Sweep compete in getting the largest score. This is done by snatching each others bones and by throwing custard pies.</resource>

    <resource id="a0439ffafe5f15fbef5984869b56dabe93337ac8" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Sorcerer Lord is a medieval fantasy game of tactical warfare.

The evil Shadowlord's army is threatening to overrun the peaceful country of Galanor. The alliance of races in Galanor isn't very fond of suppression, slavery or extinction, so they are preparing for war -- it's your job to coordinate the Galanorian defense.

Movement and combat are turn-based. You and the Shadowlord alternately recruit new troops, move armies on a 2D hex-map of the land and try to conquer the enemies garrisons. The outcome of fights is shown as plain text only. Although the gameplay is quite simple, there are a few tactical knacks like certain races fighting more fiercely in certain terrain types, fatigue levels and basic statistics for army leaders. Despite the game's title, magic is a rather unimportant element of chance in battles and not under your direct control.

The game contains a time limit; you've got 40 turns in easy level, less in advanced levels.

The reason for this gilt is because the King wants you to free the land from the forces of darkness.

I must admit to finding the gameplay of Sorceror's Apprentice somewhat tiresome and monotonous albeit playable. The first few credits kept me addicted so that I could progress to allow me to see later levels, but I soon saw it was a case of Ã¢â‚¬Å“seen it, done itÃ¢â‚¬Â. The graphics are far superior to the sound, although I still wasn't satisfied with what should be up to sixteen-bit standard.

In terms of graphics, Sprites are nicely drawn that jump and move fairly smoothly across bland and simplistic backdrops. The explosions are rather poor, and the overall effect is polished but could be hotter. Sounds are slightly worst than the graphics, as there is nothing to write home about.

Overall, a great disappointment that is best avoided.</resource>

This, coupled with the tendency of the animations and samples to be cut off abruptly, gives the game a very bitty feel. Secondly, it's lazy. The same death sequences are used repeatedly, even in very different scenarios.

Game looks pretty, and it's moderately entertaining for about the first 3 minutes but you will finish it inside three hours (absolute maximum) and you'll hate it so much by the end that you'll never want to see it again.</resource>

No more Shredded Wheat for you, mate. So what's behind all this? A band of deadly, virus-like aliens which have infected every part of the planet with their horrible disease, that's what. Pretty nasty, huh? So absolutely, horrendously nasty, in fact, that the combined efforts of the army, the navy, the air force, the fire service, the police, Machomen and Postman Pat have been totally liquidised in their attempt to stop it.

Just when you thought that the end of the world was nigh, when everybody thought it was OK to eat lots of cream cakes 'cos they were gonna die tomorrow anyway, a little speck became visible in the sky. Was it a bird? Was it a helicopter? Was it a speck of chocolate on your glasses? Nope, da da daaaaaa Ã¢â‚¬â€œ it was Space Harrier. Yeaaah!

With nothing but a laser and a jetpack to his name, he battles through waves of ugly looking aliens, dodges dangerous missiles, survives end-of-level tussles with great, big enormous fire-breathing dragons, tries to stop himself from splatting, slap bang into the nearest obstacles, get his eyebrows singed and still survives.
Some selfless guy, huh? Not really. He just couldn't face another day without three Shredded Wheat.</resource>

Armed with a really big gun, you have to defend yourself against the alien hordes using your wits to navigate around the screen. But watch out for those end of level bosses! Originating in the arcades, Space Harrier is a third-person rail shooter with pseudo-3D graphics, set in the same world as Fantasy Zone. The lone titular hero fights aliens with a fireball-launching cannon, which can also be used to transform the hero into a flying rocket. The protagonist is constantly in motion, but the speed of his movement can be regulated by the player.</resource>

This combined with the many flashing gaudy colors the game throws at you leads me to believe that it was born out of a bad acid trip.

There are 13 stages to complete by jetting around and blasting bad guys and bosses as they approach. The game is played from behind the main character and the landscape rushes up in 3D similar to the effect used in many car games such as Outrun.

The game uses many of the enemies and bosses from the first Space Harrier, but adds an array of new ones as well.

The background story involves a pilot who gets mixed up in a time trap and visits different time zones. There he has to shoot a certain amount of enemies to get access to the next level which increases the difficulty. Enemies either try to ram the player or shoot rockets.

New in comparison to the original Space Pilot is the power up system: shot enemies may leave symbols behind which grant advantages when picked up, e.g. a shield, automatic fire (both for a limited amount of time) or another weapon. The symbol changes if it is shot. The game scrolls in multiple directions and all few levels there is a boss to defeat.</resource>

Like every evil scientist is supposed to, Vohaul returns with an even meaner scheme. This time he intends to infest the planet Xenon with thousands of genetically engineered door-to-door life insurance salesmen. The last thing he wants is you, ace-janitor Roger Wilco, messing things up and so you are captured and brought to the planet Labion to spend the rest of your days working in Vohaul's mines. Fortunately the shuttle that takes you to the mines crashes and you're the only survivor.

Can you survive the dangers of the jungle planet Labion?nnCan you stop the evil Sludge Vohaul?

Space Quest 2: Vohaul's Revenge is the second game in Sierra's humorous Space Quest series of adventure games. It's a classic adventure game with a text-parser: you move Roger Wilco around with arrow keys, and interact with the world by typing commands. As in every Space Quest game, there are lots of ways to die.</resource>

Space Quest IV is a very dry, slow affair which seems to ignore all the encouraging advanced made in the adventure genre over the last couple of years.

The story concerns Roger being plucked from his own time and dumped back on his home planet Xenon far into the future. The place is looking a bit worse for wear and zombies wander the street. As it turns out this is the result of a super computer having gone mad after being infected by a virus caught from a pirate copy of Leisure Suit Larry (and if you think that is a hoot, then the humour is just about on your level Ã¢â‚¬â€œ it never gets any better).

The old-fashioned 16-bit graphics are, to put it politely, hideous, and the animation, such as there is, makes Roobarb And Custard look like a Disney classic. The other big problem is with the gameplay itself Ã¢â‚¬â€œ there is very little interaction with other characters. For the first quarter of the game, if you try to talk to anyone, you end up dead seconds later Ã¢â‚¬â€œ hardly an incentive to continue.

It is hard to imagine even real adventure buffs enjoying this much. It is very old-fashioned and has an air of tiredness about it. Avoid.</resource>

A multitude of highly imaginative, friendly looking critters (as they are called), innocently go about their daily business. Most are ground-based, and run up and down or leap into the air. Others swoop around the sky, merrily tweeting and quacking. All this is set against a three speed parallax scrolling background of mountains and forests.

But here come no-good aliens to put a downer on things. A mother ship hovers in wait for any unsuspecting critters to wander beneath it. It then turns on a tractor beam which pulls them into the craft. A well aimed shot will kill these, freeing the poor little cubes. On the other hand, a poorly aimed shower of laser fire could easily result in a critter being shot.

Space Ranger's appeal is mainly in its cuteness. The effective backgrounds make the game a pleasure to watch. Defender variants are nothing new, but this is the best I've seen. Space Ranger is also fun to play, and whilst not stunning, is an example to be followed by other budget companies. Definitely one of the best cheapies around. Highly recommended.</resource>

Space flight takes place in two different modes: Cruise Flight, which is ideal for travelling quickly, and Newtonian Flight, which works best for combat and precision flying. There are also three different camera views for the 3D exploration and combat. Each planetary system has a variety of destinations and obstacles to travel through via a top-down navigational map. Traveling to an outpost, a space station, or any other location with the star system can be done simply by selecting it and charting a course, or in real-time 3D flight mode.</resource>

These are the special forces that have won - and lost - the most spectacular military operations, in times of peace and war.
In Special Forces, the sequel to the award winning Airborne Ranger, you take charge of a specially trained team, equipped and organised to operate secretly behind enemy lines.
Enter zones of hostility in four different climatic regions, to sabotage, assassinate or rescue, and develop the close-quarter combat skills and personal survival techniques needed to complete your mission before the enemy even know you're there.

The concept of the game is very reminiscent of the 1975 film Rollerball. The original game was developed by Bitmap Brothers, with various remakes for many platforms since being published. It is a sequel to the 1988 game Speedball.</resource>

Viewed from above and behind, like the perspective of a racing game, the boat has to be steered between two lines of mines for the first part of each harbour. Then, with missiles, you must destroy enemy boats and the four communication towers which control them. Later, a helicopter increases your abilities with rocket launchers, speed, maneuverability and smart bombs.

The main sprite isn't bad but the horizon graphics and other sprites are simple and jerky in comparison. At least the water's silly stripes move smoothly. The Amiga version's playable, so you shouldn't have too much trouble reaching the weak shooting sections. This game is not recommended.</resource>

It's not really worth relating the plot, suffice it to say that our Diz has to save the Yolkfolk from the standard terrible fate. Along the way he has to collect and manipulate various objects, while communicating with certain other characters.

It doesn't push the Amiga to its limits, and neither is it astounding in terms of
originality, but the unique charm of CodeMasters' cartoon hero is undeniable. Perhaps the game's only flaw is that there's a little too much wandering back and forth.

It's not a classic by any means, but you'd be as mad as a March Hare if you haven't at least looked at it yet.</resource>

Our hero must guide a ball through a level to the spot marked 'In', by creating and removing blocks to alter its path. The game is prevented from being a pure clone due to the ball, which moves automatically once activated, and can be controlled by using strategically-placed blocks.

Simply reaching the ball usually involves modifying the level layout using these bricks. There are enemies moving on fixed paths which must be avoided, and bonus items to collect. Also watch for bonuses such as invincibility, gravity-alteration and teleporting. You take time to rotate, so the controls aren't truly immediate. The ball takes 20 seconds to start moving, so use this time to plan ahead.

On loading the game, you are presented with just two options: Start Game or Enter Teleport Code. The game itself is fairly slow going - your spherical battle droid has to skid about a derelict space station, avoiding holes, sliding over ice, shooting other little robots and things, while searching for the exit to the next level. On level two, it gets harder...

There's not much in Spherical Worlds to get you hooked - yes, you can upgrade your weapons and you get to do all sorts of exciting things like use teleports and collect keys - but the graphics are small and uneventful, as is the gameplay. It's okay in a sub Alien Breed 1 and 2 sort of way, and there are a few marginally distracting moments, but it doesn't hold your attention for long.</resource>

He ends up in Transilvania, which seems to be just an ordinary village.  However, he finds out that his shipmates have been captured, and are being imprisoned in the dungeons of the local castle.  Spike must rescue his friends from the mysterious castle, but first he has to escape from the (apparently friendly) villager's house where he finds himself, as the door won't open.

The game is a mix of puzzles and action.  The action involves you dodging various enemies, such as dogs, ghosts, bats, etc, and avoiding the many traps in the dungeons of the castle.

You only have a limited amount of energy, and if you lose all of it by touching enemies or traps, you lose a life.  If you lose all your lives you lose the game.

The puzzles, which are mostly fairly simple, involve both the use of objects, such as money to bribe a guard, and switches that perform various functions, such as deactivating traps.  

Keys are very important, as they are needed to unlock your shipmates' cells.  Some cells are protected by guards, who must be tempted away somehow to get to the cells they are guarding.

Controlling GERALD, you must move through the isometrically viewed landscape (largely flick-screen on the ST). There are two skill levels; the harder one features more of the precarious ledges and falls of Spindizzy. Each one takes you to a different matrix of levels, which can be played in different orders and each consist of 10 screens, with a bonus level at the end.

You have limited energy, which can be recharged by collecting crystals. Fuel is limited, and is reduced by contact with hazards - generating a replacement GERALD takes time. There are many gates which are opened by running into spaces of the same colour. There are also aliens to avoid, and most movement is along thin slippery ledges with heavily inertia-based controls.

The gameplay involves up to 4 players, which can be either human or computer, each taking on spots of a particular colour. Starting from opposite corners, they take it in turns to move, either by 'reproducing' one of their spots to form another one in an adjacent square, or by making a jump, losing the square you did have but taking one two spaces away. When a piece lands next to one of another colour, that piece changes colour into that of their opponent. The winner of each round is either the last player with any pieces left, or the player who has the most pieces left when the level is full.</resource>

The split-screen shows both spies at the same time. Play with a friend or against the machine.

The black spy and the white spy are out to outsmart each other before the time bell rings. Find the needed objects (money, passport, secret plans and airport door key) by searching rooms in the embassy, which include desks, file cabinets and other furniture. Foil your opponent by setting creative booby traps in the various rooms (a bomb in a dresser drawer, for instance). Traps can be disarmed with objects found in rooms (a water bucket from a firebox on the wall will disarm the bomb in the prior example). When all the items are together in the secret briefcase, head for the airport door.</resource>

Spy series reached it's end in Arctic Antics. Spy vs Spy: Arctic Antics is an Action/Arcade game, for one or two players, developed by First Star Software and published by Wicked Soft. Released in the UK in 1989 for several contemporary platforms.

The duo, the White Spy (you) and the deadly Black Spy continue their battle. This time, the scrap takes place in the frozen Arctic, the objective: Find the essential components of a brand new rocket before you freeze to death! And more importantly, before your opponent -- the deadly Black Spy -- escapes his own fate or completes the mission instead! Your body temp. is effectively your health. You can get warmer by popping into an Igloo and standing by the fire for a few moments. Remember though! You've only a limited time to complete your mission, so don't dally!

Overall this game is quite fun, if lacking staying power, being the same thing over and over. It's main saving grace is the two-player option. Without it, the game just isn't as funny. I mainly played two-player and then ran through, completing, each difficulty. At higher difficulties it does present a challenge, but I don't think I'll be playing this game as often as others that are similar, due to the repetitive game-play and fiddly controls.</resource>

The gameplay is essentially the same - groups of 3 variably-colored blocks fall towards the bottom of a 6x18 grid, and you must arrange them into groups of 3 of the same colour - except that the blocks are grouped horizontally rather than vertically.

Each individual brick falls as far as it can when you place the trio, so they won't necessarily all end up on the same line. Blocks fall as far as possible to fill gaps when lines are completed, so there are never gaps in the arrangement the way you get in Tetris. Each level sets you a target number of lines to form - 4 or 5 in a row count as 2 and 3 lines respectively for this calculation, a lá Klax. Horizontal lines score the least, with diagonals the most lucrative and vertical in between (this change from Columns makes sense considering the different building method).

The levels are taller than the screen, so you can move up or down them and take on a selection of the different enemy waves each time.

At the start of the game you choose your primary and secondary weapon. Pressing fire briefly activates the primary; holding it down activates the secondary - therefore you can't use both at the same time. These can be powered up to various levels, and changed around by picking up tokens, although switching weapon or losing a life reduces your firepower initially. Continues and extra lives are on offer, as are a simultaneous 2-player mode, choice of sounds effects and/or music, and a music test menu.

Your task is to fight them off using only an obsolete Airborne Ground Attack Vehicle. This was designed as the ultimate combat machine, with sophisticated hardware up to Draziw Yarg's high standards. It has a fully-rechargeable shield, plasma drive unit, an inbuilt scanner and 10,000-sector map, a top speed of 2550 Urads and two homing missiles.

The game is viewed from within AGAV's cockpit, with control over speed, weapon targeting and firing. There are several control options to decide exactly how the craft works, with fixed or floating sighting, and the option of automatic centering, allowing you to balance the game between easy sighting and advanced shooting ranges.

Repair depots must be visited frequently, as they can refill the weapon bays as well as repairing the ship. Crucially, the Egron Stargliders need 3 missiles to shoot down, so at least 1 visit to a depot is required to complete this job, at which point you move up to the next, harder, level.

As the title implies, Starlord is set in a science-fiction world, as opposed to the fantasy universes of those previous games.

Your family are Starlords of a single planet, but seek dominance of a vast space consisting of 1000 individually-ruled planets. If you are to come out on top you will have to manage resources across each of your starbases, using revenue to ensure enough fuel, food and minerals are available. Trade with other leaders and form tactical agreements.

To actually take over planets, you will have to lead your ships into space combat, which is played out in multiple-view 3D.

To do this he must blow bubbles to catch the grubs that they feed on and guide them through the level by blowing on them or nudging them past any obstacles in the way to the nest where T'yungunz live.  To complete a level, you must make sure that a certain number of T'yungunz are fully fed so they go to sleep.  If they don't get enough food then eventually they die.

The levels are full of contraptions such as bellows, and obstacles such as spikes and fire that will burst the bubbles.  Some of these can be activated or deactivated using various switches.

Usually Steg navigates each level by walking on the floor, and also he can climb up the walls and even walk on the ceiling.  There are also devices he can contruct out of the parts from the Acme Bionic Bitz Catalogue, such as the Rocket Pack, and Bionic Legs, which allow different ways of getting around each level.

You are up against Gir Draxon and his evil Arcturan army. You will go from star system to star system, fighting his forces. When the enemies have been destroyed, a mothership flies overhead and beams down the Guardian of the star system, a giant enemy ship. When you reach the Arcturus star system, you will fight Gir Draxon!

The game is played from a first person view looking out from the cockpit of the Raven. It is in true polygonal 3D. Aside from a graphical and aural overhaul and the addition of cutscenes, the remake's gameplay and level design is virtually identical to the original, right down to the placement of each and every enemy. The major differences are the added &amp;quot;power modules&amp;quot; (e.g. supercannon, superjump) and a major boss creature at the end of every level.</resource>

    <resource id="0afd7641912c988c79d57b330b5e981a5d9752f5" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Storm Master is a 1991 video game for the Amiga, Atari ST and PC, produced by the now-defunct French developer Silmarils, which placed the player as the head of government for a fictional semi-medieval country.

Similarly to most of the games produced by Silmarils, Storm Master took place on a European-fantasy world. Gameplay revolved around the governance and management of the country of Eolia in an ongoing war against its neighbour, Shaarkania, with the ultimate goal of sacking (and, by inference, destroying) all enemy cities.[1][2]

The game was notable for a blend of turn-based strategy interspersed with live-action battles. This took the form of aerial battles against enemy air fleets or air defences and required the player to launch ballistic missiles against enemy ships or batteries. Other real-time elements of the game involved the player conducting a religious ceremony with the goal of increasing the natural wind energy of the nation. This element of gameplay was further enhanced by requiring the player to dispatch government ministers around the country to develop or industrialise various aspects of the state. The game was further noted by Amiga Action as having an innovative 'advance through time' feature, allowing the player some control over the rate at which time passed in the game.</resource>

Each player starts with 40 pieces; made up by the flag, 5 bombs, and an assortment of 9 types of military units. 

After these have been placed, each player takes it in turn to move their pieces. Other than scouts (which are the least powerful) the units can only move one space at a time.The flag and bombs can't be moved during the game, so watch out for any squares the computer does not move when it otherwise logically should, and these could be your goal.

When you choose a square occupied by an opposition piece, combat arises, and the higher-numbered piece is lost from the game. You have no way of knowing what strength the opposition pieces are until you have hit them. 

This computerized interpretation has 3 different board layouts, a selection of automatic setups with different strategic benefits, and a demo mode.

    <resource id="6dc5e70f9685cd41753a1330c98df03216233185" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Street Racer is a go-kart racing game which combines racing with violence.

Characters can strike opponents with their fists and must avoid explosives littered around the track. The game's characters possess unique power-ups such as the Screaming Banshee, Batmobile, magic carpet and tri-plane.

The game features the ability to race various championships beginning with the Bronze Championship and moving on to progressively more difficult competitions. An alternative one-on-one mode is also available. The game awards points for final race positions, with bonus points given for accolades such as fastest lap. The competitor with the most points after all races wins the Championship. The game includes a &amp;quot;Rumble&amp;quot; mode in which players attempt to force opponents from an arena. The &amp;quot;Soccer&amp;quot; mode is a free-for-all football match with one goal and in which players tackle by colliding with the opponent.</resource>

    <resource id="fa6295e47d71d8db66095bf02f08852ac284386a" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Street Rod is a car racing game with a difference - and loads of atmosphere as well. It's set in the days when cars were really cars and milk bars were really milk bars. First you'll have to buy your car - look through the classified ads in the newspaper on the screen. Then get to work in the body-shop - maybe a new paint job in something tasteful like hot pink. Then it's out with the engine. A workshop screen lets you pull it to pieces, make timing adjustments and add high performance parts.

Then it's off to the race track. A cruise down the main street to show off your wheels will always result in a challenge - and usually there's a little wager on the side. The race sequences are difficult, and you only get one chance. Crash your car and it's back to the body repair shop. Not only that, your bank balance drops alarmingly. You can use joystick or mouse controls - I'm still not sure which I like best, but I suspect the joystick gives the best Ã¢â‚¬Å“feelÃ¢â‚¬Â.

Graphics are very nice, music is atmospheric - all in all, Street Rod is a hot game.</resource>

The standard basketball dunks, passes and steals are on offer. An opposition player drilling the ball into you sees you gain possession.

One or two players can join in, choosing their team of 3 from the 10 kids you are offered, each with different abilities. There are 3 computer difficulty levels.

In Russia, the evil Grand Master Meio has begun his insane plot to take over the universe. A lone figure drops from a stealth glider into Meio's base. He is Hiryu, Super A-Class Strider. His mission is to defeat the Grand Master and put an end to his plotting once and for all.

Converted from the classic arcade game, Strider lets you run, jump, perform acrobatics and climb walls and overhangs. You wield a plasma sword, called a Cypher, through 5 levels fighting robots and guards, with mid- and end-level bosses.

He must fight his way through a forest, a ruined city, underground colonies, a roof-top battle, and finally the prison ship in which the Megantan leader is held.

The gameplay is similar to the original, consisting of running, jumping and attacking, with a very dynamic central character. The laser gun can be used while standing still; moving attacks with the sword are still possible, with the two weapons combining similarly to the Switchblade games. Tokens can be collected, which will turn you into a robot to face the end-of-level enemies if enough are collected.</resource>

    <resource id="40abcb6b0217353cb70f4d50dcaf6fcee436da1c" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Subbuteo recreates the famous table football game, which makes for something very different from Sensible/Kick Off/FIFA style games. It's effectively a turn-based strategy game of sorts, as each player has 30 seconds to make their move (within a 30 minute match length), which involves first selecting a player, then aiming the direction in which he will be flicked, then the power and swerve of the flick are determined by the length of time the button is held down for. 

With any luck, your player will hit the ball, and hit it such that it doesn't leave the playing area, and doesn't hit an opponent. If any of those rules are violated, possession passes to the opposition. Before each flick, the team not in possession can make a 'defensive flick' involving moving one of their players into a potential blocking position (without hitting the ball or an opponent, as this is a foul).

Despite new species, background graphics, and different commodities, gameplay is still M.U.L.E. at its heart: up to four players vie in a cutthroat competition to be the richest businessman in a futuristic economy. The different phases of M.U.L.E., e.g. land grant, production, and marketing, are preserved intact and are greatly enhanced by intuitive mouse-based interface and 16-bit graphics. The auction interface, which is the best part of M.U.L.E., is still as furious and fun as ever, with computer players that are aggressive enough to pose a real challenge. Unlike Linel's Traders, another M.U.L.E. clone, Subtrade does not introduce new gameplay options or the number of commodities.

Overall, Subtrade is definitely one of the best M.U.L.E. clones, if not THE best. M.U.L.E. fans will definitely enjoy this one, although the disappointing lack of tournament mode means that an average game with 4 players can be finished in less than 1-2 hours.</resource>

The game is a platform game, made up of four levels, each made up of a collection of inter-connected screens. There are a variety of objects to collect, but the aim on each level is to collect the parts (found in ACME crates) of a vehicle to get to the next one.

When all the parts are in place, there is a sub-game where the vehicle is constructed, although this is only for bonus points.</resource>

    <resource id="9bf555a96c6b69f9536d20a2f9b00af410eb8bfa" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Super C, a port of the classic 1988 Konami arcade game Super Contra.

Like in the original Contra, the game can be played by up to two players simultaneously. The left player controls Bill (who wears green in this installment), while the right player controls Lance (who wears purple). The game retains the side-scrolling format from the previous game, discarding only the pseudo-3D and fixed screen segments. Instead, Super Contra features vertically-scrolling stages played from an overhead perspective, in which the player can move in eight directions. The controls remain mostly the same during the side-scrolling segments, with the only difference is that the player can now control the height of his jump by holding the joystick upwards or downwards while pressing the jump button.

The player can replace their default gun with one of four possible weapons by destroying the flying item capsules that appear throughout each stage. The available weapons include a machine gun, a spread gun, a bomb gun and a laser gun. This time, weapons can now be upgraded by picking up the same power-up twice in a row, resulting in greater destructive power. The power-ups in Super Contra are represented by the actual guns the player's character wields instead of the Falcon-shaped letter icons from the previous game. During overhead stages, the player can also pick up a &amp;quot;hyper shell&amp;quot; item that destroys all on-screen enemies, which is launched by pressing the jump button. The hyper shell can be launched at any time during these stages and the player can store more than one at a time.

The game consists of five stages, which are set in a military base, a jungle and the alien's lair. Stages 1, 3 and 4 are played from the standard side-scrolling perspective, while Stages 2 and 5 employ the top-down perspective. Throughout each stage, the player must fight his way through the enemy's line of defense (including a few mid-bosses) until reaching the final target awaiting at the end.

After running out of lives, the player is allowed to continue up to five times before the game is entirely over; this depends on the DIP switch settings. Unlike the predecessor, each player can now continue at any time, with no need to wait until the other player runs out of lives.[2]</resource>

There are 9 tracks at each of the 4 difficulty levels, which can be raced in any order (although the last track you race is made harder than usual). In the races you win money, which can be spent on the usual handling and power upgrades, as well as forward-shooting missiles. You must finish in the top 3 of each race to progress - initially there are 4 computer opponents, but more are added as you progress through the game

You can upgrade your car throughout the game via the shop section. You are given an initial price, but also a number of options of things to say to the salesman – get the right combination and the price will drop.

In this game you race a motorcycle around the world, completing each section of track within a time limit. There are other bikes on the road, but beating this is not important, so they can be thought of as moving obstacles. Each continent is a different difficulty level: Africa is beginner, Asia is junior, the Americas are senior, and Europe is expert.  

This is a very simple and straightforward game, viewed from behind the bike in 2D (so the screen does not tilt with the bike). The right/left controls are steering, and up/down are gear changes. Your cycle is always moving, and your speed strictly depends on the gear you are in, although contact or running off the road slows the bike down.

Il est possible de les faire pivoter et le but est de parvenir à les disposer de telle façon qu'elles forment un circuit fermé. Mais attention : on ne dispose que de quelques secondes pour poser chaque pièce (4 secondes très exactement) et on perd une vie si on n'y parvient pas dans le temps imparti.
Les différents modes de jeu permettent de jouer indéfiniment (&amp;quot;endless&amp;quot; façon Tetris), ou bien de passer des niveaux avec un nombre donné de circuits fermés à effectuer à chaque fois. On peut jouer à 2 simultanément de façon coopérative ou en s'affrontant en écran splitté.

The levels start with varying amounts of boulders, and as soon as you shoot at one of them, it breaks up into 2 more which are half the size. Eventually they become small enough that they disappear. 

Your character is a human sprite, so you’re bound to the ground unless you can jump onto one of the strategically-placed ledges. There are several different weapons available, which you don’t lose when you die.

There are numerous different control options – the standard one involves always firing in the direction you’re aiming, but others include one where your firing direction can be changed by flicking the joystick with fire held down, an option where you move using the main 4 directions and use the bottom-left and bottom-right diagonal to rotate the firing direction, and an option where you use one joystick for direction of movement, and the other for direction of fire.

King of the four wheel drive pick-up truck, Ivan has won more trophies and awards than you can shake a 4x4 at. His exploits saw Leland write a coin-op and now Graftgold have taken on the task of converting the Iron Man coin-op.

It's the start of the racing season and the four-by-four trucks are ready and raring to go, Iron Man is there and so are three other contestants revving up on the start line. With the flag going down, the trucks nitro away from the start line, bumping and bashing their way past each other up hill and down ditch. Coming first is recommended but the only requirement for staying in the championship is that you complete the fifth lap ahead of any other computer-controlled car (and that includes Iron Man Ivan himself).

Presentation of the game is really good: Three-player mode, attractive start-up screens, select a country option (complete with anthems). Multiload for each track but it's not excessive. Great attention to graphics detail in the relatively small trucks and their movement with plenty of frames of animation, great dirt shading and excellent detail in the extra effects. A jolly variety of suitably fast paced tunes (different one for each course) together with good samples. Separate country anthems, title and trophy screen tunes.

Overall, a highly playable Super Sprint variant, proving great fun with the multiplayers option, high quality graphics and excellent attention to detail.</resource>

The basic aim is to ride a motocross bike through hazardous courses within the time limits.

The game uses a split-screen display, with a big window viewed from the side as well as a longer-range aerial view - the latter is useful for dodging hazards to the left or right, as the side-view doesn't demonstrate these accurately. The bike has 3 gears, and you must use a low gear to go uphill. You will need to do wheelies to ensure good landings from the big jumps, and to clear divots in the ground.

An avalanche of unanswered questions buries Downhill Challenge before the skiier gets a third of the way down the hill. The game attempts to simulate slalom skiing, downhill skiing, giant slalom skiing, and ski jumping.



You had better know the rules of these Nordic events already, because the skimpy manual is little help. I was left wondering: How does the program keep time in the downhill events? What do the splits mean and where are they taken? What is the penalty for missing a gate? How many times do you go downhill in the competition mode (thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also one for practice) before you can move on to the next event? Besides pressing the Shift key or joystick button for extra height, how do you control the skiier while jumping?



At least you have above average graphics to look at while you ponder. The scenery you ski toward but never quite reach is nearly breathtaking. The viewpoint of the game is from about 15 feet behind the skiier. The game would come alive much better if it actually put you up on the skis with perhaps only your poles showing in each hand, and if it didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t sound as if you have a motor attached to your back after the starting bell.</resource>

The game features both overhead and 3D sections. In the overhead part, you must eliminate enemy ships and asteroids across several zones in each world. The 3D sections consist of underwater tunnels that link one world to another and they are each defended by a guardian you must defeat.</resource>

This game of skill was conceived by two Soviet programmers. Time is of the essence as you try to rotate and/or flip moving pieces to fit as they descend from the top of the screen. Make the pieces fit precisely with the others to form a compelte row with no blank spaces. The quicker you position each piece and allow it to drop into place, the better your score.
As complete rows are formed they automatically disappear from the screen. When ten rows have been successfully removed, you advance to a high level and the pieces descend faster. Therefore the further you get, the more challenging TETRIS? becomes.</resource>

    <resource id="2e406560bbce0fd9ed3b55f5262d84f36eebb495" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Side view hockey game. Gameplay allows for players to choose from either the centre or goalie positions, a 2 player option allows for head to head play or co-operative play where one player is the centre and the other the goalie. Coaching decisions such as line changes and strategy choices can be made during a game between whistles. Player creation, development and trades all take place before and after games.

Gameplay as a centre was limited due to only having one action button, this meant that when playing as a centre, pressing the &amp;quot;fire&amp;quot; button would cause the player to swing his stick. If the player had possession of the puck this would result in a shot. Swinging the stick with or without the puck also had the potential to knock other players down depending on their proximity to the swinging stick, often resulting in a penalty, if no penalty is called the player knocked down would spin for several seconds before getting back up (if you as the centre were knocked down you were effectively out of the play until you regained your feet).

The game was notable for its player creation and development system, the game used &amp;quot;trade points&amp;quot; as a measure of value when creating new players, trading players and running team practices. The more points spent on an activity, in general the better the result. Players also aged and their skills declined, the most noticeable being speed.</resource>

The goal of Supremacy is to create and protect a network of planetary colonies and defeat a computer adversary who is trying to do the same. There are four skill levels, each represented by an enemy race, and each featuring a progressively stronger opponent. The more advanced a system is, the more freedom a player has when purchasing spacecraft. Higher skill levels also result in different numbers of planets in each system.

The game was initially released for the Amiga and Atari ST computers in the beginning of 1990.</resource>

Shape of tiles varies from big and small squares to triangles or hexagons. If tiles have no neighbor tiles you may take appropriate tiles from the pocket of the limited size to eliminate the rest of the tiles. Finishing the level, player will be transferred to the higher level if the results of the current level were high enough for such level. But to finish level successfully, player should acquire the certain number of points and to be qualified for the next level. The difficulty also raises and depends on quantity of colours, the shape of the tiles, and time limit presence. Undo moves are also present, but such moves decrease your final results. Game may be saved in progress and loaded later. 

Best scores and levels will be written in High Score Table.

The gameplay is platform and ladders based, set both inside and outside. The layout of the territories becomes visible as you progress, and they can contain bonus weapons and secret rooms. Unlike the sequel you start without weaponry, and this is gained directly, rather than you collecting coins and trading them at shop sections. Holding down fire progressively builds up your fighting power.

Their job is to destroy the swarms of aliens – including flying saucers, tie fighters, space jellyfish, unidentifiable blobs, and the like – and dodge their fire. This can be achieved by shooting them with the standard zapper or use a smart missile to destroy everything in sight. 

When an entire swarm is destroyed, getting the token that appears give the player a roving sight, sideways-firing missiles, extra lives, extra missiles, and so on. Between each swarm, a meteor shower appears, and players need to avoid being hit. At the end of each level, players have to destroy a guardian to proceed to the next, and the smart missiles cannot be used to destroy them.

Call me old-fashioned, but I'm in it for the effects--explosions are good, and the last blue 'rippley-looking level' really hit the eye-cones. Music's good.

Different joystick combinations let your fighter perform high, middle or low attacking moves as well as dodge or block his opponent's attacks. Fighters receive scores for successful attacks. The more difficult or effective the attack, the higher the score. Unless one fighter is knocked out, the fighter who has the highest score at the end of three rounds wins.

Although the game is shown from an isometric perspective, it is not possible to move in three dimensions.

He's not from East Enders and he doesn't have a mate called Terry but he does own the mining rights to T'ngl-y-wd. Spit in my eye, eh? Isn't the world a small place guv'nor? Well, yeah, it is a small place and that is why T'ngl-y-wd isn't on it Ã¢â‚¬â€œ actually. It's a 'small undistinguished planet in a remote galaxy'. Arthur didn't worry about it much until he found out that it contained some pretty valuable stones, then he shot his mouth off over a couple of pints of beer and was elbowed out by the mining company. Yup, those nice men at the mining centre have hidden Arthur's documents and re-established the planet's operational base. There's a court case in ten days and Arthur (sounds a bit like my uncle, Ripperbile) needs to find those papers or he's out on his ear.

This is definitely an arcade-style adventure weighted towards the arcade. You might find the puzzles pretty devious, but it's all a question of having the right thing at the right time. If you like your adventures grilled and ready to eat you probably won't find Tanglewood instantly appealing. You could spend ages exploring this deep and mysterious world Ã¢â‚¬â€œ there must be some juicy titbits somewhere Ã¢â‚¬â€œ but it takes so long to get anywhere that you might decide to throw your disk over the nearest bridge and cut your toenails instead. But watch out Ã¢â‚¬â€œ you might start enjoying yourself!</resource>

It consists of a set of 7 shapes, representing squares, triangles and trapezoids, which must be arranged to form a pre-defined pattern. In this version there are 200, representing things such as animals and buildings.

The shapes are on the right of the screen, and you move the mouse cursor over one to select it, then place it onto the shape as required. They can be rotated using the right mouse button. 

All this is done against a time limit. As well as points for clearing a level, you get bonus time for completing them with time to spare. This bonus time can then be used on later levels if you run out of the allotted time. Once you have no bonus time, you can dig into your main score to provide more time.

There are two difficulty levels - the Novice level sees time elapse half as quickly as the Expert mode, and presents the levels in an approximate order of difficulty, whereas in Expert mode they are in randomised order.

All the strange places and creatures he can dream about really exist in an alternate reality. One of those creatures, named Franklin Snarl, traveled through the device to our reality and kidnapped Gramps, teleporting him into the crazy world of Tonetown. He hopes that Gramps will always remain asleep, which assures Snarl's own existence!

Now it's up to you, the hero of the game to travel to the alternate dimension of Tonetown and to rescue your grandfather. You interact with the environment by either typing in commands, or choosing one of the action icons available as interface. The game, therefore, combines text-based interaction with the more modern &amp;quot;point and click&amp;quot; approach.

    <resource id="3d89ce1648d4590e3386858d171308f057e44076" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">You control Thomas, a strange-looking but vaguely cutesy animal of some description in an ultra-fast platform game. There are 50 levels, split into 5 groups of 10.

Each one has a certain number of gems, and your task is to collect a certain number of them (for example, level 2 has 55 and you need at least 40) and then find the exit, all within the time limits. The yellow gems are worth 50 points and the purple ones 100, although the purple ones donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t appear to be more precariously-placed, and the total makes no distinction, so this is for colour as much as anything. Once youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve got the required amount, the gems double in value, tempting you to continue to explore

The levels are infested with cutesy-looking baddies, such as birds and bears, which canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be killed, and must be avoided, as contact with them costs you time as Thomas picks himself up. You can jump on the heads of some of them, which gives a small points bonuses. The layouts include ropes to ascend, moving platforms and more. Some levels are entirely vertically-scrolling, seeing you progress up the ledges of a tree or similar.

If you run out of time you lose a life, but the level isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t reset, so you keep the number of gems collected and have a fresh set of time. This means that you are far less likely to lose a second life on the level, similarly to Chase HQ.</resource>

To save the kingdom, the player has to win all battles against the enemy drivers. There are 25 levels in total and in each the player has to kill all of the opposition by trapping them so that they crash into a wall or into one of the cycles' trail. The player has three lives and when they are gone there is a continue option to keep trying at the level. The levels get progressively harder with more enemy drivers and obstacles such as turrets, walls and ditches. The game also has a two player mode.</resource>

You can start from scratch, with your character given a random 1 to 18 for six basic attributes: Intelligence, intuition, ego, strength, constitution and dexterity, together with a number of silver pieces. You can enter a previously saved character from disc. Thankfully this interpretation has superior graphics attributes of a character from an earlier game. You can restore a previous game saved at any point within Apshai.

Each realm has four levels. Dungeons and Dragons followers will find levels 1 to 2 are appropriate to third level, and the lower levels to fourth and sixth level characters. There are special commands, such as examining a wall for secret doors, opening doors, searching for traps, picking up treasures, listening for monsters, talking to monsters, healing with salves or elixirs, checking the and a few healing salves, you are inventory of your treasures or saving the game or character for future use. Most levels of each realm have 50 to 60 rooms, so there is plenty to explore. Some monsters are tied to particular locations, but others wander around looking for the odd meal. The innkeeper will pay you for any treasure you have collected so you have a chance to add to or improve your equipment.

There is a little more to Apshai than straightforward monster bashing, but nowhere near the depth of puzzles and quests to be found in more modern offerings such as Ultima and Bard's Tale.</resource>

    <resource id="7219d721f88a0d7e3f277a726530a7bc19af3377" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">The story is that a terminator sent from the future to kill the leader of the resistance, Sarah Connor, failed miserably and now the enemy is targeting the future leader, Sarah's son John. But young John has a guardian angel (you) and your job is to protect him from the said evil.

Using a point-of-view perspective, you target a gunsight at a host of baddies and blow them to smithereens. These include Endoskeletons with rifles, machinegun-toting Cyborgs, acid-chucking laboratory technicians and various devilsome airborne craft. You start with a machine gun and 25 guided missiles, which are best used sparingly. Along the way, there are a whole host of pick-ups to gather including extra credits, protective shields, and a plethora of destructive firepower. They appear in kit cases and you must click to open them and click again to obtain them. It is seriously fast action. There are seven levels to tackle including a van chase where you battle against a T-1000 in a helicopter. This is a faithful conversion of the arcade game and the graphics and sound effects remain true to the original with sampled speech and crisp explosions and gunfire.

Although Terminator 2 does not break new ground or offer a great deal of variety, it is perfectly adequate in the playability stakes. In two-player mode, it is fast, furious and fun. The sheer volume of baddies make it virtually impossible for one player to take them all out, but with two you can dispose of them at will as well as collecting the plentiful pick-ups. As the man himself once said, &amp;quot;I'll be back&amp;quot;. But not until next Tuesday.</resource>

Select one of the five most intrepid Adventurers from England, France, Germany, Japan, and the U.S. to spearhead the search. Professor Renegade was last seen in the unexplored region of the highest Tibetan ranges; an area populated by creatures and conditions of the professor's own design: venomous stone snakes, reptilian birds, and acid storms. Not only must your Adventurer survive these tests of courage, but he must and properly use such curious objects as spurs, a vacuum cleaner, and a unicycle. Once you locate the professor and convince him to help, you'll need to help him construct an anti-asteroid deflector to prevent the destruction of earth.</resource>

The planet Colian is a case in point; it has plentiful stocks of tough metal Aluma, the explosive Detonite, and the energy giving Quaza crystals. The units which are mining them are under the control of the Empire, and are forced to produce destructive Terrorpod units.

The rival Federation attempts to shut this operation down, and sends you to the surface in a Defence Strategy Vehicle. Your task is to find each of the six bases before the Empire can destroy evidence of them. Destroy all the Terrorpods in order to reach the bases.

The action is viewed from your DSV, as you move and shoot at any encroaching Terrorpods. Colian has a heavy inertia field, so you are always moving. You have guided missiles at your disposal, although these use up some of your limited Detonite stocks. Missiles will also be aimed at you; avoid these.

As all this action unfolds, you are trying to ensure that enough components can be produced in the mines, and can be retrieved in order to go towards the Federation's own building efforts. Collect the resultant products to attach them to your DSV.

Terry is a small, energetic character who is an expert with a yo-yo. His adventure takes him through 12 levels where he encounters numerous obstacles such as hedgehogs, snails, bridges, rivers and poisonous mushrooms that pop up at the least expected moment! Armed with his yo-yo or rocks, Terry must slay the enemies to be able to continue on his adventure.
Included in the game are hidden bonus levels, extra lives to gain, and objects to find to increase time.
Very compulsive arcade gameplay.</resource>

Anyone with even a basic knowledge of recent British history will recognise the immortal words used in the title, so it is no shock to find out that this game is a combat flight sim based on aircraft that were around in the first half of the Second World War.

First of all, you can decide which side to fight for, but remember the decision here limits which craft are available to fly Ã¢â‚¬â€œ no Spitfires in the Luftwaffe! The Brits have got Hurricanes and Spits to fight in while the German have not only fighters, but medium and long range bombers and dive bombers. Each plane has several missions set aside for it that can be played in any order. The missions are varied and range from straight dogfights to scramble and intercept missions. Once a mission is completed the combat records are updated and stored to disk.

Then there are the campaign games if you feel like playing for a long while, where you take charge of your side's airforce and try to either bomb the blazes out of blighty or not, depending which side you are on.</resource>

You pilot a Battletech-style robot capable of switching from a 'mech into a jet at any time.

Your 'mech also contains a shield that can be activated to protect you from harm, but this lasts for a few seconds and uses up some of your life energy.

    <resource id="a1dfdf10bebbd050535c77aaa558fce2101f1cf8" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">The Third Courier is set in the era of the 'cold war', and the action takes place in Germany. The player is an American spy, and his mission is to recover stolen NATO defense plans.

You start off in your apartment, which contains a computer, bugging equipment and an answerphone, as well as useful items such as money and a passport. A compass on screen is used to move around, with symbols appearing on the left and right of the status screen to indicate when something important is to the west or east of you. 

You will have to explore the city streets, with the aid of taxis and the Autobahn. Talk to important people and buy key objects, and then sneak around spying on anyone who seems suspicious. Encounters with enemy agents, muggers and tramps can turn violent; when they do, use your gun quickly to ensure they are shot first.

The Thundercat must defeat Mumm-Ra's forces, which range from dwarves to bats. Although you start with only a sword, more can be collected by attacking the various containers through the levels - later weapons can destroy these enemies quicker, and allow attacks from a distance. Reaching the end of each level sees bonuses for time and kills. The path through the game can be varied on later levels, so you can play it through more than once and find new sections, even though the individual levels only scroll left-to-right.

As a pilot in the &amp;quot;Ground Defense Games&amp;quot;, you must make your way through several arenas built on different planets. You can choose from four different ships, each with different properties (better/worse acceleration, top speed, or turning speed).

When you enter the arena, you are given several pyramids that you must defend from robotic drones sent out to collapse them. In addition to defending your pyramids, you must destroy the spawning centers that spawn not only drones, but an array of robotic fighters to hunt you down.

When you destroy a fighter, sometimes it will leave behind an upgrade pod (shield, turbo, power, or twin-fire). There are also tracks that you can latch your ship onto to travel the perimeter of the arena quickly.

At the end of each round, your performance is reviewed, and if you did good, your ship is upgraded and you move on to the next round.

They have four missions to complete in turn.

Each of these involves a two-man squad, whom you can switch between at any time. Each must select the correct objects to bring beforehand. You will have to move through the screens via lifts and ladders, avoid hazards and solve puzzles.

Mission one is set in a mine shaft, which is rapidly flooding and has two miners trapped. Next up is a nuclear submarine stranded after hitting a mine, which must be repaired and reactivated before it explodes. During this mission, you discover evidence of the miner's construction, so must break into a bank to steal the appropriate documents. This reveals that a madman is holding International Rescue to ransom, so you must finally travel to his lair to stop him.

    <resource id="de735c885dc90025e5487f4132eb07fb93f49bd4" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Time Bandit is a Gauntlet-style arcade game with text adventure elements.

Having nothing to do with the Terry Gilliam movie Time Bandits, this game utilises the time-travel theme for a fast-paced preview of the concept getting famous with Gauntlet two years later. Your bandit visits 16 different worlds throughout time to grab as much loot as possible and, in the long run, do some universe-saving stuff as well.

Each of the 16 locations -- featuring such varied places like a medieval arena, a bomb factory, a wrecked spaceship and a ghost town -- is basically a labyrinth filled with treasure and -- you guessed it -- monsters. You've got to dodge these or blast them with your weapon, while collecting keys, opening doors and searching for the exit. Although theoretically each location consists of 16 sub-levels, these are merely the basic layout flipped or mirrored, some items redistributed and the monster speed increased. After completing a level, you return to the world map, where you may freely choose the next challenge (nice) and save your game (very nice).

Interestingly, Time Bandit tries to spice up the fast arcade action with text adventure scenes. Due to this strange mixture, you will occasionally bump into persons or computer consoles with which interaction is possible. For example, you've got to explore and repair the damaged spaceship Excalibur. However, the parser is crude at best; you'll have to know exactly what to do, or else you will trigger no reaction.

Gaming veterans will discover a score of elements of and allusions to arcade classics, such as Tutankham, Pac-Man, Centipede, Bomberman, and others.</resource>

Each playfield represents a certain period of the human evolution such as Prehistory, Crusades, Prohibition or Berlin Wall. On each level some animation takes place, and you should perform your goal until it logically finishes. 

The tiles are triangles of different colors, sometimes combined in groups, appear in one corner of the playfield and should be put in another place based on the player's strategy in the way to do not block the path for other tiles. When four triangle tiles with adjacent tiles of different colors formed a square, this square will be eliminated from playfield with its part and no tiles may be placed or moved here. Adjacent tiles of the same colors will be eliminated from playfield, but playfield will remain untouched. Tiles may be moved on the playfield and rotated over the center of the square. Also playfield may include different obstacles, which may influence on moving/rotation of your tiles to make it more difficult, and they should be avoided in any possible way.

Finishing the level will give you the code, which may be used later to access this level. There are 30 levels available to play.

In the first episode, Max gives his girlfriend Jessica a ring for her birthday when the Skunks come and kidnap her, presumably because the ring contains something they are interested in. They take Jessica to the prehistoric past. Max visits his friend Lucas who, as luck would have it, has just invented a time machine in the shape of a motorbike. Max takes the time machine to the past to try and save Jessica.</resource>

You control a cross-hair, and press fire while over a Brainy to take or give up control of its motion. Running out of time costs you a life. The challenge lies in the fact that you can only control the direction in which a Brainy will walk. Once this is set, he will continue to walk until he hits a wall, an obstacle or another Brainy. To make things a bit more complicated, there are various obstacles like arrows that change the direction a Brainy is walking in and items than can optionally be picked up.</resource>

    <resource id="cf45876a7fbc769ac841a04ff24f4b09f28f15ba" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">On planet Agaris IV, two races fight for power on an endless war. When the Klutes and the Furfurians' dispute made their planet inhospitable, they needed a new battleground. Their troops where teleported to planet Earth, where everything, they discover, is 100 times bigger. Their battles are thus a small event there, taking place out of the attention of the humans.

Tiny Troops is a real-time strategy game, with gameplay similar to Cannon Fodder. It supports up to 2 players in split-screen mode, and mouse or joystick control. Before starting a level, a screen is shown where the player must select which units are going to be on his troop. There's several types of units (foot soldiers, grenadiers, etc). Clicking the general gives a hint and the main objective of the level (that usually is about killing the enemy and destroying their base). Most of the main game screen is occupied by a scrolling map of the level, with the bottom portion reserved for the control windows (one for the mini-map, other for game options like saving and restarting, a third for unit commands and a final one with unit information or a list of group formations). The player controls the soldiers by clicking on them and selecting orders icons from the command window:

- a fist icon is to attack;

- an upward arrow to select the route;

- a wrench to repair things;

- a shield to stand guard;

- a target to surround the unit.

The game has 65 levels spread on a variety of different terrains (garden, kitchen, etc).

Hackensack, an insane Texas billionaire bent on conquering the world, kidnaps professor Frobisher Goonhilly, a paranormal scientist working on a matter transformation weapon. As a demonstration of its powers, Arthur transforms the Isle of White into a giant custard slice, New York into a bath sponge and the Eiffel Tower into a toast rack. The ghost Blinky, secret agent for S.P.E.C.T.R.E. (Society for the Prevention of Ectoplasmic Crime, Telekinetic misuse and Reality Endangerment), infiltrates the madman's sea ship (the newly raised SS Titanic) armed with an ectoplasmic gun and a case full of disguises.

Titanic Blinky is a platform adventure and a clone of Dizzy, replacing the egg protagonist with a slightly effeminate ghost. As in that game, the aim is to collect objects (by pulling down on the movement controls) to solve puzzles. One main difference from Dizzy is the fact that Blinky carries a gun with infinite ammunition. There's an energy bar at the bottom of the screen that gets depleted every time Blinky touches an enemy. When it's empty, Blinky literally flips over and the player loses one life. The game starts with three lives, and there's no form of saving progress.

Now you must take control of the killer tomato Tommy Gun and fight your way through the five levels, defeat the aliens and rescue  your tomato friends that can be found imprisoned across the levels.

The gameplay of Tommy Gun is quite basic. It is a rail shooter with a third person perspective, where you take out your enemies one after the other scrolling from side to side. Each of the five levels have their unique setting and enemies. For example in the super market level you fight against vegetables and in the Paradise Island level you fight against crabs and pirate parrots, just to mention a few.

If you free the prisoners you'll get extra ammo, health packs, shields and other stuff that will help you stay alive a little longer. There is also a two player mode where the second player takes control of the sidekick Big Cheese.

The game is a top-down puzzler of sorts. An object manipulation mode is used to pick up and use objects when necessary. Extra milk (for energy) and fruit (for points) can be collected. Skateboarders must be avoided as they can take objects and randomly move them.

The members of your gang must all be gathered up on the first level and must be kept on your side by ensuring that your energy doesn't drop too low.</resource>

Your task is to race through 16 countries, each of which features four races, with many real-world circuits recreated in incongruous locations (such as the Monza layout in Ayers Rock, and the old Hockenheim in Vancouver). 

These four-race blocks each represent their own mini-championship, in which you race against 19 cars, needing to finish in the top 10 to continue, and with the top 6 scoring points 10-6-4-3-2-1, and the respective amount of money in thousands. This can be spent on various upgrades, ranging from engine to tires (wet and dry) and from shocks (front, side and rear) to gearboxes. The ideal approach is to buy the more expensive versions ASAP, as you get no saving when upgrading. If you win the four-race championship, you get the next password. 

You get a set amount of nitro boost to use during each race, although bonus nitros, money and instant speed-up token appear on many tracks. Hazards such as puddles, barriers and ramps are also frequent.

There are various enemies on the screen, which must be hit a number of times to be stopped. The ground-based creatures can then be walked over for points, while the birds simply stop for a few seconds. Your weapons have an arc similar to Kid Gloves, meaning that they hit the ground then rebound to a lower height, making precision aiming important. The level layouts are similar to Rodland, with gaps between platforms, and your character glides in a similar way - some of the disks are suspended in mid-air, and you must control the character's fall to pass over these - thankfully your character isn't harmed by falling. A number of bonus items are on offer, including extra points, extra lives and invincibility

Naturally, a dictator named General Akhboob took control of the beleagured nation and began creating an army of radioactive mutants. With a virtually impenetrable stronghold, a bunch of hostages, and a legion of mutants under his command, the evil despot will stop at nothing but world domination. Only two men have the courage and idealistic naivete to take on Akhboob and his forces: Captain Carnage and Major Mayhem, also known as the Doomsday Squad.

As Captain Carnage or Major Mayhem, it is up to you or you and a friend (in simultaneous action) to rescue the hostages while shooting hundreds of mutants bent on your destruction. As you walk and run forward, backward, left, right, and diagonally through 20 battlezones of nonstop action, you'll always have your machine gun by your side. Additional weapons which you can find along the way include grenade launchers, rocket launchers, plasma machine guns, flame throwers, spray-fire rifles, defensive blades, and an assortment of bombs.

Featuring a low-angle isometric view (not compensated by the d-pad, meaning pressing right will move the player along the half-way line (his right), not in the direction of the right corner flag (the screens' right) like in most games featuring axonometric views, while buttons allow to pass the ball in different strengths or kick at goal. Managing is limited to the choice of eight different formations at the start of the game and half-time.

Options include the usual in the genre: half length (3,5,10,20 and 45 minutes), weather conditions (sunny, rainy, overcast, indoors), referee strictness (full, no cards, no fouls), time stoppages, tie decision (shootout or overtime) and sound (music and sfx, only one of them or none).

But the evil demon Baalhathrok has taken them and so the player controls Treeac to retrieve them.

In an isometric view, Treeac has to conquer the seven floors of Baalhathrok's tower. The player controls a ball with his mouse and clicks where Treeac should go. Fights are initiated with left clicking on the enemy, for other actions the right mouse button has to be hold while choosing a symbol on the bottom of the screen. Besides of fighting the enemies the player has to open several doors - either by finding the key, pressing the right buttons in the right order or using one of his four lockpicks. When using the lockpicks the player has to beat a mini game where he has to make the correct mouse movements.  

When searching the rooms of the dungeon there are various potions, herbs and magical pieces of equipment to be found. With the herbs the player can mix potions or spells, which are available in four categories: Attacking, defending, transforming and item manipulation. There is no free save system, there are special save points during the game. Every time he wants to save the player has to sacrifice one piece of equipment.

Driving on gravel, asphalt and ice is involved, with each race made up of a series of short stages to complete. After each stage, your times are compared with those of your rivals, whose names are subtly changed from the real drivers of the day. Up to four human players can be involved, taking it in turns.

As visibility is sometimes low, and the exact curvature of a corner isn't always obvious from the apex, a co-driver is provided to give pace notes. These can be adjusted before you take to the track, specifying what is defined as 'hard left' and how early the warning should be given.

The steering sensitivity can be adjusted, and you can choose between automatic centering, and a push-the-opposite-way-to-centre mode, but more unusual is the option to race with the steering directions reversed - definitely one for advanced players.

Quite humorous graphics can draw you into the game. An average use of colour, but the backdrops are pretty bland. Couple this with lots going on, and you get a very confusing play. Also some good music, with a good variety of sound effects during the game. Overall, they add to the humour of the graphics quite well. The basic idea is pretty good, and fighting the various monsters is quite fun, but once you've seen most of the screens and baddies the game loses its addictiveness and appeal. As far as platform games go, Toyottes isn't that great and not really something I can recommend.</resource>

As a contestant, the player's mission is to be the first to ever complete it successfully. The task involves commanding a fleet of Skimmers charged with destroying various groups of combat vehicles, including Cycloids, Scouts and Defenders. Short and long-range scanners are available to aid in this.

The game takes place in a maze world containing a number of distinct sectors, each of which has its own type of enemy present. The Communication Centre powers the Cycloids, and are protected by the Defenders. Once these are taken out, the Centerpoint Sector must be destroyed to complete the level.

Could they be to blame for the disappearance of the sun and the resultant ice age? As a train captain, you must find out and overthrow them.

Transarctica is a strategic trading and combat game, rather like Elite in many ways. You must keep your train running, and make sure there is enough fuel. When you reach towns you can trade with local people, with each city having a primary function. These towns often contain useful information to put you on the right track in your mission. You are in possession of slaves, who are traded just like other commodities.

Contact with other trains results in combat. Buy upgrades to boost your performance in combat, to increase your chance of fending off the Viking Union.

Besides the rocks, there are lots of spaceships, many of which shoot at the player, and some which are clearly ‘inspired’ by the designs in Star Wars. All of these must be cleared to complete the level.

The player starts the game with 3 very basic ships, having no firepower, flexibility or shield upgrades. On each level, money can be collected, which can be spent on these items. Every item can be upgraded through five levels, although these are increasingly expensive. There is no points system however.

Rather innovatively, the game hands out passwords after each game so the player can continue at the start of the level on which the last life was lost. This means that if more than one life was lost on the same level, all of them will be back, and also any purchased power-up is taken back and the money returned (allowing the player to make new decisions).

Play with perfectly spherical stones of crystallized, colored gems on a hexagon-shaped field, formed by beams of pure-white light from diamond powered laser-beams.
Place your gemstones at the intersections of light. When three of your stones are correctly positioned, the stones resonate with the laser-light to form ideal triangles of shimmering color that control territory and capture your opponent's stones.
Play until your opponent cannot move and you win!
Play TrianGo against a friend or the computer. But beware, for instilled in the computer is the knowledge of Ancient Masters.

(Also known as 'Og') was the second game Dave Parsons of Confused Pelican wrote for the Amiga. It was a fairly short, sideways-scrolling game in the Wonderboy style. It used pixel-perfect collision detection routines and ran in 32-colour mode. He revisited it later and made a much more colourful AGA version which had 64 colours, much smoother sky colours and screen fades, and a 1-bit parallax background layer. Outside of the game itself, it's really not very polished, and has pretty awful music.</resource>

You play a Troll roaming the levels in the hope of rescuing as many baby trolls as possible - each level gives you a set minimum to retrieve before you can leave via the Pigstop.

Initially you have no weapons, and contact with the nasties costs you energy, but a Yo-Yo can be collected, which can be used not only to kill enemies, but also to smash blocks away and open up paths, and even (with practice) tied to a ledge to allow you to swing across a gap. 

Throughout the levels you will find the letters B,O,N,U,S and G released from bonus balloons or on killing an enemy - if at the end of a level your letters spell out Bonus or Bogus you go to the appropriate extra level. The former has a chance to gain extra lives, the latter must be escaped quickly to avoid losing a life.

Last month, there was us thinking that Flair's Dangerous Streets had to be the last word in awesomely awful beat 'em-ups but no! Ã¢â‚¬â€ here comes Tube Warriors all set to make us rethink just how bad games can get. The big pity with Tube Warriors is that the basic engine for an excellent Street Fighter 2 clone Ã¢â‚¬â€ or even a perfect conversion of the coin-op itself Ã¢â‚¬â€ is in place. Trouble is, it's obvious that having written it the programmers have no idea what to do with it. The backdrops, for example, move as nicely as any in Street Fighter, with loads of top foreground and background parallax effects, but they're just so drab and unexciting to look at. Likewise, the fighters are poorly drawn (something of an understatement, to be honest) and stiffly animated, but they bounce around swiftly enough. Now I could live with ropey graphics if the gameplay was any good but, to be blunt, it's a mess. The joystick control is sheer crap; if you simply want to walk left and right you have to make the character take each step by tapping the joystick in the required direction, so you can imagine what a nightmare the combat moves are to pull off. There are many other things I could go on about Ã¢â‚¬â€ the crude presentation, the fact that you can't choose your character in one player mode, the duff sound Ã¢â‚¬â€ but I think you get the idea. I took this home to review over the weekend and even my girlfriend, who still thinks Space Invaders is advanced computer entertainment, recognised it as crap. Stay well away for fear of contamination.</resource>

    <resource id="83d93a6d6758c7ae58dd71d40895d56e4b5bf7c3" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">One of the most popular game genres in the late 80' and the early 90's so a bit unusual to see this kind of game made in 1994. Tubular Worlds doesn't offer anything new and in my opinion it looks like Dongleware was a bit too late with getting this game published since they missed the general game market with a few years.

Apart from that Tubular Worlds is a well developed game offering the usual side scroller interface where the entire goal in the game is to shoot up as many enemies as possible. The more you shoot the better your spaceship gets. You can get better weapons, faster movement and other great improvements. The game consists of many different enemies and also multiple levels so there are many hours of game play.

Overall a nice side scroller but both the graphics and sound could have been better considering the age of this game. Of course this is not the most important in a game and the developers have programmed with this on their mind.</resource>

Contact can cause the car to spin, slow down or even flip; in each case you will lose time.

There are 16 stages set across the US, gradually moving from east to west, all depicted differently visually. After every 4 levels, you go into a shop screen, with a choice of upgrades. As the title implies, you now have a turbo booster installed, which speeds up the car, although over-use can cause the engine to overheat, and it is not recharged until each shop section. You have 5 continues, and failure to complete the course within the time limit costs you one.</resource>

You have? Well this is just the thing for you! Turbo Trax is a slot racing system incorporating all the features of a standard layout Ã¢â‚¬â€œ including crossovers, chicanes and even a pit stop Ã¢â‚¬â€œ without the hassle of causing severe damage to anything else. Good, eh?

Once the options have been set, moving to the OK icon exits the menu and moves to the track. The race is seen as a plan view on a split or single screen Ã¢â‚¬â€œ depending on the selections made. The cars (or car if you're playing a time trial) sit on the grid with their engines running, until the green light appears and they're off!

You steer by pointing the joystick in the direction of the track (except on curves) and get a burst of speed by pressing the fire button. Zooming too fast into crossovers or chicanes will turn you over and cause damage, as will riding fast over rough track. However, repairs and refueling can be carried out by stopping in the red and white zone of the pits. Unfortunately, a crash involving both cars on a crossover causes the race to be abandoned.</resource>

The aim is to wipe out the enemy, which has gathered around the allied airspace of 'Area 88', in a series of military aircraft-based scenarios.
 You choose one of three unique pilots; Shin Kazama, Micky Schymon or Greg Gates, each with varying abilities at damage repair, weapon handling and flying skill, and engage the enemy over a series of challenging missions. The player starts out with the weakest plane, the F8E Crusader, which can only be armed with a very basic range weapons. But, through completing various missions, enough cash can be raised to purchase higher-quality aircraft. These superior planes are more agile, have improved resilience to damage and have a greater range of fire. Furthermore, the more advanced fighters can be armed with superior special weapons, such as napalm.
 The missions include attacks on sand bases, the nuclear submarine 'Seavet' and enemy supply camps, as well as seeing off groups of airborne 'bandits' who swarm-in on Area 88.
 The enemy is plentiful, and the pace is frantic. Shoot at everything on the screen that moves, and the allied forces might just come out on top......

It also had large, detailed towns with many people to talk to, and a separate combat engine where your party fought multiple monsters in a turn-based tile-based system.
After the defeat of the evil wizard Mondain and his mistress Minax in the previous two Ultimas, peace has returned to the land of Sorsaria. Times passes and eventually geological disruptions and a resurgence of the monster populace occur, and it is soon learned that Mondain and Minax had conceived a child named &amp;quot;Exodus&amp;quot; before their death. Now that child has become an adult with the power to avenge the death of his parents. Obviously, it falls upon you the hero to find and stop him.</resource>

However, the main difference between Ultima IV and its predecessors in the series (as well as other role-playing games) lies in the game's objectives and the ways to fulfill them. Instead of building up a character by any means possible in order to face a villain in the end of the game, in Ultima IV the player is trying to become the Avatar, a role model for people. This means upholding the Eight Virtues, basically trying to become a better person. Making morally conscious decisions and helping other people is not done expecting a material reward, but because it is the actual goal of the game and the main focus of its gameplay. The game frowns on behavior typical of most other RPGs, such as backstabbing fleeing enemies or picking up everything that isn't nailed down even if it does not belong to the protagonist. This different approach established the game's reputation as the first &amp;quot;true&amp;quot; Ultima, influencing the design philosophy of later installments and the overall spirit of the series.</resource>

In Britannia Castle, the Avatar learns that his captors were gargoyles, a race of enigmatic creatures that have recently invaded Britannia and occupied the shrines of Virtue. The Avatar embarks on a quest to free Britannia.
Ultima VI is unique in that it is an entirely continuous world. There is no &amp;quot;world map&amp;quot; in the game, all locations are connected to each other turning the game world into an open environment. Compared to previous installments in the series, the game focuses more on quests and exploration than on combat.</resource>

However, there is no naval element whatsoever and the design pays little attention to extremely important wargaming concepts like fog of war.

Your characters move about in much the same way as their counterparts in Breach, Omnitrend's tactical combat RPG.

You set out to escort a diplomat on a trip to the hyperspace booster (a key element of Universe 2) to investigate the disappearance of shipments from Earth to this remote corner of the star map. The story takes a quick twist when you and your crew are captured, forcing you to rack up some criminal charges during your escape. You'll spend the rest of your time looking for evidence about the missing shipments, which will clear you of the charges as well as wrap up the mystery.

Unreal is a magical world where you must save Princess Isolde, your true love, from the evil Polymorphic, the Master of Darkness.

Unreal is made up of 8 levels and contains a mixture of 2D and 3D graphics.  The environment is also completely interactive - you can run up and down hills and slide through the snow but you have to be careful to not fall of the top of a cliff.

On each level you will be faced with puzzles and battles and you need to get the high score you pass to the next level.  If your health reaches zero you will die and the game is over.  Fortunately, your health is replenished at the end of each level.

You are sent out to take out half a dozen enemy battle groups, each consisting of four huge spaceships. Similar to the first Uridium, you face increasing numbers of unfriendly fighter wings and stationary defenses while sweeping over the carriers. The real challenge here is to avoid the many walls on the back of the vessel while you are under attack.
After the exterior has been cleaned from most of the enemy presence you take care of the ships' reactor core in a jump-and-run-like sequence. While floating in a non-gravity surrounding, lower the core's shields and then destroy it.
The game also gives you a number of extra weapons that can be collected by either flying over pick-ups left from dead enemy wings or by catching them after the power generator has been destroyed.

The field of battle is a toroidal grid on which your tri-colored half-sphere base cells sit awaiting your protection.  The invading cells (also tri-colored spheres) attempt to bond together into groups and destroy your bases.  You destroy the infecting cells by lobbing antibodies (also tri-colored spheres) at them.  Hit an infector with the right color shot and it is destroyed.  The catch is that you have a limited amount of each color of ammunition.  Run out of a color and the game is over.  The situation is also complicated by Spitters, enemies that appear and spew out new attacking cells if you take too long to complete a level.

    <resource id="b606f3acb480e81e7180c3cdc2be6d654b851efd" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">This one on one future sport combines ideas from a number of real-world competitions, most notably the schoolgirl favourite Netball (I wonder why the ad blurb makes no mention of this?). The action is viewed isometrically, so moving the joystick up moves your droid north-east, down moves south-west, and so on.

The aim is to score more points than your opponent in each match, and be the first to win four matches (against either a human or computer opponent), before moving up to the next difficulty level. There is a goal in the middle at each end, and the ball can be advanced by shooting it (the length of a shot is affected by pushing the joystick up or down with fire pressed) as you can't run with the ball, or hold onto it for long. The main novel idea in the game is the shaping of the pitches, which are viewed in full 3D and have bumps and big divots all around.

    <resource id="b3f173ce41e931416cac9ec0084511ace5b1c89e" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">All centers around Walther von Grünschild, a rich merchant and patron of the arts from Berlin, whose art collection was stolen. Now he sends his four nephews into the world to regain his paintings. The most successful of them becomes his heir. The game starts in 1918 and ends when von Grünschild dies. One round equals one day. The length of a round can be chosen between five seconds and infinite.

In auctions the missing pictures are sold from time to time. But to buy them the player obviously needs money. This is gained by opening up to 24 plantations in the Third World. There the player either grows coffee, cacao, tea or tobacco. After the harvesting the goods get shipped to warehouses in New York or London where the player sells it to interested companies. The player has to be on-site for every action which means an important part of the game is to plan ahead where he has to go during the next days. Another way to win money is gambling at horse races.

Besides his business the player can visit art schools to gain the ability to distinguish real paintings from fake ones. This is useful during the auctions because it is annoying to buy a forgery. Another way is to hire a middleman to attend anonymous to the auctions. This way the other players don't know he tries to buy a certain painting and it gets cheaper. Of course the middleman can't profit from the player's expertise and is more likely to buy a forgery. In Chicago the player can hire robbers to steal paintings from his competitors.

There are 3 sub-levels on each station, which can be played in any order. The action scrolls in every direction, with you guiding your tank-link droid around to shoot the opposition droids. The tank takes a while to steer, making it initially harder to avoid contact with those enemies. Each level contains energy stars, which can be traded in for upgrades such as improved weapons and extra speed after each level.

You fly a plane through inhospitable landscapes full of enemy fighters and gun turrets. Most of the planes come at you in formation, firing easily-visible orange bullets at you, and can be either shot or avoided. The turrets are capable of rotating in 8 directions and aiming at you as best they can, so be careful to dodge their bullets. 

There are also larger vehicles which fly down the screen in a direct vertical line. The helicopters hold power-ups including extra weapons (which you only get for a limited number of shots; this is the one time where holding down fire constantly (on an auto fire joystick) isn't hugely beneficial), speed-ups and energy recharge (once your vehicle's damage reaches 100%, you lose that one of your 5 lives). The planes are huge and fire a constant volley at you, but offer a huge 5,000 points if taken down. At the end of each level an even bigger plane comes at you, weaving from left to right while gradually moving down the screen (and eventually out of the bottom of the screen and back through the top).

In this particular one, you have to control a small paint gun that contains five different colored paints, and destroy blocks that are falling toward you by making them all the same color. Your paint gun is on a roller at the bottom of the screen, and horizontal strips of colored blocks fall from the top of the screen at varying speeds. Holding down the fire button and pushing left or right changes the currently selected color, and sometimes you only just have enough time to get the right color before the blocks smash into you. As the blocks fall at varying speeds, there are times when an avalanche is set off by a slow block being hit by a fast moving block above it. This is a game that gets very, very frantic.

    <resource id="aeb0ffab6c75a26d9e45bf658a27e7233e11c075" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Volfied is a home conversion of an arcade coin-op developed by Taito in the late '80s. The game is very similar to Qix -- the player takes control of an object whose purpose is to roam the screen, forming shapes and removing them from the play field. By way of reward, a picture is gradually revealed in the removed areas of the screen. The borders of the area which the player has not cleared become the border of the area the player's pointer can move along.

The player's object must avoid contact with any of the enemies which float around the screen, as this will weaken and eventually destroy it. Barriers limit which parts of the border boxes can be formed through. The goal is to clear 80% or more of the screen, and each additional percent adds bonus points.

As an arcade conversion this game allows for one or two player games in three difficulty levels, but offers no passwords or saved games across its numerous levels.

However, it was later found by the people of Roxiz, who locate Earth and decide to invade it, by establishing bases on each of Saturn's 10 moons. As former POW Luke Snayles, you must destroy each of these fleets of 80 aliens, before they can be dispatched.

Voyager is viewed from on board the craft, and is a first person shoot 'em up using polygon graphics. You start with a laser and a few bombs, but can collect extra weaponry and the ability to fly through the mothership. Not all enemies can be killed simply by shooting them, so there is a tactical element to the slaughter.

From the time of Vasco da Gama and Columbus (the late 1400s) to the French Revolution (1789), you are put in charge of a nation's imperial destiny.  This means financing voyages, assembling crews, sending out land and sea expeditions, founding colonies, and occasionally engaging other European powers for global dominance.

Exploration may seem familiar to players of Civilization, Colonization, Conquest of the New World, Gold of the Americas, and even Sid Meier's Pirates!, as they borrow from exploration and cover a similar topic. </resource>

The main options screen allows you to select manual or automatic transmission, number of laps, and training, single race, or full season. The multiplayer option allows two players to race against each other on separate computers.

Each track, with different layouts and background graphics, includes many tight curves, steep grades and inclines, as well as tunnels and a pit stop.

The player-controlled car has working side-view mirrors, which allow you to view the actual action behind you, as well as a working speedometer and gear display.

The game features a colorful mix of 3D and 2D graphics, realistic sound effects, and blazing fast, smooth animations.

Hulk Hogan, The Ultimate Warrior or the British Bulldog can come under your control.

You play either in practice matches (against the hopefully-misnamed Mr Perfect) or in a sequence of 5 matches to win the Wrestlemania Belt. Your opponents have different special moves - watch out for The Warlord's Full Nelson and Sgt. Slaughter's Camel Clutch, for example. Before the fights start, your opponents will deliver a taunt, which you must respond to as creatively as possible.

The game is a beat 'em up viewed from a forced perspective above and behind the action. Your aim is to pin your opponent to the ground for 3 seconds, which can only be done once he has been weakened. Kicks, punches and throws will reduce an opponent's strength bar. When a strong opponent is down, stamping on him will pay off more than attempting a pin.

Avoid leaving the ring for too long - 20 seconds out and the match is void, which counts as a defeat. As in real WWF, the frame of the arena can be used to perform moves. Once players are in close contact, waggle the joystick to ensure you win the grapple.

The board is divided into 20 shapes around the edge, each of which has a value from 1 to 20 points, a special double area around the edge and a special treble area in the middle (each of which multiply the shot score). There is also a bullseye right in the middle for 50 points and an outer bull around it, worth 25 points. Players always take three shots at a time. In the 501 game the aim is to reduce the score from 501 to 0, finishing with a double or the bull. If the score reaches 1 or a negative number, any shots in that set of 3 are cancelled out. In Round The Board, the player must hit each target in turn starting with 20, but moving back 2 or 3 for a double or treble, eventually finishing with Double Top. Both of these games are recreated in this simulation. The movement of the cursor you use to aim is slightly skiddy, to recreate natural jitters (or, as some would cynically suggest, the effects of being as drunk as most darts players). Wacky Darts lives up to its name by featuring an assortment of human, alien, and machine opponents of varying difficulties. Each of them has a short profile, and use a different object to hit the board.</resource>

Tolkien's War in Middle Earth is the 16-bit game with additional adventuring features compared to the 8-bit version, loosely depicting the events of the One Ring from the Shire to Mt. Doom. The game starts with the three hobbits: Frodo, Sam, and Pippin surrounded by nine individual units of Nazgul near the Shire. Although the first task is to travel to Rivendell, the player is free to decide how heroes and armies progress, despite the in-game conventional storyline. Victory is attained by successfully sending the ring bearer to Mt. Doom - how this accomplished is completely up to the player. Additionally, any hero including Frodo may die during combat. If the ring bearer dies during combat, a new ring bearer (if they survive the encounter) will be appointed to carry the One Ring. If the enemy gains possession of the One Ring is taken by the enemy, they will attempt to reach Barad-Dur, Sauron's fortress in the heart of Mordor, which will result in the player's defeat. The player will also lose if the enemy manages to seize three major allied citadels.</resource>

The setting involves a mysterious race of beings attacking humanity for an unknown reason, and the FOE-57 Spacecraft being humanity’s only hope.

Once you’re into space, the craft is directed using the mouse. The keyboard controls offer autopilot modes, multiple weapons including Mines and Stinger missiles, an HUD display, multiple viewpoints, targeting and navigation, all of which must be used as appropriate. The menus feature some cinematic-feeling link screens, and some moody music.

This may be played between up to 8 people all on the same machine. It is a medieval type strategy game that requires the player to control 80 cities in the realm of Illuria. In order to do so you must wipe out your 7 opponents. 

Gold is accrued through the ownership of cities. The gold is then used to create armies. Heroes can sometimes &amp;quot;find&amp;quot; things or be rewarded by sages (there are only 2 and it's a first come first served basis). You can choose between various human and non-human peoples, as well as the ubiquitous evil Warlord. This is a very early version of what strategy games eventually became.

    <resource id="beefc099ecadb0d0ea3c7e170c973c5b05eef587" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Waterloo, arguably the most famous battle in history, was fought on June 18, 1815 between the French Forces of the Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte and the English and combined Allied forces under the Duke of Wellington and Prussian forces under Field Marshall Blucher.

Waterloo the game was a revolutionary new concept in wargaming when it was published in 1989. Waterloo dispensed with the normal overview given to wargame commanders and instead gave a player the same point of view as real commanders on the field of battle.

Your orders in an age of pre-radio communication must pass through an elaborate chain of command with varying levels of success in the execution of those orders. Your orders may even be ignored if there is better local intelligence or your officers lack the skill or courage to perform them. You as the commander (Napoleon or Wellington) must even deal with a time delay in the occurrence in events and the time it takes for those events to be relayed back to HQ and the time it takes to issue orders and see those orders carried out. A text parser is used to issue orders during the game. The battle ends at 9:30 pm at which time full battle reports will become available and the results assessed. You are also given the option to review the battlefield.The game is solitaire only and the playing time is 10-20 hours.

Through a range of murals at your uncle's house, various past scenes must be entered, with more becoming available as you complete them. In each you must find and kill your demented relative in time. The game's controls are point and click, with the interface allowing you to examine and collect objects, select a weapon, and attack potential foes by striking at a particular part of their body.

It has the same gameplay concept as Tetris; simply all the player has to do is to rotate and maneuver the falling pieces into a proper position in order to form complete layers in the rectangular playground. But Welltris changes this rectangular arena into a four sided well with grid-like walls and bottom where the falling pieces can be moved from wall to wall within the well. Form the pieces into solid rows either horizontally or vertically on the bottom of the well.

Billed itself as Tetris in three dimensions.</resource>

It was originally published by Broderbund in 1988 for Apple I , Commodore 64 and MS-DOS , and ported to the Apple IIGS , Amiga and Macintosh in 1989. It is the third Carmen Sandiego title, after world-based Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego? (1985) and US-based Where in the USA Is Carmen Sandiego? (1986). Under the guidance of The Acme Agency's chief, the player completes cases to catch Carmen's henchmen; they accomplish this by traveling to European locations to investigate clues relating to the crook's last known whereabouts, and by gaining enough character data to issue a warrant of arrest. Once the player has captured all 15 thieves, they are able to chase after Carmen herself.</resource>

    <resource id="90fdb175752366cdf62cbac4a69e730325ce2e63" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">The gameplay is similar to that of its predecessor, Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego?. The goal of the game is to track Carmen's henchmen across the United States, arrest them, and ultimately arrest Carmen Sandiego, who has escaped from a European prison and has gone to the US to assemble a gang of V.I.L.E. members to steal the country's treasures.

The player, an agent of ACME Detective Agency, must gather information on the suspect and use it to obtain a warrant to reduce the potential suspects to one of the V.I.L.E. members in the database. The player must then track the criminal to the final destination and make an arrest. The player advances in rank throughout the game, eventually reaching the level of Super Sleuth. The player captures 16 of Carmen's crooks before having a chance to arrest her.

The main screen interface is divided into four sections showing the day, time, and location; textual information, an image from the current city, and the available actions. The game was supplied with a special copy of Fodor's USA encyclopedia as a reference guide and a travel guide book.  The deluxe version of the game includes more than 50 digitized photographs, numerous state topographical maps, digitized sounds, and music.</resource>

This organization specializes in stealing the world's treasures without a trace. Alarmed by this, the A.C.M.E. Detective Agency makes it their personal mission to foil Carmen Sandiego's plans.

Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego? is a game that tests the player's knowledge about geography and general knowledge about different countries. Missions will begin with a treasure being stolen and the player flying to that location. A time limit counts down while they must search the area and interview witnesses to find enough clues to figure out what country the thief flew to next. The player always has a limited selection (usually three or four) of flights available in any given country. This process is repeated until either the villain is found or time expires and they are able to get away.</resource>

The controls reflect this, with moving the controller to the right actually moving the character down and right, moving it down and right moving the character down directly, and so on. Each level is played out against a time limit, and the paths through the level aren’t always clear-cut. There are four different types of doors, each of which needs a particular icon to pass (the icons represent the door type, such as ice or bricks, rather than hot water or a key, or anything you’d logically expect to clear the path). You can avoid the baddies, which may be the best option, as killing them costs you some energy –this reduces the significance of the points system.

In one player mode you can play a Wild Cup or a League system; two player games are restricted to single Ã¢â‚¬ËœUnfriendlyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ matches.

Unlike its predecessor the game uses an isometric viewpoint, perhaps because the original FIFA was so popular at the time. A number of vicious moves are on offer, with tackles Vinnie Jones would flinch at along with lethal head-butts and shoulder barges. If a game finishes drawn, it goes into a Ã¢â‚¬ËœPenalty Shoot OutÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, which involves going round shooting the opposition;Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the last team standing wins. The pre-match screens include attacking at defensive play styles, transfers and the chance to buy items such as rocket launchers and shields.</resource>

Hostile persons including thieves, guards and assassins will be encountered; you fight them in real time using moves such as cartwheels and flying kicks. This can be played either as a continuous battle, or with short breaks to catch your composure.

The role-playing elements eschew the Ultima-style plan view in favor of a pseudo-3D system. Deism and Shamanism are just some of the included magic disciplines. Magical vehicles help you get around the 100 landscapes more quickly, although you spend much time on foot. The game takes place in a fully active universe of characters such as villagers and giant beetles, all getting about their business within a day/night cycle and variable weather.

You're a 2nd Lieutenant just out of the Academy, with some good work under your belt. You're posted to Tiger's Claw, the flagship of the Confederation Fleet.  Will you help the Confederation to victory, or go down in infamy? 

Wing Commander is a space combat simulator interspersed with shipboard dialogs. Onboard the ship, you can save/load game, visit the bar to get the latest gossip, or go on to the next mission briefing, and the 3D space combat part. 

The 3D space combat have you sitting in the cockpit, where you control the craft like roll, turn, up/down, afterburner, as well as fire guns and launch missiles. There are four different crafts on the Confed side, each with different flight characteristics and armament. You will have a wingman on each mission, and you should keep the wingman alive as the wingman will help you if you issue the right orders. You can also taunt the enemy. You'll be fighting several different types of enemy fighters and capital ships, and even combat a few Kilrathi aces. 

When the mission is complete, land back onboard the ship and get ready for the next one. The campaign tree have both winning and losing paths. 

Wing Commander featured a hybrid bitmap/3D graphics  engine that allowed even 286's to display detailed 3D graphics to an extent never before possible. With EMS available, it can display even more detailed graphics and in-cockpit animations.

The missions usually come in three flavors: Top-down view bombing missions where you have to take out strategically important targets, isometric strafing runs where you get to blast anything that you fancy blasting with an unlimited supply of ammo, and of course the main part: Dogfights in the sky. Rendered in 3D, seems from behind your head.

The game is set in the years 1916 through 1918, and to loosen things up a little, we get to read a page of our character's new entry for the diary-like journal in his company between every mission.

You start out as a small insect, flying through a deranged castle filled with hostile animals and monsters.

The upgrade system is rich, and differs somewhat from genre conventions. As you upgrade, your insect turns into a more powerful bat or a mighty dragon. Shooting enemies reveals the various upgrades, and picking up several upgrades of the same kind upgrades that particular weapon level after level. Enemies may also release anti-powerups, marked by a skull. These will downgrade your weapon or draw your energy level.

After fighting the end boss of the castle, a three-headed dragon, you move onto a jungle, a swamp and further... That is, if you survive. Wings of Death has an unparalleled number of bullets and enemy objects on-screen for its time and platform, the maximum number being reported as 95. Coded by former demo programmers, the game also runs in full 50 or 60 Hz scrolling while playing digitised music even on an Atari ST, thanks to inventive hardware tricks used in few other commercial games. It also utilises the extra colour palettes of the Atari STe.

Maximus Mouse is now a rescue ranger at Camp Nice'n'Icy, but he soon notices a bird who will knock a pebble down a mountain, setting off a avalanche that will engulf the camp, unless he can prevent it, over eight varied levels.

The levels offer various challenges. The most common type of level is a patrol. There are three such levels, involving ice skating, boating on a river, and skiing. On each level you have a quota of rescues to make. There are various obstacles on the levels, and a variety of objects to use to avoid them. For example, a spring will allow you to jump over a stretch of water.

At the end of each of these levels is a boss, who must be defeated using the objects you have collected. The bosses are easier to defeat the more rescues you perform.

Other levels include a skate training level, a snowball fight with bears hiding in trees, and a memory game with a cameo appearance by Clyde Radcliffe from the Creatures series. Most of the levels have a time limit, indicated by the bird moving towards the pebble.</resource>

It is very similar to offerings like Winter Games from Epyx.

In Downhill skiing, you must avoid the obstacles and make it to the bottom of the hill, by swerving left and right and adjusting your speed by pushing the joystick forward and back. The Slalom is similar, involving skiing around flags.

In the ski jump, you must position the skis for a proper landing. In the bobsled event, you must carefully control the angles so your bobsled doesn't flip. The Biathlon event combines skiing to shooting ranges and shooting the targets archery-style.</resource>

Once the word has been spelled, the newly found wabbits leave fruit, stars, and clocks that increase the time limit. The time limit can also be extended by picking up a glowing orange orb which appears during the last ten seconds of the counter, adding thirty seconds to it.</resource>

    <resource id="02d2e2d8b5e0324c8cbf6df4661bf5a74006eee6" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">It is said the the Cosmic Forge is a magical pen possessing an enormous power: whatever is written with it instantly becomes true. A group of explorers ventures into the castle that where the king, the queen, and the wizard who created the pen used to dwell. Nobody knows what has been happening there for the last hundred years, since nobody dares to enter the haunted castle. As the heroes step in, the doors behind them close forever. They are left alone to discover the truth about the Cosmic Forge and the drama that occurred between the castle's inhabitants.

Bane of the Cosmic Forge is the sixth entry in the Wizardry series. While retaining the basic premise of creating a party of up to six adventurers to roam first-person dungeons and fight enemies in turn-based combat, this installment contains numerous enhancements and new features. It is the first game in the series to feature full color graphics and a mouse-driven interface. Combat options are more detailed, with precise weapon moves (such as thrust and bash) available. Magic is divided into six different schools, the spellcaster's powers increasing if he or she concentrates on one of them. Picking locks or disarming traps by thief-like classes is done actively by participating in a simple minigame. Characters can learn skills unique to their class when leveling up. These skills range from weapon proficiencies to field abilities that can be used outside of combat.

In addition to the traditional races of humans, elves, dwarves, hobbits, and gnomes, the player can choose between the Lizardman, the cat-like Felpurr, the canine Rawulf, the pixie-like Faerie, the intimidating Dracon, and the furry Mook. Each race has its own strengths and weaknesses, as well as predispositions to certain classes. Exotic character classes such as Valkyrie, Alchemist, Psionic, Ninja, Samurai, and Monk are also available during character creation, though they require a higher amount of bonus points received during the initial dice roll. It is also possible for characters to switch to another class during the course of the game.

Conversations with NPCs have been extended, the player being able to talk about various topics with the same character. The game also features a branching storyline: depending on the player's choice to believe or mistrust a key character, the plot will split into different directions, resulting in several different endings. The entire game takes place within the castle and its surroundings, without the possibility to travel back to the town or create other characters after the game has started. Unlike the previous entries, it is possible to save the game anywhere manually.</resource>

Word of Tom-Tom's dangerous adventure soon spread throughout Wonder Land. The people were very proud of him and gave Tom-Tom the highest honor of all - the legendary name of Wonder Boy. With the evil King defeated, Wonder Land returned to its peaceful state, and for over one decade, the kingdom was a paradise, and everything and everyone lived happily together.

Eventually, the peace was broken when a ferocious fire-breathing dragon appeared out of nowhere and took over Wonder Land with an army of evil, monsterous henchmen, causing Wonder Land was immediately thrown into utter chaos. Defenseless that they were, the people were quickly taken over and the tranquil and serene kingdom was transformed into a land of demons and devils. Wonder Land was now a Monster Land. Tom-Tom was summoned to set out on a journey, destroy this dragon, and restore peace once again. Tom-Tom is Wonder Land's last hope.

There are twelve locations in which Tom-Tom must venture through, including (but not limited to): the city of Wonder Land, Valley of Peace, The Coastal Town of Baraboro, The Mam Desert, and Pororo Islands. During his journey, he must defeat monsters with the sword that he got at the beginning of his adventure. These monsters will leave either gold coins or bags of cash, which he can use to buy better weapons, shields, armors, and boots. At the end of each location, there is usually a boss that Tom-Tom must defeat in order to obtain a gold key that will unlock the exit gate, as well as plenty of gold coins or bags of cash. If he touches any enemies, or is shot at, he will lose health. During his travels, Tom-Tom must take note of the hourglass; if the hourglass display sands at the bottom, he must get another one that appears out of nowhere, or he'll also lose health. There are two ways in which he can restore it. He can either go into bars to have a drink that will restore it and get a hint about what lies ahead as well, or go into hospitals and heal himself to restore the lost health.</resource>

Wonderland is based on Lewis Carroll's classic children's book Alice in Wonderland, with the player taking on the role of Alice. It does not involve anything from that book's sequel, Through the Looking-Glass.

With this game, Magnetic Scrolls introduced a bespoke windowing system dubbed &amp;quot;Magnetic Windows&amp;quot;. The player's inventory, the location's graphic, the map and so on are all in separate windows that can be moved and resized independently.[2] (A similar system is used in unrelated adventure games like Deja Vu.) The developers stated they believed it would make the game more accessible, giving it a much wider appeal.</resource>

Training the boxers involves deciding which areas they should work on, considering their strengths and weaknesses and any damage inflicted in previous fights, and those of their next opponent. There are 97 of these in the game, so reaching the top of the rankings will take about 15-20 fights. Choosing a beatable opponent who can get the fight as high up the Friday Night bill as possible, as well as negotiating the best financial deal and a mutually agreeable dare, are the main considerations.</resource>

    <resource id="bd3768023ec01af9409c8a93706cc852c4988ce4" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Worms is a turn-based strategy game. It features up to 4 teams of 4 worms, aiming to destroy the others on a generated terrain. Each worm has 100 hit points, and dies when his hit points fall to 0. Upon death, a worm explodes, causing damage to everyone around.

Gameplay is turn-based. Each turn, the player can control one specific worm from his team. The worm can crawl left and right or jump. However, there is a time limit to make a move; also, if the worm falls from a great height, it loses health and the turn ends immediately; and if a worm falls into water or offscreen, it dies. Each turn, a worm can also make a single attack: the player can aim up and down, choose a weapon and then fire it. After attacking, the turn ends. 

There's a lot of weapons available - the standard ones as bazookas (which is affected by the (random) wind settings and gravity) and grenades. The others include a Fire Punch, dynamite, air strikes, and utilities such as ropes and girders.

There are 10 styles of terrain, ranging from forests and deserts to Candy land and the moon (complete with affected gravity). Shots leave craters in the ground, and complex tunnels can be formed.

Like its predecessor, it is a turn-based artillery game. The game format remains the same: players control small armies of four Worms (whose names can be altered) with the sole purpose of blowing up all the other Worms on the map. Players can compete either against computer-controlled Worms or against each other. 

The weapons are more extensive (and destructive) than in the previous game, including the first appearances of the Kenny-on-a-Rope, Concrete Donkey, Priceless Ming Vase, Old Woman and Holy Hand Grenade. Also included is a level editor that allows players to create their own battlefields.</resource>

    <resource id="0866723a42471fd801518b047491943f47be1ea0" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Wreckers is an isometric sci-fi action game with strategy elements.

Robotic droids roll quietly through the corridors of space station Beacon 04523N, automated computers calculate routes for interstellar traffic. Three human officers sleep in cryogenic tanks, awakened only for routine system checks – or in case of an emergency. With a hum, the cryogenic control springs on-line as Beacon’s long-range sensors detect incoming lifeforms.

Controlling one of the on-board officers, you have to defend the station against swarms of plasmodian spores (the “Wreckers”) showering down on Beacon and seeping into its four sections. While the spores approach, you can suck them out of space with a gigantic hoover-like space hose. Once they settle onto the stations hull, jump into the space suit and spray infected areas with a cleansing agent. Undetected spores will seep into the station’s corridors, where you must hunt them down with a plasma shots and avoid being shot in return.

In addition, up to ten droids are under your (indirect) control. Ranging from cleaners to fighters to engineers, these automatons will act independently, but can be sent to key locations within the station -- i.e. infected areas. As your officer gains experience through battles, he will be promoted to higher ranks, enabling him to construct more efficient fighter robots in the station’s droid factory.

Since plasmodians running rampant in the station will cause system malfunctions, your main goal is to clear infections quickly and make sure that Beacon continues to function properly. To make things worse, an self-destruct mechanism will explode the station in 60 minutes unless all signs of spore activity cease. 

Effective droid construction and assignment, quick reactions to approaching swarms and good reflexes thus combine into a challenging race against time that makes Wreckers stand out as a clever twist of the “alien invasion” action archetype.

The movement physics are fairly true to real life - most blocks can only be pushed if there is a block's worth of space behind them, and nothing immediately ahead of them. 

The levels are full of gaps, through which blocks can be pushed - this has the double effect of freeing up extra room in the level, and allowing you to walk over those spaces. Other hazards include ice which prevents blocks from stopping until they go past it. Falling through holes loses you one of your 3 lives - you also have 5 attempts at each screen.

Through five levels, you have to shoot countless enemies, complete with the obligatory mid-level and end-level bosses. The most innovative part of this game comes after a level when you get to purchase new weapons - instead of simply buying upgrades, you can customize your ship by placing your new weapons anywhere on it.

    <resource id="931a69f093d7d1b7b0a6d1ea977bac4a51274715" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Xenon is the obscure and mysterious predecessor to the much better known Xenon 2: Megablast. The game is actually nothing like its sequel, with completely different control scheme and gameplay. The plot overlaps however, with the Xenites making their first attempt to control the galaxy.

Xenon is essentially an overhead shooter, where the player controls the ship and moves around the screen. However, the difference between Xenon and its sequel is that here the player actually controls the movement of the playfield (up or down) by simply moving the ship in the direction of choice. To do this in the sequel, players need to slam your ship against the bottom of the screen and pull back on the stick in order to reverse-scroll the playfield.

It also features a 3D playfield (some enemies, for example, will be mounted on hills of sort, where players can't shoot them). To combat these the player can transform its tank into a plane. The game then switches to the more familiar gameplay style as seen in other vertically scrolling shooters. The plane has to transform back into a tank again to combat most ground units.

In Xenon, upgrades are taken from destroyed enemies.

A distress call is received from space stations orbiting your homeworld, then silence.  A single ship escapes, piloted by a battered man who tells the tale of pods that hatch into acid-spitting Xenos.

A small band of engineers has been dispatched to combat the Xeno threat before it takes over all the space stations and, eventually, your homeworld.  Assemble your band of engineers and fight the Xenos on each station, striving to either clear it or abandon it.  You start out with a standard issue laser, but can pick up additiona weapons as you find them, including Phasers, Lightning Rifles, Poofer guns, and bombs.

Xenophobe was originally an arcade coin-op by Bally/Midway, released in 1987.  Gameplay premise and setting is heavily inspired/influenced by the movie Aliens.

Unfortunately, the area en route to it is vast and treacherous, with lots of obstacles to shoot out, and you will need to trade your items in order to get enough fuel to get there. The gameplay resembles Elite, involving first-person space shooting and trading.

With either one or two players, you must move through a series of Gauntlet-style underground mazes, killing the bad guys and collecting health and other bonuses from flying saucers (underground? SLIGHT logic gap there, methinks).It's designed to be played co-operatively, although bullets from one player can harm the other.

The Xybots are out to stop you, of course, and many have advanced attack patterns as well as bullets to fire at you. Being able to view round corners is useful, allowing you to plan a strategy - often it's good to send one player forward and let the other play the waiting game, as in Gauntlet.

You have to search the surrounding areas looking for your friends and toys while avoiding or shooting various creatures. You are armed with sweets to shoot the creatures but these are limited. If you are touched by a creature or certain obstacles then you lose part of a food gauge and when this is empty then it is game over. As well as the toys and your friends, there are other items that can be collected and they are coloured keys to open the same coloured door, cans of pop to double your speed, extra sweets and jars of honey to make you invincible for a limited period.

His energy is represented by a knife (to the left of the eight &amp;quot;I&amp;quot;s), and he gains it by collecting his show's trademark picnic baskets (as long as that bothersome Ranger Ned Smith is not watching), but if he should ever run out of energy, one of the three prongs on the fork (which represent his lives) will disappear - and if the last prong should disappear, the game will be over. However, Yogi will gain the prongs back at 20000 points and every 30000 points thereafter (if he does not still have all three)</resource>

On one search, Yogi over hears an awful telephone conversation with Ranger Smith that the Park is closing and all animals must be caught and transferred to a zoo. Not wanting to live in a cage or enclosure, Yogi has decided to escape and thus the beginning of his adventure. You have to guide Yogi over six levels (ending in New York) keeping ahead of a tracker and his dog. You must complete each level in 2 minutes 40 seconds or it is game over. On the way there are obstacles like holes and water, as well as other characters to get in your way. Touching these loses one of three lives. Scattered over the levels are various food items which will give you 100 points as well as invisible ones giving 250 points. If you want a bigger score then on certain levels you can collect six items which reward you with 7500 points.</resource>

A horde of largely-organic enemies threaten the safety of your planet, and they must be destroyed over the course of six levels.There are power-ups available, but the game is less centered around these than some are. 

Whilst some shoot 'em ups are much easier with a second player, Z-Out takes design steps to legislate against this. In a 2-player game, most power-ups are unavailable, and even those which are only come into effect on level 3. Another variation is that the 1-player mode uses restart points, but the 2-player mode does not, so as to keep both players in the same place.

Apparently, the resistance forces have captured a number of space ships, which could aid in the struggle against the empire. However, these ships need fuel, and that fuel is find in the form of &amp;quot;klyston pods&amp;quot;, which must be recovered from a range of hostile environments. 

Your task is to fly your small spaceship above and below ground, capturing the pods. Your spaceship can rotate in 360 degrees, allowing for easy movements through the cavesystems, if it wasn't for gravity pulling you down, and intertia which means you could crash into walls or other objects if you don't turn around and thrust in the other direction. 

Each level is cleared by recovering the klystron pods, which are the same thing as the ball you pick up in Thrust. Pick up the pod with your tractor beam, and a towing line will be attached. Towing the ball means that you have another object altering your course, though; if you break quickly, the forces of intertia will make the ball travel forward, pulling you in its direction. At later levels, the pod becomes heavier, and must be pulled using a force field. Travelling too fast will make the ball slip out of the field, forcing you to pick it up again, possibly from a very dangerous area.

The levels are guarded by cannons, which can be shot down using either your conventional cannon or a laser cannon. Beware, though, for the laser eats up your fuel supplies very quickly. Refueling is possible by activating the tractor beam above the fuel pods stationed throughout the levels.

Whereas Thrust used vector graphics, or something with a similar look, Zarathrusta uses detailed bitmap graphics, making for a different look for a similar game.

    <resource id="55931088680be16fb09deef39d8788602f3f220d" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">With a similar gameplay as the isometric Desert Strike, Zeewolf offers arcadesque helicopter-combat in a 3D-surrounding. Despite its mainly action-oriented gameplay, the 32 levels often involve support, transport and rescue missions - dropping or refueling friendly units in the combat zone, for example. In exchange, other units serve you as rearming points or help you fighting the enemy.

The order of the levels can be chosen freely and the game may be played with joystick or - a little unusual - with the mouse.
Although the range of sight is somewhat limited, the 3D graphics are very appealing and perform smoothly while playing. Here the game uses a 3rd person-engine looking at the helicopter from the side and displaying a certain amount of landmass in a square around it.

The level structures involve different military objectives of protecting or destroying a particular area. The surprise is in the graphics: patchwork-quilt style landscapes and a remote view reminiscent of Virus. The game offers joystick and mouse control options, as well as sections in which you must direct ships and planes. A range of weapons are offered with resupply ships on the water to dock with.</resource>

The main twist is that the gameplay is completely 3-dimensional, with control over the horizontal and vertical positions of the bat. The game uses a split-screen view, with the top half viewed from the perspective of Player 1, and the bottom from that of Player 2, even when only one of them is human.</resource>

Zool 2 is a platform game where you control the titular &amp;quot;Ninja of the Nth Dimension&amp;quot; (or his girlfriend, Zooz, who can complete each level in a slightly different way) as he rampages through a variety of levels, collecting countless tasty treats, shooting any enemies that he encounters and finding bonuses (there's a variety of special power-ups Zool can find - for example, a bomb that follows him and can be blown up at any time to remove on-screen enemies, or a temporary invulnerability). New to the sequel is Zool's ability to scale walls and his new spinning attacks. 

On each level you have to collect a certain amount of the featured fruit within an allocated time limit, and then find the exit across the multi-directionally-scrolling levels. There are lots of hidden areas to see, including a bonus Breakout game starring Zool's pet 2-headed dog.

There are various monsters that will try to hunt you down - contact with these costs you energy and eventually a life. There are also a number of power-ups that will aid your quest - quick filling of tiles surrounding the bonus piece, a level skip and bonus points, for example.
