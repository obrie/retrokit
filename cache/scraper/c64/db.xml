Both titles feature gadget laden cars in a vertical-scrolling racing and shooting game. The problem with The Spy Who Loved me is the bad controls, and the low production values. For instance, the boat sections have a little map to indicate where ramps and dead-ends are, but they are sometimes incorrect, causing frustrating deaths. On the plus side, the graphics and music are good on the Amiga and Commodore 64 versions.</resource>

The objective is to reach the top of the pyramid by winning successive rounds. Each round consists of selecting a category from the pyramid. Each category consists of a list of words that share some common thread like &amp;quot;things that are red&amp;quot;. One player then tries to give the other player clues to guess the word without saying the word itself.

There is also a single player mode that does not resemble the show very much where you have to type in single word clues.</resource>

You can select to race against up to three other drivers (a championship with just you driving is possible) who can be either human or computer controlled. The computer drivers can also have their skill level adjusted from 1 to 15. The Championship is raced over 18 tracks but you can also select how many tracks and which tracks to compete on.

Before a race each driver must qualify. You drive round one lap to get the fastest time which decides which position you start in the race. After qualification you now race over four laps but can be changed from 1 to 99. Hitting the side of the track, driving through puddles or hitting other cars slows you down but no damage is inflicted. After the number of laps are completed, each driver is awarded points for their position before moving on to the next race.</resource>

For the first time on a home computer, feel what it is really like to fly a high performance military jet and engage tanks, missiles, ships, helicopter gun-ships and two types of cunning intelligent enemy aircraft.

Featuring over 300 sprite images, ACE has the smoothest most detailed cockpit view of hills, trees and other ground objects ever achieved thanks to specially developed Dynamic Graphics Technique allowing sensational high speed solid 3D graphics.

In combat, your head will spin as you struggle with the help of advanced avionics including rear-view camera and radar, to stay alive long enough to do some damage to the enemy.

The unique two seat flying option (pilot, navigator/weapons man) and Synchro Speech which passes vital aircraft condition information to the flight crew without freezing the action combined with dynamic tactical map, take offs and landings, summer, winter and night-time flying and a remarkably realistic in-flight refuelling option makes ACE the ultimate AERIAL COMBAT EMULATOR.</resource>

You are not in control of the player's motion, but once he gets close to the ball, shot selection is down to you. Standard shots plus topspin, lobs and stop volleys are available, by pushing the joystick in the right direction as you aim the shot.

The game supports up to 16 players in singles matches on a variety of court surfaces.  It includes all of the major world tournaments - the four Grand Slam events at Melbourne, Roland Garros, Wimbledon and New York, plus the Davis Cup and Masters events.  An early attempt at TV-style coverage is offered.</resource>

The game features a succession of courses, which must be navigated in 30 seconds. You must run to the vehicle initially, and will also have to manually remount if you fall off - all costing you more precious time. Careful use of the wheelies and jumps is crucial to completion. Each hazard must be taken at the right speed, which you'll learn through experience.</resource>

Yes, as this Rampage-influenced arcade game sees you play either an ogre or a dragon. Both are searching an island for an egg which will give them super powers. 

This is located inside a building, and to find the right one you must continuously smash them up, using either the ogre's horn or the dragon's tail. Humans must also be attacked as you see them, as their catapults weaken you. Food can be found to restore energy,

Once you have located the egg, a one-on-one beat 'em up battle with your rival ensues - win five of these to finally win the game.</resource>

The story begins when agent Keene's boss sends him on one of two missions: to Vienna to investigate the mysterious disappearance of a famous professor, or to solve the mystery of strange self-replicating non-functioning fire hydrants.

While reading from page to page like a comic magazine you can interact with the characters when you choose what Keene should do or say; sometimes you even can take control over Keene to surpass action sequences.</resource>

Similar to its predecessor, ACE 2 is an oldie head-to-head air combat flight sim set in modern days of aviation. The game has a very strong arcade feel, as all the missions you fly are nondescript or generic. Your plane is also a generic, hypothetical modern fighter, and the goal is to fly different sorties to kill enemy aircraft. Very similar to ACE, except that you can now play a 2-player hotseat game, or solo competition against the computer, in split-screen mode.</resource>

It's white knuckle aerial combat simulation, combining the exhilaration of flight with the gut-wrenching pressure of enemy confrontation. During World War II, Mosquitos downed 659 enemy aircraft and 500 V-Buzz Bombs. Your only allies are your wits, your weapons and your radar. Are you equal to the challenge? Down the Nazi bombers, sink de U-boats, outrun the V-Buzz Bombs and stop the enemy trains to release the POWs. Should you fly around a storm or around? Navigate carefully, consult your intelligence reports and maps to make a decision. Choose your weapons and fuel wisely - once your're on a mission, there's no going back. Select one mission or any combination. If you complete all four successfully - and make it back alive - you'll become the most distinguished flight veteran of World War II - the Ace of Aces!</resource>

In all ten events you fly a BD5J Acrojet over a series of obstacles:

1. In the Pylon Race you have to fly around pylons and land safely. 
2. In the Slalom Race you have to fly a 'figure 8'.
3. In the next event, the Ribbon Cut you have to break two ribbons.
4. In the Inverted Ribbon Cut you perform the same stunt but flying the plane upside down. 
5. In the Ribbon Roll there are two ribbons in a row and you have to fly under one

and complete a full roll followed by flying under the second ribbon.
6. In the Under Ribbon Race you perform a slalom by flying in sequence under three ribbons. 
7. In the Under Ribbon Loop you fly under a ribbon followed by a loop and passing over the same ribbon upside down.
8. In the Spot Landing event you have to fly up to 2,000 feet and land on the runway as close as possible to a marked spot.
9. In the Flame-Out Landing event you perform the same stunt 
but then without the engines running.
10. The tenth and last event, the Cuban Eight, you have to make a half-loop over a ribbon, followed by a half-role, a half loop and flying under the first ribbon again. 

Some game parameters can be set. You can decide how the weather conditions are going to be.
An instrument panel at the bottom of the screen contains several read-outs, like a altitude meter, a compass, an artificial horizon and a vertical velocity meter.</resource>

You are quite vulnerable to attack at first, but power ups come in the form of a Sega van which you have to dock with. The first time you dock you get double fire, the second time gives you a rocket, the third gives a rear force field and the fourth invulnerablility.

By destroying cars and bikes that appear on your way, you can collect A-F letters. Collecting A through to D allows you change into a sportscar which is less vulnerable to attack, but not as nimble. Collect all the letters in order to be able to transform into a high tech plane. This is the final stage of one of the five missions. Only the high tech plane can guide you to your destination in which your main target is hiding.

There is also time limit in which you have to complete the mission. It is advisable to transform into the high tech plane as fast as it is possible.

Picking up flags gives you bonus points with 10,000 points gaining you an extra life.</resource>

    <resource id="c664a12ae76e9e1b86a4debaa70ed73a45787ab5" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">The Addams Family is a platformer based on the movie of the same name. The player takes the role of Gomez who searches for his missing family members. To find them he has to explore different parts of the mansion, e.g. the woods, while jumping a lot and avoiding enemies. In comparison to the other versions of the game this one is more puzzle-oriented, meaning the player has to find keys to access certain parts of the game world. Another big difference is that this version is not side-scrolling, the player is always sees the whole room and the game switches to another one if the player leaves the screen or enters a door.</resource>

This game follows the tradition of Heroes of the Lance with a side-scrolling, action-oriented view, a breakaway from the standard GoldBox RPGs.  Plot-wise, it also takes place between those two games, following closely the novel/game modules written by Weiss/Hickman.

You take control of one character at a time, with each hero having different abilities.</resource>

The gameplay consists of horizontal fighting with a maze like map using doors to change the view.  The party consists of the 8 Heroes of the Lance, using one at a time and the player can switch between them at any time.  Each character has different types of attacks and spells making them more suited to fighting different enemies as well as acting as lives.

One of the AD&amp;D games that takes a break from the usual RPG style.</resource>

Hillsfar is a &amp;quot;single-hero&amp;quot; role playing game (in comparison to other Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons RPGs, where the player usually controls a group of characters). A combination of 1st person perspective (when traveling in the city of Hillsfar) and 3rd person perspective (usually in some action-style mini-quests) viewpoints.

As a would-be-hero, four classes are available in a randomly generated mission-based plot: Thief, Mage, Fighter or Cleric. Each class, to a certain extent, has a different approach for completing quests.

In Hillsfar, gameplay usually consists of various &amp;quot;mini-games&amp;quot; that are needed to complete the quests or missions provided at the local guild by the guild master.</resource>

These bonds have dangerous magical powers that can take control of the heroes at the most inopportune times. They must now search for the source of the bonds, and free themselves from the curse.

The second in the  Gold Box series of role-playing games, Curse of the Azure Bonds is a sequel to  Pool of Radiance. The gameplay is nearly identical to that of the predecessor and other Gold Box games. Following the  AD&amp;D rules of role-playing, the player creates a party of characters (up to the maximum of six). Two new character classes (Paladin and Ranger) are added to the four basic AD&amp;D classes Fighter, Thief, Mage, and Cleric, which were available in Pool of Radiance. Exploration takes place in pseudo-3D environments, from first-person view. Battles (random as well as pre-set) take the player-controlled and enemy party to a top-down battle screen. Commands are issued in turn-based fashion, and the player-controlled characters can freely navigate the battle field. There is also an overview &amp;quot;world map&amp;quot; that allows instant traveling between cities.</resource>

The table design features extra flippers on both sides, which are at the bases of sections of features. The best scores can be achieved by repeatedly bashing away at sections of blocks.

The essential theme of the table is of magic and wizardry, with the targets to be lit including the word 'MAGIC' as well as a weather potion and a magic cottage. Trapdoors must be shot open to get their bonuses, then shot shut again to prevent the ball being lost in them. Extra balls are offered every 10,000 points.</resource>

To unlock these codes, Basildon must piece together several jokes, which are found in various rooms inside a television studio. Once Basildon has collected a joke, they must be entered in the main computer.

Collecting the jokes is not an easy task for Basildon. For one thing, to use certain objects, some other object must be collected first. For another, moving TV cameras roam around in some rooms, and if Basildon comes into contact with any of these, he returns to the computer room and ten minutes of his time is lost. 

However, to deal with the cameras, Basildon is equipped with ten Cooperblasters which can be used to summon Cooperman. Once Cooperman has been summoned, the player is free to navigate him toward the camera, and once Cooperman comes into contact with the camera, it is destroyed. If the player leaves and re-enters the room, the cameras return and the player has to summon Cooperman again, wasting precious Cooperblaster ammo. Cooperman can only be summoned ten times, and the player is unable to collect more ammo, so they need to use Cooperman wisely.

One summon out of ten introduces the player to another character known as Blunderwoman, who does far more damage than Cooperman because whereas Cooperman just flies from one side of the screen to the other in a straight line unless the player interferes, Blunderwoman flies diagonally across the screen and back again without the player's involvement, killing any cameras that she does not kill the first time.

The game ends when the five hours are over.</resource>

Navigate your ships through the Aegean, docking at mysterious islands to collect valuable clues from oracles. Connect the clues, and you'll learn where to look for fantastic treasures.

But the Aegean is a tricky place and you'll need to use your head if you want to make it back to Athens unharmed and laden with treasures.

Educational Value: Aegean Voyage helps children exercise deductive reasoning and learn to plan strategies by analyzing choices. It also improves memory and concentration and introduces many of the characters and places in Greek mythology. Ages 8-Adult.</resource>

Out of the ashes comes a hero, Jonathan Rogers, better known as &amp;quot;Jungle Rogers&amp;quot;, the owner of the asphalt jungle. The only chance of survival is to reach the airdrop platform XV-238, located in the control base of the schizophrenic assassin professor McJerin, and to escape to outer colonies.

There is no easy way to do this. The game is a side-scrolling shoot 'em up, with thugs coming at you constantly, and a few moves to use on them. You must cross the dangerous streets of Manhattan, which have become over-run by feral thieves. Later he awaits for the guardians of the scientific complex of McJerin.</resource>

But as soon as she had built in the crystal, the machine awoke to (of course evil!) life and shot at her with concentrated beam of pure fuzz energy which turned her into a distorted copy of herself.
Unable to grab a clear thought, she staggered out of her flat, while the sinister television ran away towards the train station to take its heels. Only by a lucky coincidence she stumbled upon another crystal lying around in her garden and by this quickly changed back to normal. Then she promptly informed Helena Aldente from the CIB about the case and she put the special agent AGENT USA on the chase for the Fuzzbomb.

Agent USA is equipped with a VERY big hat and ten of the mysterious crystals and a CIB passport, which authorizes him to get handed out free tickets for the trains at all ticket booths in the whole country. But he has to hurry, as the Fuzzbomb transforms more and more honest and tax-paying people into mentally deranged Fuzzbodies and soon the whole nation will fall victim to the Fuzz. It would be the end of the world as we know it!</resource>

The Mad Professor's cunning plan this time is to infect everybody with acne, thus causing the economy to crumble (and not just the economy for Valentine's cards). As with the original, the game is split into distinct sections - as with the original these are each loaded one at a time.

The first section is a horizontally-scrolling shoot 'em up, where Agent X flies freely and must collect powerful weapons to be able to get through. This is followed by some platform action, which involves climbing a tower collecting code pieces along the way. The final section is a Breakout clone, pre-dating Arkanoid as the first game to give a plot behind basic brick-bashing, with the twist that a moving bat at the top of the screen fires the ball back towards you unpredictably.</resource>

These Airborne rangers are dropped behind enemy lines by parachute to perform all kinds of dangerous missions. Gameplay consists of 3 phases:
Reading the mission briefing and outfitting 3 supply pods with machine gun ammo, time bombs, first-aid kits, grenades &amp; LAW rockets depending on this briefing.
2. Flying over the mission map in a V-22 Osprey plane to drop your 3 supply pods and parachuting out of the plane yourself.
3. Performing the actual missions and reaching the pick-up point before time runs out. There are 12 different missions which include capturing an enemy officer, blowing up an ammunition depot, photographing an experimental aircraft and liberating P.O.W.'s

Missions take place in either an arctic, desert or temperate setting. Using the mission map the player must decide the route towards the mission objective. This might require them to crawl through trenches, run around minefields or take out enemy soldiers and bunkers. Airborne Ranger was one of the first games with some missions that required a stealthy approach (staying undetected until a certain time, taking out a guard and stealing an enemy uniform etc.).

Airborne Ranger can be played in practice or veteran mode. In practice mode, gameplay is limited to a single mission, while in veteran mode, a series of missions or an entire campaign is played in order to earn medals &amp; promotions. All missions can be played on several difficulty levels.</resource>

On peut ainsi augmenter sa vitesse, la puissance de son tir, en ajouter un latéral, utiliser un laser,  des missiles à tête chercheuse ou se protéger derrière un champs de force. Comme tous ces shoot, un fois mort on redémarre &amp;quot;à poil&amp;quot;. Il faut donc s'efforcer de tout faire en une seule vie si l'on veut terminer le jeu.
Quant au nom Alcon... Pourquoi pas Slap fight?? Probablement parce que Ah l'con, il a changé le nom!!!</resource>

There are four games to be completed to get Alice back home. Before your game starts you watch Alice follow the white rabbit through the country side and into the rabbit burrow. The next screen shows Alice falling. 

Game One: Alice is in a strange room and must collect potions, slices of cake, keys and a basket to carry her goodies. Alice can go left and right and enter various rooms with the keys she collects. Be careful though of a nasty alarm clock floating around. One touch ends the game.

Game Two: Alice is in a big colourful garden where she must hop from mushroom to mushroom to collect rocking-horse flies. This turns them into red balls. Get as many balls as you can as this will help in a later game.

Game Three: Alice is now on a giant chess board and must get to the other side with the help of the White Knight. Tweedledee and Tweedledum alongside the Jaberwock try push her back.

Game Four: The final game is a croquet game. Remember those red balls from game two. Well you now have to hit them through the hoops before the Queen of Hearts jumps on them and squashes them.</resource>

    <resource id="3ecd9b3140372e45010b916bbe2006e3fceee7b8" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Alice in Wonderland is an adventure platformer based upon the two Alice books by Lewis Carrol and created using the same engine as Below the Root. However, whereas that game had more of a focus on role playing, Alice has more of a focus on puzzle solving.

Puzzles come in a variety of forms including many inventory based puzzles, and more appropriately, given the subject matter, riddles. Also, there are many physical puzzles primarily taking the form of how to get from here to there through jumping and using inventory items to change Alice's size. 

The plot is more inspired by the Alice books than strictly adapting them. Especially the game tries to adapt Carrol's sense of humor in its rhymes and puns. Interestingly, Alice's end of conversations are driven by selecting emotions rather than typing words, and it is possible to anger NPCs and have them stalk off, leaving you to wait until a pre-appointed hour when they will reappear. The time can be discovered by looking at one of the various clocks throughout the game. Time is important because the game must be completed before the Red King wakes, although this isn't much of an issue especially since the game can be saved whenever and mistakes easily taken back.</resource>

The plot of the movie picks up directly after the end of Aliens. Ellen Ripley, the main character of the Alien series, is in cryo-sleep aboard the space ship Sulaco. Unfortunately, an alien or two has stowed away on the Sulaco, and wreaked havoc within the ship. Thus, it crash lands on the prison colony planet Fiorina 161. Ripley and the unarmed prisoners have to figure out a way to survive the aliens terrorizing the colony until help arrives.

The gameplay of the various Alien³ conversions varies from platform to platform. This version is a side-scrolling action game with large maze-like levels. In each level, you have to rescue all the trapped prisoners and then make your way to the exit, all while surviving multiple alien attacks.</resource>

The Busters consist of Karla, Gordon, and Scooter. Each one of them have their own weapons and special attacks.

When you start the game, you can select any one of these characters to play as. There are six missions to complete (eight in the Genesis version) with several stages, and each mission has you blasting aliens all the way to the end, from the streets to the mother ship where you'll meet the mother of all aliens. Unfortunately, blasting these aliens will not be an easy task, as they get tougher in every mission, and are capable of hiding into objects such as plants, postboxes, trashcans, drums, and several others. Each mission has an objective such as rescuing people destroying an UFO.

When you deal with a few aliens, flying heads will appear, which you can shoot to collect life or energy (by the way, life is important to you, since if yours get empty, you're dead). However, rather than using your ordinary weapons, you can use the special attacks that are enough to kill aliens you currently see. These types of attack vary depending on the character you choose at the start of the game. For instance, Gordon summons a U.S. Air Force Jet that drop bombs across the street, while Scooter is able to teleport out of his present location, and leave a series of bombs that will blow up aliens on sight, he will then re-appear. However, using your character's special attack uses up a lot of energy, and if you have little or no energy, you can't use it.

At the end of some missions is an alien boss, which you must destroy in order to complete the mission. Also, at the end of every one, you have to enter buildings where you participate in a shooting gallery. The object is to kill aliens popping up from several locations with the building. 

You can play Alien Storm by yourself, or with another person.</resource>

Swearing a bit too loud about rescuing her, Slough Feg has heard you and turned you into an insect. With the help of magic from the Druid Lords though, you set off on your quest.

To help you, some minions leave behind either a power-up for your weapon or Zen, the currency of The Cave of Dreams. Zen can be spent in the shops that litter the landscape. Here you can buy health or extra weapons. Kai has three lives which are lost when his two energy dots turn from white, cycle through various colours before turning black.

Alien World is a scrolling shoot-em-up. Various levels scroll horizontally while others scroll vertically. The screen will only scroll when you move so far across the screen. You cannot re-trace your steps. As well as the main playing area you can also see your score, amount of Zen, Energy dots, lives and various weapons. The joystick moves Kai, but not touching the joystick lets gravity kick in. The fire button fires your weapon.</resource>

The player controls six characters from a remote terminal, guiding them through a 255-room complex in search of the Alien Queen. Each character has a helmet camera and a smart gun, each controlled by the player acting in the role of overall operational commander.

The player can switch to any character at any time, and must consider coordinating their movements and finding a safe location before switching to the next character. Characters occupy one room at a time, and can pan their view a full 360-degrees inside each room. Doors can be locked to halt Alien progress, or blasted open to get through (at the cost of permanently destroying the door). Alien bio-mass must also be destroyed before it spawns facehuggers, and the Aliens themselves leave lethal puddles of acid when killed (and so shouldn't be killed in front of doors!).

    <resource id="3dcce683d76f65c80586328e727e9d98ff948b3f" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Electric Dreams' game based on the 1986 film Aliens is a first-person strategy game somewhat similar to Space Hulk. The player controls six characters from a remote terminal, guiding them through a 255-room complex in search of the Alien Queen. Each character has a helmet camera and a smart gun, each controlled by the player acting in the role of overall operational commander.

The player can switch to any character at any time, and must consider coordinating their movements and finding a safe location before switching to the next character. Characters occupy one room at a time, and can pan their view a full 360-degrees inside each room. Doors can be locked to halt Alien progress, or blasted open to get through (at the cost of permanently destroying the door). Alien bio-mass must also be destroyed before it spawns facehuggers, and the Aliens themselves leave lethal puddles of acid when killed (and so shouldn't be killed in front of doors!).

The player creates a character with different personality statistics, either by assigning them randomly or by answering a few introductory questions. They then guide this character through seven life phases, from infancy to old age.

The gameplay consists of a series of situations where a decision has to be made. This is done by choosing one of multiple answer possibilities, sometimes accompanied with a mood. Then the player gets presented with the outcome and goes on to the next situation. Every decision has long-time consequences and influences the personality, health and which situations await further down the road. Some decisions may even result in an early death or instant game over.</resource>

After visiting the city, now he proceeds to the dungeon with only one goal in mind: surviving.

While the predecessor was more about exploring the city, this instalment has a largely linear path - the dungeon consists of four levels which have to be visited in order. But the surroundings don't mean that there are only monsters to fight in the turn-based combat system or treasure to loot: the player still has the shops, e.g. an inn or a smithy, to his disposal. Even the six guilds (plus two additional ones) found their way into the dungeon; this time the player even may become a member. An important change in gameplay is that all items have a weight associated with them - carrying too much is bad for speed and endurance.

The dungeon is separated from the city and after entering there is no turning back. Save games can be imported, but the player loses all potions but sixteen.</resource>

At the beginning of the game you enter your name (confirm with &amp;quot;Return&amp;quot;). Of course here you can play for the country of your choice. For this you pick a record with the flag of your choice out of the LP box and a parrot, which sits next to it, takes out the LP with its beak and puts it on the phonograph (joystick forwards/backwards, then fire). Then the hymn is played. This can be repeated until the names of all players have been entered, to finish you press &amp;quot;Return&amp;quot; in an empty name field.

When you have entered all players you get into a screen, in which you can choose what sports you want to play. By moving the joystick forwards/backwards you set in the &amp;quot;video recorder&amp;quot; in the lower left corner the number of the sports event and press fire. Now a nicely animated picture of the sport appears in the corresponding screen. When you have chosen all your desired events you set to &amp;quot;9&amp;quot;. By moving joystick left/right you can choose between &amp;quot;Compete&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Practice&amp;quot;. By pressing fire the competition or training starts with the previously set options.</resource>

Money must be spend on buying improved weaponry (including that needed to destroy the Queen Bees) and repairing the ship throughout the 2500 screens Amaurote is depicted in. As your main weapons are bombs, you need to consider their bounce and distance before firing, to avoid being caught up in stray explosions yourself.</resource>

This game is primarily a platforming game in which Spider-Man fights against various enemies. Those can be stunned with Spider-Man's iconic web substance, but touching them or other hazards in the game world will decrease his health. Another important part of the gameplay are puzzles, mostly with the goal to deactivate some of Mysterio's gimmicks, e.g. changed gravity, to clear the path. Spider-Man can climb walls and shoot grappling hooks.</resource>

    <resource id="a9b04f72f49633cbaf8afb36c52d49bb91c6a837" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">American 3D Pool is a one or two player game featuring both pool and billiards.

The Pool simulation features one player, two player and tournament modes. In the two player mode the game offers a choice between player vs player, player vs computer, or computer vs computer. When playing against the computer the game allows the player to choose their opponents skill level from 'very bad, bad, medium, good and very good.

In the tournament mode the game allows eight players, at least one of which must be human, to take part in a knockout competition. Both two player and tournament matches can be either the best of 1, 3, 5, 7 or 13 frames. The Billiards simulation has the same features as the Pool simulation, the difference being in the scoring of the two player and tournament matches which can be the first to either 15, 25, 50, 100, or 200 points.

The game also features a Trick Shot feature. Nine trick shots are provided and the editor allows further shots to be constructed.</resource>

You must travel to the overrun planet of Sentinel 4, and destroy the weapons caches the rebels have build up. They can't be blasted when you are right next to them, ensuring that a degree of planning and strategy is required.

Viewed from above in levels with simple sideways scrolling, the objective on each level is to shoot each of the weapons crates, before going through the newly-opened exit.  Guard droids must be avoided, but shooting them can leave them inactive for a short period of time, and they can now be shot or hit to push them in that direction, which can be used strategically to make more paths available. There is a 2-minute time limit on each level. Every 5th level has a nuclear weapon guarded by a seeking enemy droid, which continually follows you.</resource>

The ball can rebound off these at unusual angles, making the outcomes of shots harder to predict. The basic objective is to pot all the balls, while failing to pot a ball in 3 shots will lose you the frame unless your opponent also fails to do this.

The game can be played by one or two players, with the one-player game consisting of a sequence of 20 different table layouts, each requiring its own style to win. Two-player games can take place on any of these layouts or one of your own design using the inbult table editor. Shot direction, speed and spin can be set on a general level.</resource>

One of the game's key features is digitised speech, which sounds crackly like a real mission controller would. Telemetry screens provide realism, with the player having to set items and computer programs to get the crucial GO signal.

The game is split into several sequences. First is launch, where pressing the button to stop a moving bar at the right point determines success. Course corrections and an orbital rendezvous (to undock the lunar module) are next. The player has to land the module safely on one of three possible landing sites before running out of fuel. The moonwalk is next, and must be completed in a set time before returning to orbit. On the way home the astronaut performs a spacewalk to capture and repair a satellite. Finally there is the re-entry sequence and splashdown.</resource>

After an attempt to destroy the monolith failed, it was transported to its creators the Ariatans. Now it is up to Charlie to travel to the planet Ariat and prevent the Ariatans from accessing the data.

Gameplay in Arc of Yesod is very similar to its predecessor. Seen from a side-scrolling perspective, Charlie has to explore many large caverns, filled with enemies and transporters, and find eight crystals that he hopes will help him destroy the monolith for good. To get rid of his enemies, he can once again control a device similar to the mole in Nodes of Yesod. Pressing up on the joystick releases a small sphere that can be moved across the screen (while Charlie stands still) and shoot at enemies. Once again, there are enemies that are immune to the sphere, including a spaceman who, when touched, takes away one of Charlie's crystals.</resource>

A magical, mediaeval field depicted as an overgrown chess board becomes apparent in front of you. Inside this mystical area there are mythical creatures as e.g. unicorns, sorceresses, golems, wizards or fire-breathing dragons. If one of those creatures moves to another field, so its life energy changes depending on the colour of the field. If two opponents meet on one square, the playing field turns into an arena.

Your characters use their fantastic abilities to fight against banshees, goblins and wizards. They use spells, missiles and fists, they throw spears and fire. They even take over the look and the characteristics of the opponent. You will need all your skill, agility and intelligence to control and lead your side.

Your magic rises and diminuishes with the light cycle of the board. The same way the light changes, so your abilities change. You need to keep an eye on the time and portion your strength effectively.

Archon is a fight made of action and strategy, which is carried out between two oppositional armed forces, that consist of myths and legends. The light and the dark side consist of the same number of individuals and their strengths are roughly equal, but they are not made up of the same troup parts. Their goals are the same: every side exists to win. Either by destroying all the opposing armed forces or by conquering the five force fields.</resource>

    <resource id="f44b11b48fa9973c276dd0c922244a5ee2445237" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">The original Breakout concept involves controlling a bat at the bottom of the screen and using it to catch and direct a ball so as to hit all the bricks which are arranged at the top of the screen. It was unpopular for over a decade, before Taito revived it with some new ideas in this arcade game.
The game's plot redefines the bat as a Vaus spaceship, the ball as an energy bolt, and the bricks form a mysterious wall stopping the ship from progressing to safety.
By the mid-80s, power-ups were popular in most types of arcade games, and Arkanoid features them. They are caught by positioning the bat below them as they fall (meaning that you risk missing the ball if you go for them at the wrong time). The power-ups include lasers (which are mounted to each side of the ship and allow you to shoot out the blocks), a catching device (so as to be able to fire the ball off at a different angle every time you hit it) and one that slows the bolt down.</resource>

Along with improved graphic engine, better sound and music, better hardware support and more levels, Revenge of Doh also features a built-in editor and allows you to create your own level sets!

Revenge of Doh continues Arkanoid's plot as follows, directly taken (including typoes) from the game:

A long time period passed and the dimension controlling force Doh has again come back to life. Occupying the huge starship Xorg, it has entered our universe from a different dimension. Mixtec, Arkanoid type spaceship, has lauched the craft Vaus II to make a preemptive attack on Xorg.</resource>

Each player is given a colour before a map of the world is filled with a each players armies in random territories filling the whole map. Each player can add three more armies to strengthen any territory they choose before the first player chosen by random has their go. The player can have the choice of attacking a territory or passing on their go, giving the next player his options.

If the player chooses Attack then they select one of their territories before selecting a territory that is touching or touched by a white line. An animated scene is shown for a few seconds of a battlefield before the map is revealed with the losing territory losing an army and the winning territory gaining an army. If all armies are lost then all but one of the winning players army is moved into the empty territory with an option to deploy the players armies given. The winner is the player with at least one army in all the territories.</resource>

Mobantians had no way of defending themselves, so it was clear that extinction was just around the corner unless action was taken.

The leader sent out scouts, who were wise in the ways of disguise and dexterity, to penetrate their strongholds to find out the secrets of warfare. The few scouts that has returns from their mission said that their world had been at wall throughout the entire evolution, and advances in technology meant that they developed weapons that were too powerful enough for their leaders to handle, and in one confrontation they destroyed their own planet. The scouts went on to say that they were the last survivors from that planet they called Earth.</resource>

In part one, you drive a jeep and must avoid collision with other jeeps and being shot at by helicopters. Then, you fly around in a helicopter and the oject is to bring down airplanes without being shot at by the airplanes themselves, submarines, and any other ground fire. Make sure you land on the pad near the end.

In part two, you start out in the jungle and must jump from rock to rock without crashing into toucans (shoot at them to make them fly higher) and being blown to bits. Then you have to make your way to the general's offices shooting soldiers on the way, and finally, locate the secret documents. When you complete the seven sections of Army Moves, you'll receive a higher bonus.

Some versions have a high score table to record your achievements. The second section must be loaded seperately, using a code attained from completing part one, on some versions.</resource>

The game features a full practice mode as well as qualifying and races. There are only 8 computer bikes, although the real life championship points system is used, meaning that the penalty for not finishing is bigger than in real life, especially as you only have 5 bikes to last the season. The game is viewed from overhead, and the controls are, unusually, direction based, so to take a straight which (in the overhead view) involves going up and to the right, you must push the joystick in that direction.</resource>

They can do this due to Getafix the druid's magic potion, however the cauldron used to make this has been smashed into several pieces. Can brave Asterix and overweight Obelix find the pieces?

In this arcade adventure, it all comes down to you. The fifty screens you must explore take in your home village, a Roman encampment, and the forests in between. You have five pieces of wild boar, and these are used as you become hungry.

Contact with wild boars or Roman soldiers triggers a one-on-one fight with punches and kicks. Defeating a boar earns you another piece of food, to restore energy once all lives are gone. Some sections are blocked until you collect their keys.

In the US version the character Asterix was replaced by a barbarian.</resource>

These include many locked doors for which keys must be found, plus teleporters and secret paths.

Weems' main foes are bats and monsters, strategically placed inside coffins, and regenerating when you re-enter a room. Contact with these drains his blood, although fortunately there are replacement vials of this to be found. He is armed with a garlic-firing gun, plus limited numbers of garlic pills, which make enemies avoid him. 

The first five levels feature the objects required to kill the She Vampires — a crucifix, large garlic piece, stake, mirror and mallet. Once they are killed, he must make his escape, facing all those bats and monsters again.</resource>

Your ship is equipped with lasers which can be used to destroy enemy saucers and the mega mines.

Your spaceship also has a limited energy supply; if you get too low on energy, it can be resupplied at one of the generators located in the four corners of the play area.

Hundreds of floors and hallways offer a possible escape from this bedlam created by Screenplay's own inmates. Smooth, scrolling 3-D graphics create an eerie sense of reality as you move through passageways in search of an exit. Fellow residents may offer assistance, but accepting advice is a risky business. Muscle-bound guards block your path-should you tiptoe around them, or fight your way through? Use of complete, complex sentences allows you to reason your way through the endless strange predicaments which will frustrate your efforts to escape.

Play Asylum. All you have to be committed to is having fun.</resource>

Doing so requires several dozens of shots. The camels retaliate by shooting fireballs from their mouth.

Each camel required several shots to destroy; if a camel reached the base, the game was over. Once all camels on a level had been killed, the player had to survive a &amp;quot;hyperspace&amp;quot; sequence which required avoiding high-speed missiles. Upon successful completion, the next level presented a new wave of camels, with slightly harder gameplay.</resource>

It has two teams playing against each other in four, three minutes quarters and the aim is to score the most points at the end of the game to win.

A goal, also known as a sausage roll, is scored if the ball goes through the middle posts and is worth six points while a behind is scored if the ball goes between the side posts, this is worth one point. You can earn possession by tackling the opposition to win the ball. There is also a chance that while in possession you can drop the ball which may cause you to lose possession. Throughout the game, a commentator runs down the action and gives updates on the scores as they happen.</resource>

It gathered a cult following from the elite programmers who knew how to connect to the data bank where it was located, and like all cults, it had its first &amp;quot;martyrs&amp;quot;; several important programmers were fired after becoming &amp;quot;addicted&amp;quot; to it, found playing it late at night while understood to be working overtime instead.

This version, aside from being in Spanish, has with several points worth mentioning, such as having more than 100 detailed locations with graphical illustrations; a special routine of exit descriptions (indispensable for guiding the adventurer through this complex world); and the possibility of using accents, &amp;quot;ÃƒÂ±&amp;quot;'s and opening interrogation and exclamation signs. As well, every object of your inventory is described in text and graphic form. The characters also use the PSI system, so they are not mere objects with human names, but will listen to you and respond -- but most importantly, will act according to how you treat them.</resource>

There are six tracks in the game, complete with stunts and wheelies that the player must accomplish in order to proceed onto the next track. Riding the bike causes energy to be lost, but soda cans can be collected to replenish it. Also, doing stunts causes the player to crash down hard, losing spokes (wheels). Replacement spokes, like the soda cans, can be collected along the way. The game ends when the player does not qualify, runs out of time, or has no spokes left.</resource>

There are 7 courses of increasing difficulty, incorporating ramps and bumps which significantly affect the bike's handling. Each course has a time limit you must complete 3 laps of the course within, or it's game over. The further inside the time limit you are, the more points you score.

There's a computer opponent, but the scoring isn't affected by whether you beat him just so long as you qualify. There is a two-player mode. A unique feature at the time is the action replay, which can be viewed in slow motion.</resource>

It still looks and plays like the first game but instead of two riders racing there are now four. Also instead of just one terrain there is now two, Dirt and Quarry. Dirt racing is still the same as the first game but Quarry racing is classed as expert and you can choose the thickness of your tyres and the chain wheel size.

The game is still viewed from above and the joystick steers your rider while the fire button speeds up and slows down the rider.</resource>

The object of this game is to get out of a maze inside a planet. The maze is comprised of different rooms, and, more often than not, each room has a monster that you need to avoid. When you come in contact with a monster, or use your jetpack, your fuel level decreases. When the fuel gauge is empty, you will lose one of your lives.

Along the way, you will pass containers that store various chemicals, and you will be able to carry only one chemical at once, but you can switch the chemicals around. Some of the chemicals can be mixed together to create other chemicals and explosions.</resource>

The player takes control of teenager Marty McFly; zapped into the past by an experiment gone wrong. To preserve Marty's future existence, the player must lure Marty's mother-to-be into spending more time with his father, while avoiding the school bully. These computer-controlled characters will wander the game areas and interact with each other according to basic rules - Marty's mother will follow him around, his father will avoid the bully, the bully will knock Marty out if their paths should cross, etc.  If left to their own devices, Marty's parents will not meet and his time will run out (indicated by a fading family photo).  

The game world consists of five distinct areas, each the size of one screen. A separate &amp;quot;hub&amp;quot; area scrolls past the entrances to these five zones. Each of the five areas holds a collectable item, with a different effect (attract, repel, or no effect) on each character. A skateboard can also be collected to travel across the hub faster.

The player must use their collected items to keep Marty's mother and father in close proximity, while also keeping the bully away.</resource>

Based on the second installment of the popular Hollywood series Back to the Future, this movie conversion has Marty McFly and Doc Brown travel through time to stop their arch-rival Biff from changing the future. The game consists of five parts, each inspired by one of the movie's most memorable scenes:

1. Hoverboard Chase: A Paperboy clone without newspapers, but with isometric levels and lots of enemies to dodge.
2. Jennifer Rescue: Guide Marty's girlfriend Jennifer out of the house without her meeting one of the four family members. Open and close doors to make the persons go from one room to the next in this top-down puzzle sequence.
3. Beat Biff: A side-scrolling beat-em-up sequence in the tradition of Double Dragon. Fight your way through a grim 1985 by jumping, hitting and kicking at Biff's lackeys.
4. Band Puzzle: Rearrange the mixed-up parts of an animated picture of the school band in this sliding block puzzle. The clock is ticking.
5. Hoverboard Chase 2: Another hoverboard sequence, similar to the first one, only this time set in 1955.</resource>

This game takes four scenes from the Hollywood movie Back to the Future III and turns them into arcade sequences:

1. Buckboard Chase: Doc Brown goes horseback in an attempt to save Hill Valley's lovely school teacher Clara. This game of quick ducking, jumping and shooting alternates between a side-scrolling and a top-down perspective.

2. Shooting Gallery: The name says it all. A classic game of aim-and-shoot, spiced up by hidden extras and bonus targets.

3. Pie Throwing: Meet the Mad Dog gang. They have guns, and you have... cream pies. It's an isometric version of the shooting gallery, only with ammo. And the targets shoot back.

4. The Train: Basically a side-scrolling beat-em-up on train wagons with some ducking and jumping. Get rid of the mechanics and collect speed logs to push the engine to a magic 88 mph.</resource>

Two human players can take part, but only the winner continues without using up credits, so you will only see the early races in two-player mode. 

You are armed with guns, which can be used to slow opposing cars. During the races spanners can be collected, which are then cashed in for upgraded turbos, improved weaponry and engine upgrades. Hazards on the later tracks include ramps, bridges, buildings collapsing onto the track and barriers which open and close in a random sequence.</resource>

This must be done 4 times on each of the 8 levels, as a new layer of bricks are added above the old ones once they're finished. Several bonus items are around to make the task easier. - invincibility, extra lives, automatic layer completion, and bonus points.</resource>

The player controls a cursor that can fire a stream of small balls. These are used to direct a puck across a court to score a goal. In the two-player game, this is hindered by your opponent, aiming for the opposite goal. In the single-player game, a form of gravity is the opposition.

The game starts with a simple court but it gets progressively more difficult with added obstacles, simple mazes and bonus items. There are 130 courts in total (64 on the C64, 30 on the BBC/Electron). A court is completed when either player scores three goals. If the computer wins in the single-player game, that is game over although the game can be restarted from the same court. Goals can score a range of points depending on how far out they are scored from.

The display is an overhead view showing a small section of the court that scrolls to follow the puck.</resource>

Stopping you from doing this are a wide range of enemies, such as hamburgers, video nasties, gophers, giant spiders, the Sitting Bull Bikers, telephones, monitors and more. Each day is split into two sections. The first section has you basically avoiding enemies while collecting money bags, which come in both blue and pink. The blue money bags you have to get, and the pink ones you have to avoid. If you try to get a pink one, then you will lose a life.

The second section involves you riding a horse across the screen, while shooting enemies that get in your way. If a bullet comes in contact with an enemy, then it is stunned and returned to its starting position. If you come into contact with an enemy or touch a fence, you will lose one of your lives. Lose all of them and you are doomed to spend the rest of your days on Boot Hill.</resource>

The barbarian is controlled by using left and right on the joystick to move and up and down is used to scroll through the various commands at the bottom of the screen.
When a command is highlighted pressing fire will perform that action thus saving on extra buttons being needed to play. There are two weapons at your disposal. A sword which you start the game with and later a bow which is handy for long range attacks. There are many traps to avoid and various monsters who have different attack patterns.</resource>

Where Ken says depends on the current game being played, and can include going to the prom, going out to dinner, going to the pool, playing tennis, working out at the gym, or having a picnic. 

You control Barbie, and your job is to get her ready by going shopping and selecting dresses, swimwear, shoes, hairstyle, and other outfits. This can be done by stopping her car in front of a store and going in. You use the joystick to move the &amp;quot;hand&amp;quot; over the various items in the store. You can also select its color and pattern. Clicking on these will cause Barbie to wear it. If you change you mind, you can change into something else. When you wear something you do not need, there is no way that you can remove it.

One of these might not be relevant to the situation, so common sense should tell you what you really need. Once you are done with all of this, you travel back to Barbie's house where you can find out if you have the right outfit. If you did, then you are shown a picture of Barbie and Ken having a good time. Otherwise, you are faced with the next situation.</resource>

The game features Dungeons &amp; Dragons-style characters and follows in the footsteps of its predecessor, The Bard's Tale, also created by Michael Cranford. The Bard's Tale II takes place on a larger scale with an explorable wilderness, six cities, and multiple dungeons which give this game its dungeon crawl character. The game has new features such as casinos and banks, and introduces a new magic user called an Archmage, among other changes from the first game in the series.</resource>

Monsters have invaded the town, terrorizing its inhabitants. Mangar cast the spell of Eternal Winter on the surroundings, isolating Skara Brae from any possible help. Guards that were entrusted with the task of protecting the town have disappeared within one night. Only a party of brave adventurers can save Skara Brae and defeat Mangar. The Bard's Tale is a fantasy role-playing game similar to Wizardry games, with first-person exploration of pseudo-3D maze-like environments, and turn-based combat against randomly appearing enemies. Unlike early Wizardry installments, the town can be explored physically, and parts of the overworld are accessible as well. Several dungeons must be explored before the player can tackle the final quest. Six character classes are available when the player is prompted to create a party of six adventurers in the beginning of the game: Bard, Hunter, Monk, Paladin, Rogue, Warrior, Magician, and Conjurer. The last two can be promoted when specific conditions are met during gameplay. The bard class plays a special role, possessing magical songs that improves the party's performance in combat and are required to solve some of the game's puzzles.</resource>

There are two Sprites, one at the bottom of the screen (lower) and one at the top of the screen (upper) controlled by the players, and in a one player game you control the lower Sprite. Both Sprites move left or right to open and close valves which either fills the bath or empties the bath. If the bath becomes too full then the swan can swim away and if the bath empties then the fish dies and the upper Sprite wins but if the water level stays at the correct level between 40 seconds to one minute then the lower Sprite wins. An elephant and a boy occasionally walk to the edge of the bath with the elephant removing water while the boy puts water in.</resource>

Part one, the chemical plant: Hunt down Jack Napier who has raided the plant (typical platform action, climb ladders or use &amp;quot;Bat&amp;quot;-rope and shoot at some enemies...). Part two, &amp;quot;Batmobile&amp;quot; (...the car): Joker is chasing you and have to escape to &amp;quot;Bat&amp;quot;-cave. Avoid obstacles like police blocking the road and others. Part three, &amp;quot;Bat&amp;quot;-cave: A puzzle game where you have to find a certain item (belonging to Joker) amongst other items. Part four, &amp;quot;Batjet&amp;quot;: Cut the ropes of the balloons which are filled with poisonous gas. Part five, the cathedral: Hunt down Joker. This part plays like the first one. Finally you will confront Joker in a fight that decides the fate of Gotham city.</resource>

Unusually, the game features both a helicopter and a tank - you choose either from the base, and can fly/drive back there to change. The best strategy is to use the helicopter to shoot out air-based enemies and repair the various bridges, then return for the tank. You get 4000 seconds in which to complete all this, and losing a life costs you 500 of these.</resource>

A computerized opponent, fairly obviously, as well as the chance to play without using up the earth's limited paper and pen resources. The possibility of cheating is removed as well.

Elite go beyond this by changing the shapes of the ships to be more Tetris style, and allowing these to be placed at each of the 4 main angles. A 'Salvo Fire' mode sees each player fire a succession of shots (each of your six ships gets four shots a turn until it's sunk), meaning that strategic play involves firing on a wide range initially in the hope of finding a ship, before homing in on the area in the next turn. Finally, there's an animated sequence for each go, which is depicted as an air strike. As well as standard two-player games, there's also a multi-player mode in which the winner's score accumulates until he loses, allowing for a “winner stays on” structure if there are 3 or more of you.</resource>

Jason is training hard to become a battle mech pilot, following his renowned father Jeremiah. One day, the Citadel is attacked by the forces of the Draconis Combine from a neighboring star system. Barely escaping, Jason teams up with a member of Crescent Hawks, a special unit established by Jeremiah. Together, they must find the other members, ready to face the new threat. This will be harder for Jason than for anyone else, for he is sure that his father was among the attackers...

BattleTech: The Crescent Hawk's Inception is a role-playing game based on the BattleTech franchise. The first part of the game is spent training in the Citadel, acquiring the game's currency and experience, and learning how to fight in battle mechs or on foot, using smaller weapons. Afterwards, the game follows a more traditional RPG structure: Jason explores Pacifica, visiting its cities, recruiting companions, and fighting enemies in turn-based combat.</resource>

Earth has been invaded, and you and your tank lead the defensive effort. You drive around the battlefield from a first-person view, targeting and firing at tanks, planes and UFOs. You have a radar to help you see where the enemies are in direction and distance. Objects can be used as strategic cover. Controls simulate the tracks of a tank realistically, so the direction and speed settings are varied - combining forward right and backward left movements (as you can on keyboard versions) sees you change direction more quickly.</resource>

In level 1 the first enemies are motorcycle helmet/ninja soldiers and helicopters above, and there's so many of the motorcycle helmet/ninja soldiers. They run by so fast that the player doesn't have enough time to react to them, taking the player character's health meter down as they bump past him. The entrance to level 2 is an airbase called &amp;quot;Clark Airbase&amp;quot; where elite soldiers run and kick the player character in the backside and run off, then the player character takes to the air, and level 3 (Mindano Island) has foot soldiers that have been equipped with flails. The entrance to level 4 (Corregidor Island) is an airport with the elite soldiers, and then the player character takes to the air once more.</resource>

It consists of eight rounds and you must complete each round within the time limit to advance. During the rounds you must jump over rocks and fire as well as shoot helicopters as they will make you crash and lose time.

You have a set amount of fuel and you must collect fuel canisters to replenish it and maintain your speed. Should your fuel count reach zero you will go slow until you collect a canister which would also cost you time. You also cannot fire with your fuel empty. If you complete all eight rounds the game loops over and you begin at round one again. If you fail to complete any round within the time limit, your game is over.</resource>

You control a beam riding spaceship on a mission to clear 99 sectors of space from hostile aliens. The spaceship is located at the bottom of the screen and it can only stop on one of five beams. You are armed with both lasers and torpedoes; torpedoes are more powerful and can destroy more enemies compared to lasers, however you only get three per level. To complete a sector, you need to destroy fifteen white flying saucers. After all saucers are destroyed, the sector sentinel passes by which can be destroyed for extra points. Each even number sector up until sector 16 will add a new type of enemy to deal with. These additional enemies will just try to slow your mission, though, only the saucers need to be destroyed to advance. Occasionally a rejeuvinator will appear; if this is collected, you can earn an extra life. But be careful, because if you accidentally shoot the rejeuvinator it will turn into an enemy!</resource>

    <resource id="84388323e27c2cdd3980efa73c0a2a9574402533" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">In Beat-it, sequel to Jammin', the player takes the role of the musician Rockin' Rodney (or his girlfriend Rachel) who needs to collect notes to complete his new composition. The notes are found in 60 non-scrolling levels. These are composed of vertically arranged alleys of three different colours. The player can't directly move from one colour to another; two walkways (one from left to right, the other vice versa), which are at the top and bottom of the screen, have to be used.

Enemies have different effects when touched: distorted notes steal already collected real notes, joysticks cause the controls to be reversed and a shrink causes the protagonist to split up. Others turn off the light or cause a life loss. Besides notes there are other positive and negative items to collect or avoid, respectively: cigarettes slow down the walking speed; flowers can be brought to the non-selected player character for extra points.</resource>

Space fighter shoots patterns of swirling aliens and stationary cannons, collects extras and fights boss ships – Bedlam is ordinary shoot’em-up material, stretched out over 16 short levels and spiced up with your standard two-player option.

While ZX Spectrum and C64 see a genuine space shooter with full-screen backgrounds and level variations, CPC and DOS get bare-bone versions stripped down to Galaga level.</resource>

Green-Sky seems headed for certain disaster - unless someone can discover the secret of its survival.

It also combines fast-paced excitement with a unique text menu - a first in the field of adventure games.

First Axel Foley visits a warehouse to shoot out some bad guys in a Green Beret-influenced sequence.

The second level (first on the C64 version) involves driving after 3 lorries full of weapons, and shooting them out one by one, Chase HQ-style. Avoid contact and stay on the road to complete this. Next you must cross the grounds of a mansion, shooting anyone who gets in your way.

The final section is set within the mansion, and is first-person 3D, although with few movement angles and only one enemy on screen at a time.</resource>

Quite frequently in the game, the player is attacked by one of Beyond ZorkÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s many monsters. Apart from the high semi-random fatality rate in Beyond Zork, there are random elements in both the make-up of the map and in the placing of certain objects and creatures each time the game is played.

The game is written in Interactive Fiction Plus and there are a whole lot of new features and commands at your disposal.The quest is to find the Coconut Of Cuendor.

Beyond Zork is a clever combination of an Infocom text adventure with a D&amp;D type role playing game. I am not sure that the combination works well. Nevertheless, the game is a must for all Infocom fans (the name alone should ensure that) for it is better than a number of their titles, particularly some of the more recent ones.</resource>

The background changed to reflect the passage of time, going from bright daylight to starlit night. The main character could also move in and out of the screen. Armed with a bow and unlimited arrows, the aim was to kill the terrible creatures of the forest to earn golden arrows. Dying reduced the stock of golden arrows by half.

The player aimed by moving the joystick while holding fire, which changed the elevation bars in the side borders. Releasing fire shot the arrow. Among the enemies in the forest level were Vermes (giant worms that burst out of the ground), Dragonflies, and Scorpions. When enough arrows had been earned, the player could choose to enter the caves. Here there were swarms of bats to avoid and kill, a multi-headed hydra breathing fire and the final bad guy - the Demogorgon, who had one weak point.</resource>

You play as 3 characters, one at a time, in this action platformer: 

- Jack Burton, a burly but bit dumb action hero who fights with fists and later with a &amp;quot;Bushmaster&amp;quot; gun.  Ammo must be found to be able to keep using it.

- Wang Chi, whose girlfriend along with Jack's has been kidnapped, uses Martial Arts and later a sword when found.  More swords will be needed as they will break after awhile.

- Egg Shen is a magician who has vowed to stop the ancient prophecy from coming about, and fights with magic bolts which can turn later on into more powerful lightning if magic potions are found.  

Each character has an energy status bar at bottom of screen represented by a Yin and Yang Symbol that slowly disappears but can be replenished by finding food.  A weapons symbol is shown if they possess it and magic potion symbol will give them extra strength if found.  You must alternate among the 3 characters to keep their status from falling too low and dying, and each has to pick up their own appropriate weapons.  They all can move forwards and backwards, jump, duck and attack at different heights.

They have to fight through several levels including the streets of Chinatown, where martial artist enemies await and gunmen that must be avoided until more experience is gathered. Further on, you go into the sewers where additional monsters must be avoided by jumping over them.  Then they will reach the rooms of the underground lair of Lo Pan where large-hat wearing elementals called Storms await.  The final battle takes place in the Marriage chamber where armoured warriors and the levitating Lo Pan must be vanquished in order to free the kidnapped girls.</resource>

Jim travels back through time to warn Biggles of a spectacular weapon the Germans have created, with the intention of changing history – for the worse.

The game is split into two separate games, and the first of these is itself split into three sub-games. The first of these is a side-view flight game, in which you must shoot down and dodge Fokkers who come at you from the right of the screen in your rickety plane, with a machine gun and bombs on board. Part two is set in modern-day London, and the characters must jump across a network of roofs in order to obtain a secret code. There are guards to avoid, and big gaps between roofs to avoid. The third part is a side-view game inspired by Green Beret, with a gun to fire at encroaching enemies, gameplay on multiple vertical levels, and grenades to collect. Lose a life in any of these and you will cycle back through them.

The second game is a more serious flight simulation however. A helicopter is beamed back in time for our intrepid hero to use.

You can choose any act to perform as well as the number of lives, the difficulty and vary the score. The acts you perform are all viewed from the side and are as follows:
Act 1: You have to walk on a tightrope for 100m in a limited time with the screen constantly scrolling. Monkeys and fire hoops appear, the monkeys must be stepped over and the hoops jumped through. 
Act 2: You have to collect ten balloons while avoiding being hit by the strong man, Otto, who is walking around the screen. 
Act 3: You are on a unicycle and you have to ride it for 100m in a limited time, the screen is constantly scrolling from right to left.
Act 4: The last act takes place on a single screen. You bounce on one of the three trampolines but you can jump from one to the other to collect keys.</resource>

You play the role of Bionic Ninja and you must use various martial arts as well as shruiken's and swords, to destroy or avoid the various occupants of the base. You are able to switch between any of the three attacking options by pressing the space bar at any time. If you are touched or shot by any of the enemy then you lose part of a power bar and if it empties then you lose one of five lives but extra power can be collected on the way.

Once you have shot enough Pods then you move to another wave but if you are hit by a Bit then you lose one of three lives. Before the game you can select the speed (1-3) with one being the slowest, and the skill level (0-29) with the higher skill levels having more Bits on screen.</resource>

Plenty of dirty tricks to help you are on offer, from setting fire to opponent's rigs to stealing the storage tanks which hold the oil in place. Private investigators can be hired to either prevent to prove these things.

Although primarily a strategy game, a few short action sequences are also included. These come into play when attempting to drill for oil (you can hire a specialist to do this instead, but the cost is prohibitive in the early stages), to build oil pipelines around those of your opponents, and to extinguish any fires opponents start on your rig.</resource>

Eight of the nine lamps may be found randomly scattered around the kingdom (in locations which change with each new game), but the ninth lamp, the black lamp, is guarded by a dragon which must be defeated before the lamp can be recovered. Each lamp must be returned to one of several lamp racks in the kingdom. As the player can only carry a single lamp at a time, this can mean a lot of traveling back and forth. Once all the lamps have been returned to the rack, the level is complete, and the player advances to the next level. The game takes place across a series of static and scrolling rooms, which are connected by doorways leading into the foreground or background, as well as up down, left and right.</resource>

Blagger's quest is not easy. Many movie characters such as James Bond, Batman, Superman, Jaws, Tarzan, Robin Hood, and the Incredible Hulk roam the movie set; each character recognizable by its theme tune as you approach them.

It is up to Blagger to kill each character using a variety of props that are scattered around the sets. Each prop must be connected with the movie star; any other prop will have no effect. When a star is killed, it will leave behind an object that you can use to kill other characters. Once all the characters have been killed, you can proceed to Speilbum's office where all the characters are resurrected and you must kill them once again.</resource>

Gameplay follows the usual pattern for Ikari Warriors-style games - kill off the bazooka-toting baddies, which emerge from hiding places or enter the screen in waves. You can do this by either shooting them or running them over with your tank. Parts of the scenery often block your path and need destroying. Once you clear the level you are confronted by a boss, which in the first level is an enormous tank which you have to disable the guns of.</resource>

The user controls a paddle and needs to catch a ball with the paddle each time it comes down. When the ball hits a brick, it is destroyed (unless it's made undestroyable). Sometimes, a bonus will come out of the brick. This adds to the 'bonus score'. When the player collected one or more bonuses, he may 'release' them, and he receives a powerup. Each 'bonus score' has a different powerup: the most powerful powerups need the largest number of bonus points. Impact comes with a lot of levels and a level editor.</resource>

The player has 4 missions to take on, in each case trying to kill baddies for the money they have, which can be spent in the shop rooms to upgrade their craft. Energy is depleted by contact with enemies and the walls, although there are some baddies who simply hover on your ship and steal, rather than physically doing damage.

The game is a shoot 'em up which scrolls both horizontally and vertically, while being viewed from an R-Type style sideways perspective. Navigating the levels sometimes requires the player to duck through gaps in scenery.</resource>

Chatsworth's fame began in battle, when he was out on a reconnaissance mission, and his squadron was decimated by enemy planes.  The pilot survived, and in the process shot down seven enemy fighters.  He shot down thirteen more the next month.  For these actions, Germany offered their Blue Max medal to anyone who could shoot Chatsworth down—and Chatsworth got a new nickname—Blue Max.

As Blue Max, you go out on sorties—flying missions—attacking assigned targets.  Targets include bridges, buildings, enemy planes, tanks, bridges, anti-aircraft batteries, vehicles and ships.  You progress to new missions as you take out your targets.

You must drop bombs to take out the ground targets, and this action also represents a key danger for you.  Unlike the modern bombers that drop bombs on targets far below, early aircraft engaged in semi-suicidal bombing runs.  The pilots started at high altitude, then tipped the planes nose downward towards their ground-based target, and pulled up before they hit the ground.  In the middle of the dive and pull up process, they released the bomb.  There were problems of coordination, found in the game as well—if you time it wrong, or start too low, you will crash.

This game has aroused some controversy too, which supposedly caused it to be banned in Germany.  In the course of your missions, you end up bombing houses.</resource>

Egyptian pyramid, medieval castle and Victorian haunted house. Good job Bod is a good friend of Dr. Who. In the TARDIS Bod travels back in time to rescue his kids. The Bod Squad is a one-player, flick-screen platform game. You control Bod with your joystick and you can jump, squash (duck), swim and sometimes fly. To help Bod on each level there are potions, springs, teleports and hidden platforms. Switches also can be found to make walls disappear. Trying to stop Bod are many enemies, pressing your fire-button slings Bod-bombs to destroy these. Also scattered around each levels are spikes, heads that spit fire and bear-traps. Touching any of these loses one of only three lives. Another hindrance is the time limit, which can be topped up by finding a potion.</resource>

This sounds easy, right? Wrong! Making Jack's task difficult are numerous enemies such as birds, mummies, turtles, and orbs.

In each round, collecting a number of bombs results in a bonus coin appearing, and collecting this coin will make the player's score increase 2 to 4 times. More often than not, the &amp;quot;power ball&amp;quot; appears, and when you collect this, you can defeat enemies and have more time to collect all the bombs. There is also the &amp;quot;E&amp;quot; coin, which gives Jack one additional life, but rarely does this coin appear.

The more you progress through the game, the more difficult it becomes, as enemies travel more quickly to get you.</resource>

These vary between open and shut - the open ones offer more points, and an extra life is on offer for collecting 10 in a row, so if possible the route should take in the open ones in order.

Gameplay differs from the original, in that Bombjack's movement is no longer free and self-propelled. Instead, he moves flick-style between ledges, so long as one is directly within one of the 4 compass directions. Baddies can be pushed off ledges, but this uses up some of Jack's limited energy.</resource>

In order to advance to the next level, all bombs need to detonate. There are various sizes of bombs. Bigger ones have such a huge blast radius that Bombuzal cannot trigger them directly - instead, he has to explode smaller bombs first and cause a chain reaction. So as one might imagine, later levels turn into loud blastfests that need to be carefully planned.

Besides, later levels introduce all kinds of additional hazards and gimmicks, like ice floors, movable bombs, disappearing ground tiles, and much more. Nobody said being a pyromaniac is easy.</resource>

This figure asks them to collect certain items that he has placed inside various buildings to test his security force. If they return the items successfully, Mobo and Robo will be rewarded. The two of them state that they will get the job done in just three minutes. However, little do they know that each building is packed with security guards who will raise the alarm if they are caught red-handed. Fortunately both Mobo and Robo are equipped with bullets that can knock the guards unconscious for a few seconds. An $100 reward will be given out if Mobo and Robo are apprehended.

As either Mobo or Robo, you must collect all the treasures before leaving the ten buildings and shoot any security guards that get in your way. Remember that you are under a time limit. An in-game map will help you locate the treasures. There is a bonus stage after three buildings, where the object is to collect the gold bars in a limited amount of time without  one of the three spotlights shining on you. If it is possible, hide behind open doors. If you manage to get all the gold bars, 10,000 points is added to your score. There are three of these bonus stages, but each of them varies.</resource>

Once you have cleared each one, you have 45 seconds to escape the hold and prepare for the next one.

The levels all feature lots of doors, each of which has its own key to open it - these are numbered. As only one key can be held at a time (pick another up and the first one returns to its original location), and many of the enemies are located behind doors, a great deal of strategy as to which order you collect these in is required.</resource>

Gameplay involves walking through the streets and taking out any enemies that get in the way. Kicks and punches are your basic moves at first, but as the game progresses, new moves and attacks become available, and new enemy types to beat up as well.</resource>

The game is a top-down shoot 'em up, with aliens to kill and rocks to destroy. Each wave has several Space Stations, and destroying these is the ultimate goal. A scanner helps you find these. 

The ship can be brought to a stop, or flown in any of the four main directions. You must watch the fuel gauge, but extra fuel and improved weapons can be collected. There is a mothership which can be docked with for shielding.</resource>

As Bounty Bob, your goal is to claim every inch of 25 challenging mines. To do this, you must walk over each segment of the framework in the mines. To reach each segment of framework, you will need to figure out a way to jump, climb, or use one of the many devices occasionally available to get there. To your help you get around (or sometimes hinder progress) are ladders, slides, suction tubes, cannons, transporters, and other devices. Wandering about the mines are many dangerous mutants. If you come in contact with one of these, you will lose a life. Scattered throughout each mine are special food items; collect one of these, and you will temporarily be able to eliminate the mutants by walking into them. You will need to figure out a unique strategy for each level in order to complete it, plus there is a time limit so claim all the territory quickly!</resource>

The only man tough enough to keep order in such a place is Marshall Bravestarr. Stampede is the villain of the piece; he aims to bring the dead back to life as zombies for his own use.

BraveStarr is a side-scrolling action title based on the popular 80's space western cartoon series. Starting with a limited amount of time, you must find and rescue Shamen who was captured by the evil Tex Hex, to aid Stampede's plans. You get nine minutes to complete your task.

The game begins in Fort Kerium in front of the bar. You can enter buildings, to talk to people and examine rooms. Outside, you must jump around, shoot enemies and collect various power-ups they drop. Marshall BraveStarr has only one life - when he takes damage, he loses time instead of life energy.</resource>

Before you start dancing you can change the colours of yours and the judges clothes before being presented with your first move. After being given a move you must use joystick combinations to perform it while a energy gauge increases. Once you have used your energy then you are given a comment by the judges like 'Your bad news' or 'Murder'. Some of the moves you are given are the 'Space Shuttle, 'Turtle' and the 'Head Spin'. Once all the moves have been attempted you are given a final rating before you can attempt them all again.

The only way to transform back is to reach the end of the cave...

Bubble Bobble is a platform game, with each level being a single screen. The enemies must be cleared from a level to go to the next one. With one player controlling Bub and the other controlling Bob, the player can jump and collect items for points (such as fruit). The real power Bub and Bob have however is the ability to blow bubbles. These bubbles can be as platforms to leap on, or to trap enemies. Enemies trapped in a bubble must be popped by jumping into them, wherein they'll turn to fruit. Additionally, power-ups sometimes float by in bubbles. They include lightning, which flies out horizontally at enemies, and water, which drags the player and enemies straight down flowing over platforms. Taking too long to complete any level will summon Baron Von Blubba, who will float around the screen trying to destroy the player.</resource>

You must guide Dizzy through the underwater worlds, collecting pearls as you go. Dizzy starts at the bottom of the sea, and you have to get him to the top. You do this by jumping across bubbles, which only have a limited time before bursting. Enemies to avoid include sharks, octopuses and swordfish. Dizzy has limited oxygen, but more can be collected from O2 canisters. 

After completing a level, you get a bonus for the amount of pearls you collected and the amount of oxygen you have left.</resource>

Each course has five legs, each filled with obstacles such as boulders and brick walls. Points are awarded for driving through gates and collecting flags.

The player could also hit logs and tree stumps in order to jump the buggy over obstacles, gaining extra points while airborne. Extra points are also rewarded for driving the buggy on one wheel.</resource>

The computer version features 2 players, both human-controlled - on TV there were 3 teams of 2 (one amateur darts player and one to answer questions)

The first round uses a custom board which is split both inwards (4 separate grades representing 30,50,100 and 200 points respectively) and around (10 sections lettered A-K, representing a different subject each). The first player must choose a category to aim at, and shoot a dart at it. If they hit one of the sections for that letter, they get that score and are asked the question. If they hit another category they get no bonus but are asked that question - if it's still there. Each players gets 3 goes at this, with increasingly tough questions worth 30,50,100 points.

Round 2 involves each player throwing 3 darts at a standard board, with the player who scores the most getting asked a question, with the value of the darts on offer. If they get it wrong, the other player gets a chance, for the points THEY scored. This is repeated 3 times.

After these 2 rounds, the player who is in front gets to aim at a board with 8 black segments, 8 red ones and the bullseye. The bully scores 50 points, the others reds score a randomly-selected value between 15 and 45, the blacks score zero, and hitting a red for the second time loses you that prize - hence the presenter's catchphrase &amp;quot;keep out of the black and into the red, nothing in this game for 2 in a bed&amp;quot;.

Once the player has finished the round, they choose whether to gamble their score against the final Prize Board. 101 points must be scored in 4 darts (in the TV show it was 6 - 3 for each player)</resource>

    <resource id="63a6544e2333e3d8a8a6cc9d6351d5eba5e13cf9" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Do you like to play darts?  Would you like to have the opportunity to play darts on your computer?  Here is your chance.

This game offers seven scoring styles such as Golf, Cricket, and the normal 501 scoring style.  Choose how you want to score the game and hop right in and play.  Aim your dart with your joystick or keyboard, then let it fly and hope you hit something good!

The game automatically scores for you so if you do not know how to score a dart game, you can still play.  Knowing what you should aim for is helpful for getting high scores, however.

The darts games included in this package are:

1. 501
This is the classic darts game where both players start with 501 points. Scores are reduced by the amount each player scores when it's their turn to throw. A leg ends when one player reduces their score to zero by hitting a double. A game is the best of three legs.

Round the Clock
The player must hit each number in turn, starting at one and ending with the bullseye. A game is the best of three legs.

Football
In this timed game, the number of each segment plays no part on this game.
Each player has a designated 'goal' area. Players take it in turns to hit a sequence of beds progressing towards the opponents goal. The winner is the player who has scored the most goals when time is up.

Tennis
The player serving must hit doubles, the player receiving must hit trebles.
A bed is highlighted on the board, this is the 'tennis ball'. The server has two chances to hit their designated bed to 'serve' the ball. If they are in successful the point goes to the receiver. If they are successful the receiver must hit their designated treble bed. This is repeated until a player fails to hit the ball. Scoring is as in tennis. A match consists of the best of three sets.

Golf
Only the numbers one top eighteen are used in this game, representing the eighteen holes on the golf course.
The object is to hit each number three times, hitting a double or a triple counts as two or three respectively, starting at one and working through to eighteen. The winner is the player to complete the game with the fewest darts

Cricket
In this game the players represent the batting and the bowling sides at cricket.
The 'bowler' attempts bowl the batsmen out by hitting the inner or the bullseye, the inner takes out one batsman, the bull takes out two.
Meanwhile the batting player attempts to score as highly as possible, but only points scored over forty count.
The team with the most runs after two innings are the winners.

Snooker
All numbers count in this game, numbers one to fifteen represent the fifteen red balls on the snooker table, while the remaining numbers represent the colors, sixteen being yellow and so on through to twenty being black.
To score, or pot a ball, that ball has to be hit by the player in sequence. The red balls must be hit once and the colored balls four times (doubles and trebles count as two and three hits respectively.) Play follows snooker in that after a red ball is potted a color must be attempted, hitting a ball out of sequence ends a turn and forfeits points etc. The player with the highest score wins.</resource>

You can only fire one shot at a time and you can only fire once again if a bullet hits a bunny. If you miss a bunny or just fire then the bullet will keep bouncing off walls until it hits a bunny. If you hit a bunny or touch the walls then you lose one of three lives. Once enough creatures have been collected then you move to the next level but some bunny's now have a shield and can't be shot.</resource>

To properly make a hamburger you must assemble all of the ingredients together, dropping them from higher up onto the burger area below. To actually do this you have to let Chef Pepper step over every burger ingredient. As soon as an ingredient (a piece of lettuce for instance) has been stepped on, it will fall to the level below. Falling food will squish any enemy following you and will also &amp;quot;bump&amp;quot; any other ingredient below it farther down. Also, as an emergency defense against the enemy food, you can collect pepper shakers which will allow you to puff out a small pepper cloud that will momentarily stun enemies, allowing you to walk past them.</resource>

The game is a standard platform title, in which you can shoot peanuts at your enemies, or use bombs you collect.

You start with 9 lives, which sounds generous, but the levels are full of spikes and bad guys which can come to get you at any point. The enemies include policemen, Indians, dogs and burly American footballers (quite a stereotypical view of Americans there). Each level has a guardian at the end.</resource>

That means trekking halfway around the world, armed only with an infinite supply of peanuts and a handful of bombs (fortunately more can be collected as you go along).

You start with nine lives, but the game's design is such that a lot of deaths will be unexpected, so prior knowledge of the layouts is essential to get through most sections of the five levels without losing lives. The two-player mode involves the screen following the lead player, so the latter can lose lives by getting too far behind. With lots of precise jumps across vertically-progressing ledges involved, a lot of skill and timing is required.</resource>

The surfing event is ranked by judges, which give a score to help the players improve their routine.

The Atari versions (2600 and Lynx) of the game omit the flying disc and roller skating events, while the Genesis version omits only the flying disc event.</resource>

Morlock develops a new video game about aliens and space travel. While testing for the first time his new project, he becomes warped inside the spaceship of the very game he had designed. Soon after, Blood is forced to go into hyperspace mode and, due to an incident, gets accidentally cloned 30 times. For 800 years, Blood tracks down every clone, as each one took a portion of his vital fluid. When the game begins, Blood has successfully disintegrated 25 clones but he needs to kill the last five clones who turned out to be the most difficult to track down or he will lose his last connection with the human species.</resource>

Does that sound like a job for a retired superhero? Captain Dynamo thinks so, and aims to recapture them for their rightful owner.

Gameplay is platform-based, with 12 vertically-scrolling levels, each containing around 50 diamonds - the more of these you can collect, the higher your score. Some will require advance planning to reach, while you will often be dependent on booster pads to reach the higher sections of a level.</resource>

Each level has doors which are locked with colour coded keys, as well as doors which can only be used in one direction, and lots of long corridors and mazy layouts.

Players starts in the town located on an island, and they are free to travel around the island. Locked doors are scattered around the island, and correct, color-coded keys, also scattered around the island, are required to unlock them. Also, one of the ?Messengers of Doom? will appear, move around, and then disappear. If the player touches one of them, then the game ends. Many items and scrolls are scattered around the island, and only three of these objects can be carried at the one time. Some of the items include a crucifix, a gun, a shovel, mushrooms, and an helicopter. Some items, such as the gun and helicopter, cannot be used until the correctly filled-out scroll is carried. When the scroll is carried and utilized, the scroll tells the player what item that they can now use. Pressing the Fire button brings up a menu, allowing the player to do nothing (if they accessed the menu by accident); pick up, use, drop, or stop using items; perform a special ability; or quit the game. Choosing to quit will cause the game to perform a count-down as confirmation. If the count-down is interrupted by the player, then the player is returned to the game. If the count-down reaches zero, then they are returned to the title screen. Food is scattered on the island, and eating food causes the player's energy to increase. If energy reaches zero, the game will end.</resource>

As a Prince or Princess armed with a slingshot, you have to explore a medieval castle to free your beloved from the evil Magister. 

Gameplay combines action and puzzle-solving, across four primary towers with three levels each. Doors must be opened using one of the ten included keys. These are unmarked, as are the various potions - making it a challenge to know which keys open which doors, and which potions are beneficial. 

Contact with ghouls drains your energy, as does falling too far (there are narrow pathways to negotiate), while eating cheese can replenish this. Movement and aiming are controlled separately.</resource>

The ingredients are all located in underground buildings, each of which can only be entered once you've found the appropriate key. The keys are located overground, and you must fly around on your broom to collect them.

The overground sections play like standard shoot 'em ups, as your broom is not affected by gravity and can fire bullets using your magic energy. Bats, fireballs and even seagulls are among the many creatures trying to stop you - contact will cost you more energy than shooting at them would. There are energy recharges on offer.

Once you go underground, the gameplay becomes a test of precision platform jumping, including some Manic Miner-esque blind jumps. The six underground sections can be completed in a variety of orders, but you will sometimes reach points that cna't be completed without objects from other sections, so a lot of back-tracking is required. Although you start with nine lives, they won't last all that long at first.</resource>

As the poem in the instructions sheet explains, the only way to put things right is to capture a lock of her hair, then take it to the cauldron and cast a spell to undo things.

Controlling the pumpkin is difficult at first, as it has a very high bounce, the exact level of which can be toggled using the 5 key. Direction can only be changed when the ball is on the ground. Ricocheting into enemies costs energy, and you only gain weaponry by landing into magic pools. The starting positions are random, making mapping advisable and increasing the initial challenge.</resource>

Unfortunately, searching for the eggs comes at a price. Ug must also leap across rivers, dodge erupting volcanoes, and use a number of rocks to kill any land-based predators that get in his way. If he comes into contact with any of these, he will lose some energy, which can be restored by collecting fruit. Once Ug has taken all three eggs to his cave, he has to collect some wheels so that he can travel to the next island.</resource>

    <resource id="bf351bb0d73d609f99e92ee471046e84e302c137" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">In Centipede, the player is trapped in the Enchanted Forest. Armed with only a magic wand to ward off the forest's insect denizens, all of which apparently are attacking in the player in continuous waves. 

The player must use the magic wand to shoot sparks at approaching insects to score points by pressing the controller button. Holding down the controller button will set the wand to rapid fire shots. If the player is bitten by an insect, the player will be temporarily paralyzed and lose one of the three starting magic wands. 

Insect Opponents and Mushrooms
All enemy insects have a distinctive sound before attacking, which may help the player identify which insect is attacking. Enemies and objects in the game are as the following:

1. The Centipede
The Centipede will attack in 12 waves. In the first wave, the Centipede will have a head attached to 11 body segments. In the second wave, the Centipede will have a head attached to 10 body segments, in addition to a detached head. The third wave will have the Centipede with an attached head, 9 body segments, plus two detached heads. These body segments will transform into heads and continue to do so until Wave 12. In the last wave, the Centipede will have 12 detached heads, independently attacking the player. Centipede heads are worth more points than body segments.

Attacks from the Centipede will come from the top of the screen, moving downward. If a spark hits any part of the Centipede, that particular body segment will transform into a mushroom, while the body segment behind it will become the new Centipede head. When the Centipede is destroyed, it will briefly disappear and re-appear from the top of the screen again.

The Spider
The Spider will attempt to distract the player from attacking the Centipede. It will destroy any mushroom it touches. Spiders will score more points if it is hit in closer distances.

The Flea
The Flea will appear if the player has destroyed most of the existing mushrooms. It will drop down creating a new batch of mushrooms where it falls. The Flea will disappear after two hits. After the first hit, the Flea will drop down much faster.

The Scorpion
The Scorpion will appear in the third wave. It moves slowly but will pick up speed, moving faster. While doing so, it will poison any mushroom it touches.

Mushrooms
Mushrooms fill the Enchanted Forest and may act as obstacles or cover for the player, with added effects to enemy insects. It takes for shots to complete destroy a mushroom. There are two type of mushrooms: Magic Mushrooms and Poisonous mushrooms. Magic mushrooms are the default mushrooms in the game and are also the the result of the player destroying an insect or Centipede body segment. Poisonous Mushrooms are the result of the Scorpion touching a mushroom. Poisonous Mushrooms will prompt the Centipede near it to move straight towards the player through any mushroom. Losing a wand will restore any partially damaged mushroom.

Game Difficulty and Variations
The game offers four difficulty levels: Novice, Standard, Advanced, and Expert. Game Variations are as the following:

1. One Player
Two Player Alternating
Two players will take turns when the active player is bitten.
Dual Player Competition
Two players will appear on the screen at the same time. Scoring is separate. Shots fired from one player will paralyze the other player.
Team Play
Two players will appear on the screen at the same time. Scoring is combined. Shots fired from one player will not paralyze the other player.

Scoring
The player will win a bonus magic wand for every 12,000 points to a maximum of six wands. The game will end when all wands are lost. Scoring are as the following:

Centipede Head - 100 points
Centipede Body Segment - 10 points
Spider at close range - 900 points
Spider at medium range - 600 points
Flea - 200 points
Scorpion - 1,000 points
Flea - 200 points

In one player mode, the player must attempt to clear the table with a limited amount of shots which decreases everytime the player misses a shot or fouls. In two player mode, both players can play a game of snooker from 1 - 99 frames. There is also a tournament mode and it can either be played in knockout or league form with up to eight players able to play. Knockout has the players playing the best of five frames for each game while league is one frame.</resource>

One or two players race the 8 new tracks which once again are shown from an overhead view of the racetrack. There are some obstacles, like the whirlwind or oil-slicks, which should keep you from going around the track too easily. But Championship Sprint is not only an update with 8 new tracks. The main improvement is a complete track editor. With this you have the freedom to construct unlimited tracks, with all kind of obstacles and you even can set options like number of laps and number of players.</resource>

You are given a mission briefing before you start which gives information on the suspect and what car they drive. Then you drive across the city without crashing into other cars, and catch up with the criminal's car. To arrest the suspects, you must keep bumping into their car until it is no longer functional. And you have to do this under a strict time limit. You can't afford to crash into cars or buildings or you waste time getting on the road again. 

However, once you've caught up with your suspect, you are given more time. Your car is also equipped with turbo boosts, which you can use to gain extra speed if you are way behind the criminal. Each arrest is based on a &amp;quot;suspicion&amp;quot;.</resource>

To complete each screen you must collect the five blue crosses. Once you reach the mansion and find her, you must escort your girlfriend back through the same territories, switching between characters to collect the blue (him) and red (her) crosses as quickly as you can, still not safe.</resource>

There are four plate holders at the bottom of the screen and you pick a coloured plate up and place it on a pole with the colour of the plate having different points values. A white plate will give you the most points with a purple plate giving you the least but you can throw plates in the air and catch them to change colour. As you place plates on the poles the ones already spinning will start to slow down and have to be spun again to keep them spinning. Once all eight poles have a spinning plate on it then you move to the next level but it is game over if the timer reaches zero without eight plates spinning.</resource>

An ancient treaty between the United States and the Bungelings allows the U.S. to maintain a mail distribution center near where the hostages are being kept. You have smuggled an entire helicopter into the post office by disguising it as a mail sorting machine.

Suddenly you hear the sound of explosions. Looking out on the plain you see one of the Bungeling's barracks aflame. The hostages are running about frantically, desperate for a chance to escape. Bungeling planes and tanks are fast approaching lives may be lost. Your chopper is ready to go and fully armed - there is no time to waste.</resource>

Your car has broken down, miles from anywhere. Heading off in search of a gas station, 3 miles down the road you come upon what appears to be a Circus tent, nestled in a small valley. Sounds and music come from inside. As you reach the gate, suddenly there is complete silence. You walk fearfully towards the entrance of the tent, wondering what exactly is going on here. Maybe if you are lucky, you can find some gas here...

Around this time, the game engine was replaced with a far more powerful one. Now the games accepted complete sentences. You can hit ENTER to switch between graphics and all text. This made them somewhat easier to play and less frustrating.</resource>

The Greatest Show on Earth proudly presents...
Circus Games!

As a tiger trainer, you will have to put the tiger's through their various tracks. You have to do various stunts, like corkscrews and somersaults, on the trapeze.

As a tight rope walker, you need to go from one side to the other, doing handstands and somersaults along the way. There is also a lady daredevil that you do stunts with from the back of a horse.

If you do the international competition, you will have to do certain tricks for the trapeze, tight rope walker, horse trick-rider and make the tigers go through all the tricks in their routine.</resource>

On a planet that was thought to be uninhabited, an underground city complex has been discovered. The player's task is to explore this city with a remote-controlled hoverdrone, called Monitor, while trying to avoid its automatic defense systems.

Monitor is controlled from a top-down perspective and can only be moved into four directions, holding down the fire-button enables it to shoot in eight directions. There are various stationary and moving enemies that activate when Monitor gets close enough and start shooting when it moves. Some can shoot in four, others in eight directions, while others only try to ram the monitor or attack with homing shots.</resource>

Viewed from above, his challenge sees him having to progress through these worlds, collecting keys to gain access to different sections, and avoiding enemy balls and bugs by jumping them where possible. There are no 'lives' as such, but there's a strict time limit of around 400 seconds for the whole game, and death puts you back to the start of the level, with time lost as well. You get an extra 80 seconds for completing each level though.</resource>

It is similar to the Spectrum version, but features unique level designs and gameplay mechanics.

The player controls ultra-tough cop Cobra who must make his way through three side-scrolling levels: the cityscape, a rural area and a factory. Hordes of goons will try to kill him where he stands and attack with throwing knives, axes, grenades and guns. At the beginning, Cobra is unarmed and can only evade or punch out his enemies, but he can pick up weapon icons to increase his damage potential. Available are knives, grenades, a pistol and a machine gun (guns and ammo have to be collected separately). Ammunition for all weapons is limited. Cobra can refill his health by picking up hamburgers.

Not all that moves has to be killed: sometimes, innocent civilians cross Cobra's path. Shooting them will cost him a life. In levels one and three, Cobra also has to find fashion model Ingrid, then lead her along to the level exit.</resource>

The evil Toy Goblin is up to his old tricks, with his giant toy factory producing thousands of evil toys. In order to shut down the factory, Thing must travel through the factory's 11 different levels and  collect the tape, floppy disk, listing paper and ROM chip scattered throughout.

The levels are filled with slopes, conveyor belts, interconnected pipework (years before Sonic the Hedgehog), and lots of foes to avoid. Question mark times have variable effects: stepping onto them reveals bonus points, objects, or a large weight that squashes Thing flat. 

As Thing takes damage from enemies or weights, his oil level is reduced. When Thing runs out of oil, he becomes rusted and the game ends. To move between levels, Thing must enter the pipework through a vent and bounce around the pipes to find an exit.</resource>

As make your way through various levels you'll be given points for doing the right thing and deducted points for any missteps. You can record your attempts and review them, to spot your mistakes and learn from them.
Level one is the Physical course, which requires you to jump over walls, jump trenches and crawl under barbwire. Level two is the Risk course. This one will have you planting dynamite and throwing grenades.
Level three has the player going hand-to-hand in the Combat course. The fourth level combines the previous three levels into one, and finally, the fifth level is a custom &amp;quot;Cobra&amp;quot; course that throws random elements from all the courses at the player.
To give the game replay value, there is a course construction set so that you can make your own levels. The Atari ST and Amiga versions contain digitized sound.</resource>

The mission is to defend your bases against enemy attacks from the surrounding area. To do this, you have a whole range of weapons at your disposal: self-guided air-to-air missile, cannon and mines to drop. You also have to refuel.
The combat missions will occasionally give way to assistance missions to transport personnel and repatriate the wounded.
The map makes it easy to spot vehicles that blend in with the landscape, as well as making it easy to differentiate between allied vehicles.
Several difficulty levels keep the game going and help you forget some of the routine aspects of the missions.</resource>

You play as Nick, a motivated soldier (and Joe in 2 player mode) in search of a promotion.
You are therefore enrolled in the army, which imposes on you more or less difficult and varied tests. Some are penalizing and success is mandatory, others will be compensated by an additional traction test to make up for the defeat, some like arm wrestling do not impose any penalty. Among these events you will find obstacle jumping, shooting ranges, arm wrestling, fighting against the instructor, pull-ups and a beat them all sequence. The game is difficult, but the execution is quite neat.</resource>

    <resource id="039ed2354f121e6cca8ba6df50c61c34fd211a22" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">This is a puzzle game where you must explode all of the bombs on each level, using a spark.  The spark flows along a fuse, which is made up of a series of tiles.  These can be moved, in the manner of sliding puzzles, where there is only one gap, and tiles can be moved into the gap, creating a new gap.  The aim is then to move the tiles so the fuse forms a path from the spark to each bomb. 

There is a time limit, however, and extra time is knocked off if the spark reaches a dead end.  Also some levels contain water droplets, that extinguish the spark if they touch it.</resource>

The first race is in Brazil and features 100 cars, and requires you to finish in the top 80 in order to qualify for  next race. As you work through the 8 races the size of the field steadily decreases, but so does the worst acceptable finishing position to qualify.

The car has high and low gears, and is susceptible to damage from contact with another car. Once you hit a car or a piece of the trackside scenery you will be called into the pits - fail to make it back, or hit another car, and you will crash and lose several seconds.</resource>

The player takes control of a stockbroker on the fast track to riches. Suddenly, there are attempts on his life, with the words 'insider dealings' floating around.

The game is a text adventure with graphics; the player inputs verb commands to interact with the environment and advance the story. The gameplay focuses on realistic investigation and information-gathering rather than puzzle-solving.</resource>

Aliens can be shot, but every other hazard must be avoided, as contact with them or falling into holes costs valuable time.

Time left at the end of each level is added to the score. Hit the white blobs on the screen to earn credits, which can be used to purchase power-ups or tricks, which last only for the next level. Options include slowing down time, closing all black holes, deactivating the purple squares, and a shield.

Your race's robot has been infiltrated by your enemy to make it weaker so the other robot can destroy it. Taking control of a worker-droid called Cosmonut you have infiltrated your robot's head and you must find any enemy wandering around and destroy them. There are also various rooms that need sealing by completing various arcade games. Once you have sealed the rooms then you can enter the Central Control Room and make your robot stronger to finish off the other robot. All this has to be done before your robot loses all it's power.</resource>

It's a words-and-numbers game show, and the original format of 6 letters games, 2 numbers games and a conundrum, is recreated here. There is no computer opponent, so 2 people are required.

In the letters round, a selection of 9 letters is formed by alternately choosing a vowel or consonant, and the players have 30 seconds to find the longest available word. Generated letter combinations are not always realistic with the show. As in Computer Scrabble, the full dictionary is not stored in memory, so the game will ask if the words you enter are real. The longest word scores its length, with 18 points for a 9 letter word - both players score for equal length words.</resource>

To change the colour of a cube you must jump on it to change it and when all the cubes are changed then you move to the next level. On later levels you have to jump on a cube more than once to change it. As you jump from cube to cube there are creatures that move around the screen with the main bouncing balls bouncing from the top to the bottom increasing in numbers the further you progress. Snakes and various other creatures also make an appearance and these bounce in various directions around the screen and if you touch any creature then you lose one of five lives but the changed cubes stay changed. If you fall off the pyramid, as well as losing a life all the changed cubes change back. There are two discs on either side of the pyramid and when landed on take you to the top of the pyramid.</resource>

An attack has already been fought off and failed by Robin Hood and his Merry Men. With another attack taking place, Friar Tuck doesn't think this will be enough once again so he has arranged with the Bishop of Derby to carry out an exorcism. When the Bishop failed to show, Friar Tuck went searching for him but sadly came across his dead body holding a bloody parchment with a rhyme on it. Reading the rhyme, Friar tuck realises that it holds the clues to how to defeat and get rid of the Cult of Sagalia.</resource>

By 2022, the game was played not by humans, but two teams of seven robots. To spice things up, the usual pig skin ball was replaced with a 350 pound bomb.

Cyberball brings this fast and furious action to life. Gameplay is essentially the same as the real sport, although the 'downs' are replaced by the bomb's heat gradually increasing towards 'critical'. After this it will explode and possession will be swapped. This is prevented when you cross the 50-yard line, lose possession or score a touchdown, in which cases it resets to 'cool'. Field goals and punts are not featured - the only kick is the initial kick-off you receive.

Control passes from the quarterback (thrower) to the intended catcher as soon as a pass is released. The two-player game is co-operative - on offense one player passes and the other receives</resource>

In control of the deadly Cybernoid craft, your job is to rescue the cargo which has been stolen by a wave of pirate ships.

Using the range of weapon systems correctly is again a key factor. These include sideways aiming guns, bouncing bombs, 'seeker' smart bombs, bombs which move around th edge of the screen before finding a target, and time-sensitive bombs which explode a few seconds after you drop them. Shot pirate ships release cargo, and you must collect at least 1500 points of this, but on many screens it is more prudent to make an escape ASAP, as some screens have more hazards than others, and not all aliens on each screen act in the same way.</resource>

Cylu is viewed isometrically, and primarily consists of solving puzzles along the lines of many Ultimate Play the Game titles. Only five objects can be carried at a time, which means the route involves a lot of back-tracking. This is slightly lessened once you find some of the teleport bays, and the key to operate them.

There are 32 numbered forcefields around the game, and these must be deactivated by finding the appropriate silicon chip. Your droid requires regular re-fueling, either from canisters located in the early sections of the game, or from the RFL unit you can pick up later.</resource>

Basically you have to blast your way through or fly (jump) through treacherous terrain: water and bamboo sticks are one of many terrain types that can kill your character. Blasted monsters turn into 'bonus fruit' (yes, fruit) of which you can obtain for additional points. A unique attribute of DJ Puff is that you can modify the speed to a very wide range, therefore the current CPU speed can be modified to suit the player (from Zzzzz speed to Lightning speed).</resource>

Before you play the main events you have to train in the gym. Weight-lifting, squats and sit-ups are included, which involve waggling the joystick as fast as you can to fill a displayed bottle of Lucozade (clever bit of product-placement there). The better you do at this, the better you'll fare in the events, which are predominantly waggling-based as well. They include the standard decathlon events of running, jumping and throwing as well as you can. There are four types of shoes available, and choosing the wrong one for the event will seriously hamper your performance.</resource>

This task is not easy, as en route you will face heavy opposition forces. Fortunately, you won't be a sitting bomber in the air. Your aircraft is equipped with machine guns (left and right) with unlimited rounds of fire power, so fire at will as the enemy approaches.

When the time comes, you will have to bomb the target manually. So, get ready to unload the cargo and give them hell!</resource>

    <resource id="5fe3d57ef5b3220ea9ad791c79974b136b34ee20" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">In the third game in the Dan Dare series, Dan has been kidnapped by an evil alien race known as the Treens and taken to their scientific satellite orbiting Venus, but it doesn't take long before Dan breaks free and goes down into their ship. While searching it, he eventually finds an escape shuttle sitting in the launch bay, only to discover that it is out of fuel. He returns to the satellite in an attempt to find some.

The fuel cans are scattered around the five levels of the ship, which Dan can get to by using the Mekon's teleporters. To get to them though, Dan needs to destroy any Treen that gets in his way using a variety of weapons, bought by using a computer terminal. Along the way, the Mekon leader can be seen sitting around, and destroying him will more often than not reward Dan with a pod that he needs to access the teleporter. Dan can use his jet-pack to navigate the satellite, but this will eventually run out of fuel.</resource>

The bulk of the game is side-viewed, involving single screens to pass through, which incorporate ropes, cages and trapdoor. There are enemies walking, flying and hovering through this, and many of them respawn. Unusually your weapon to take them on (rocks) can be thrown through 360 degrees, which aims to make the gameplay more realistic and methodical. The screens were linked by hub screens, which the player passes through simply by clicking on a door.</resource>

    <resource id="9ddc8148b84bdb2d2af2677b29579ab8ead9fdcd" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">In Driller, the Ketars attempted to blow up the moon Mitral, but you stopped them. Now, they have Energy Collection Devices collectively known as EGOs, and hope to stock them up to use towards the Zephyr One device, and direct its energy at the planet Evath, resulting in a catastrophic radiation overload. 

Your mission is to beam onto their base on the moon Tricuspid, and destroy the EGOs. Destroying one will buy you more of your limited time. The problem is, many are connected to at least 2 others, and those can immediately regenerate, so you must tackle them in an order in which those with only 1 connection are attacked first.

You are inside a space suit, propelled by a Jet Pack with limited fuel, and possess lasers and a shield. Shield energy is limited, but can be recharged through pentagons and rods. In a world viewed through the the Freescape 3D system, you roam the verdant planet of trees, buildings and underground tunnels.

Gameplay has more action than Driller. The Freescape world has a third dimension - due to the jetpack you can leave the ground and look down on the view. You can also rotate the angle and make quick U-turns. You must leave the ground to shoot the active part of an ECD, but the jetpack uses energy at a faster rate, so use this feature sparingly. You must avoid Plexors, which weaken your shield, and deflector devices, which can beam you into prison.</resource>

    <resource id="b6cfa831b90ab8739f73b2c2d9b3cd7f3d2fb8fa" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Tom Cruise's film brought NASCAR racing to the masses, and Mindscape did the same for games players with this license. If you mentally change the driver names, it can be thought of as a recreation of real NASCAR racing rather than a direct recreation of the film. 

You play Cruise's Cole Trickle character (his name, like many of the others, is slightly different to that of a real NASCAR racer of the day) against your rivals on 8 tracks, based on real-life counterparts. The races are all on ovals, although the exact lengths, corner types and gradients are varied.  This means that the ideal racing line on one track can put you into the wall on another. Qualifying is incorporated alongside the races themselves.

From times to times you'll have to pull into the pit stop area. When doing so, you control the five members of the pit crew. Loosing time on pit will make you loose positions at the race. The other racers, however, never pit.

The NES version has 3rd-Person perspective only.</resource>

    <resource id="edad4d8ec3e4c8259a3fda48e07dfb90157497cd" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Deactivators is an arcade-puzzle maze game which puts you in control of a squad of bomb disposal droids. You must pick them up and quickly throw them out of the building to safety - failure to do this costs you a droid and a room (occasionally blocking off other essential rooms). The game's levels have grid-like arrangements with doors, trapdoors and poles, and increase in size as the game goes on. For both these reasons, mapping is essential.

Security droids are on patrol, but these can be tricked into falling down holes. A computer room is the hub of your activities - this allows you to use teleports and turn off force fields, via the appropriate circuit boards which are hidden throughout the levels. On later levels the gravity isn't constant and you will find rooms with distorted directional senses, increasing the precision required significantly.</resource>

Your fighter plane is armed with guns; a team of bombers are out there with you, with one always in front.

Initially you will face a few planes flying towards you. red planes shoot at you, and later there are black 'suicide planes' which aim to take you down Kamikaze style, and 'Blue Max' planes which are extra-tough.

After the first minute or so another challenge is added, in the shape of hills to fly around or over. After this, you reach the bombing zone, in which you guide the bombers behind you and instruct them which sites to bomb.

The game is viewed from the cockpit, with displays telling you of how much damage you and the bomber have taken, and whether you are steering in the right direction. A map is build in. The controls can be set in two ways, for 'up' on the joystick either equaling 'move upwards' or 'dive' (as on a real plane).</resource>

The Saxons and the Normans blame each other and fight for control of England.

After a short introduction by Robin of Locksley himself, you start the game with a single castle and 10 soldiers at your command. From there, you have to build your army, take control of additional territories and fight the three Norman lords - and sometimes your Saxon friends as well.

The game has several different styles: You may either engage in a jousting contest where you have to knock your opponent off his horse using a lance, you can go raid a castle for loot or you can attack another territory/castle.

The game was originally created on the Amiga platform in 1986 by Cinemaware with wonderful graphics by James D. Sachs and great music by Jim Cuomo, then ported to the PC whilst keeping its original appeal and quality.</resource>

    <resource id="f19dcbcde9f2b64fa8c89022ab286823eef2938a" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">The game begins after the warrior Stormlord's victory over the demonic invasion in the first game. The evil Black Queen is gone, but her surviving followers combine their powers and capture all the fairies again. Now, Stormlord has to rescue the fairies for the second time, fighting his way through six levels from the depths of Hell all the way to Heaven.

Similar to the first Stormlord game, there are fairies to free and monsters to mash all the while avoiding the platform traps. However, the game becomes more of an action sideways game. The game is divided into three levels divided into two sections each, with bosses and bonus levels in the end of each. All of the original's action-adventure gameplay elements are absent in the sequel.</resource>

It's set in the Delta region of space, in which the Hsiffan Khanate species have a powerful presence, using their technology to steal and analyze Terran ships.

The 32 levels each feature different static hazards, as well as the actual Hsiffan forces, which come at you in programmed attack patterns. Your default ship isn't strong enough to survive half of these, so in time-honored tradition power-ups are available via a credit system. The more credits you have, the more blue tokens (offering weapons) are offered - if you don't have many, fatal-to-touch grey tokens are unleashed.</resource>

You have an energy bar which decreases when you are hit and when it is empty then you lose one of three lives. The castle itself is made up of numerous rooms and ladders can be climbed up or down to reach new parts of the castle. Occasionally you will come a cross a demon blocking a route and you must fight them to kill them to move onwards. The demon also has an energy bar which you need to empty to kill him. A part of the castle is a maze with many identical looking rooms that needs to be navigated in your quest to rescue Alicia.</resource>

The player takes the role of tank commander Lone Wolf who has to foil Rommel's plans in Northern Africa. The strategic part of the game plays on a overhead map which shows Lone Wolf and Rommel's positions. The overall goal is to save the Allied depots which are attacked by Rommel's troops - the main challenge is to save all of them in time. Lone Wolf can be moved over the map and one airstrike per game can be used to buy time for one depot. Lone Wolf also has the ability to gain enemy intel with his radio - this is useful in order to find out where obstacles await.

Whenever Lone Wolf runs into one of these obstacles or Rommel, one of five action sequences starts. This includes tank duels, a turret section against incoming fighters, navigating a minefield, protecting a convoy and escaping an ambush. Those action sequences can also be played separately from the campaign. Lighting conditions change depending on the time of day.</resource>

The aim of the game is to gather information and clues from around the house, solve the case, and implicate the murderer.

When Snide is in the vicinity of an item of interest, the border will flash. Pressing Fire on the joystick brings up a menu of six commands. Some of these commands allow you to examine, manipulate, and utilize objects; or check the time. Players can only carry six objects at a time, unless they already have something to carry them in.

People roam around the mansion, and players can interrogate them by bringing up the menu and choosing the Question icon. The characters will stop what they are doing, and the player must face them in order to interrogate them. Players can question them about MacFungus, objects, or other characters.

Every once in a while, a murder takes place involving one of the characters. Players have to collect the necessary evidence and accuse the murderer before time runs out.</resource>

While an action/adventure hybrid using this license was released by Disney for the PC and Amiga, Titus also held a license to the movie.

Each stage leads to one of the mob bosses, until you ultimately capture the big man himself.</resource>

Stopping you from doing this are two monsters, called Pooka and Fygar, who will continually chase you around. The only weapon that you carry is an air pump, which you can use to inflate the monsters to the point where they explode. (if you start to inflate them but stop doing so, the monsters will get turned back to their normal selves.) Furthermore, rocks are scattered throughout the earth, and you can use these rocks to squash them. If the monsters do not find you for several seconds, they will eventually get turned into ghosts, which are able to walk through the earth. They are invincible and cannot be killed. From time to time, vegetables will appear in the center, and you can get these for points.</resource>

The gameplay involves collecting items and moving to other locations where the item is required; for example, at one point a raincoat is needed to protect against damaging rain. This is made more difficult because only one item can be carried at any given time.

Unlike later games in the series, which focus more on the inventory-based puzzles, this game features a very large number of hazards that kill the player on contact. With only three lives initially to complete the game, this makes it a very difficult game to complete by today's standards.</resource>

You start with a fixed amount of cash. As you play and get winning combinations, you'll have to choose whether to collect or gamble what you've won. After completing the fruit machine game, you'll get the chance to play a dice game where you have to guess if the next throw will be higher or lower than the current one. 

Dizzy Dice features two game modes. The first one you play as a normal fruit machine. But then there also is the bank mode, where you start with $20 and need to reach $100 to break the first bank. In total there is five banks, each requiring more cash to win. The game is controlled using the keyboard.</resource>

Hidden in the bushes is Rockwart the Troll and his gang of Henchtrolls who confront the heroes. Floating besides them in the water is an old apple barrel, so jumping in they start a journey down the rapids looking for safety. As they float down the river, Dizzy must avoid various other creatures and obstacles as touching them will lose one of three lives. There are also dragons firing cannons on bridges and mini hurricanes which send Dizzy in another direction. Dizzy can throw apples at the creatures but these are limited but are replenished after dying. The game is viewed in front of Dizzy at an elevated angle as the screen scrolls vertically when Dizzy moves. Two players can play on screen at the same time but the screen will only scroll when the last player moves.</resource>

As the lavishly-drawn comic bundled with the game explains, Spider-Man and Captain America must join forces to go to Latveria and foil his plans.

The main action in the game is a side-scrolling beat 'em up, in which you alternately control the two characters. They each have their own moves to deal with The Rhino, Electro and other foes. Moves are context-sensitive based on the distance between your character and the opponent. Energy bars decrease as you each take hits. After each section you get comic-book sequences as a reward, and to set the scene of the evolving story.</resource>

You're in control of a small spaceship and have once again to save the earth from alien attack. You have to maneuver your craft through small passages while under permanent attack.
The first level is a vertical shooter level with your ship only in its basic configuration. The later levels are horizontal scrolling and there you get your chance to improve your efficiency by collecting various power up ranging from speed-ups to tail cannons.
Typically, each stage has a final boss who needs a lot of firepower to be beaten.

The first job is to guide the Amquack Express around a top-down map with 8 stations, setting the junctions to ensure that packages are delivered to the correct stations. His job in produce involves catching fruits as they are thrown at him and placing them in the correct basket. At the toy store he must sort items by shape and colour, and be careful with the security switch. His final job is at an internal US airport, soring products based on their location's delivery code.

The equipment for the playground must then be purchased and arranged, helping young minds get an appreciation of money management and cash-handling.</resource>

    <resource id="88bd48237e8eb4d2589b3477d432891bd9ee7566" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Released in the arcades in 1981, Donkey Kong was not only Nintendo's first real smash hit for the company, but marked the introduction for two of their most popular mascots: Mario (originally &amp;quot;Jumpman&amp;quot;) and Donkey Kong.

Donkey Kong is a platform-action game that has Mario scale four different industrial themed levels (construction zone, cement factory, an elevator-themed level, and removing rivets from girders) in an attempt to save the damsel in distress, Pauline, from the big ape before the timer runs out.  Once the rivets are removed from the final level, Donkey Kong falls, and the two lovers are reunited.  From there, the levels start over at a higher difficulty.

Along the way, Mario must dodge a constant stream of barrels, &amp;quot;living&amp;quot; fireballs, and spring-weights.  Although not as powerful as in other future games, Mario can find a hammer which allows him to destroy the barrels and fireballs for a limited amount of time.  Additionally, Mario can also find Pauline's hat, purse and umbrella for additional bonus points.

Donkey Kong is also notable for being one of the first complete narratives in video game form, told through simplistic cut scenes that advance the story.  It should also be noted that in versions of the game for early 1980's consoles, Donkey Kong only used 2-3 of the original levels, with the cement factory usually omitted.</resource>

The Dragons must now embark on a mission to avenge her death and defeat the Black Warriors for the second and final time.

The original arcade version of &amp;quot;Double Dragon II&amp;quot; was essentially an improved version of the first game. In addition to offering renewed audio and visuals, as well as new traps, moves and enemy characters, &amp;quot;Double Dragon II&amp;quot; discarded the conventional punch and kick buttons in favor of a direction-oriented attacking system similar to the original Technos beat-em-up Renegade.

The NES version offered new stages, new moves and illustrated cut-scenes, as well as a new final boss and a new ending. Unlike the first NES game, it offered 2-Player Co-Op gameplay with the option to turn off the friendly fire.</resource>

The game style is principally a platformer which finds the player running and jumping through various screens, numbering around a hundred. Many of the rooms include enemies which generally follow fixed paths but may also swarm and chase the player. The player starts the game with two weapons: fire breath which is limited but may be replenished by collecting items, and a punch which is unlimited. Once destroyed, enemies do not respawn except in the C64 version, where they can respawn if a room that was only partly cleared is revisited.</resource>

This leads to six levels of horizontally-scrolling shoot ‘em up action, although with some vertical movement as well.

The thing which sets the game apart from every other horizontally-scrolling shoot ‘em up (except Saint Dragon) is that you are riding on the back of a dragon, called Bahamoot. Both you and the dragon have firepower, and holding down the fire button increases Bahamoot’s energy bolt’s ferocity. The dragon’s tail can be controlled indirectly, and because it is indestructible, it can be used either as a shield, or as a weapon in its own right. 

There are power-ups to collect by dismounting from the dragon and walking into them. These include fiery breath, bolts shot from Bahamoot’s tail, homing missiles of sorts, and lightning bolts, with only one ever active at a time. Each level has a time limit.</resource>

The President kidnapped? Without a moments hesitation you know who's responsible - the Dragon Ninja. As Blade or Striker, a.k.a. THE BAD DUDES you take to the streets to rescue the President from his clutches.
But the Dragon Ninja is ready foryou. He sends wave after wave of relentless ninjas, vicious dogs, and enemies to stop you. Armed with knives, shurikens and numchucks you must fight tooth and nail in alleys, on waterways, even on moving semi-trucks. And don't think that once you've wiped out an advancing ninja horde you're safe. The Dragon Ninja has surprises up his sleeve. When you least expect it, you will find yourself face to face with any number of super monsters.
In the end, if you're BAD enough, you take on the Dragon Ninja himself. You must defeat him and snatch the President from the helicopter that's about to whisk him away to who-knows-where.</resource>

It's now up to the heroic warrior Amul to transform himself into a blue dragon and go and rescue the princess.
Dragon Spirit is a vertically scrolling shoot-em-up which consists of nine stages. Players fly around and destroy everything in their path. Much like in Xevious, action takes place on two planes, both in the sky and on the ground. The dragon has two different kind of attacks: fire that shoots up the screen, and fire that drops to hit a place on the ground in front of the dragon. Enemies exist both in the air and on the ground, and some can fly up from the ground to the sky.
Players can pick up power-ups, or upgrades, that will help them in their fight. Upgrades can include extra heads on the dragon, health, faster shots, and more. At the end of each stage is a boss that needs to be defeated. Having good upgrades that are not lost from being hit before reaching the bosses will help.</resource>

The player starts with a party of four in the city of Purgatory, equipped with nothing more than.. well - nothing. Worst of all your magic users won't help you out, either, because magic has been banned (to correct this unpleasing situation is one of your main objectives). 
Other main targets are surviving, getting out of Purgatory and toppling Namtar (maybe getting some decent clothing, one or two shiny swords and the like on your way out).

Gameplay instantly reminds of the Bard's Tale series. Step-by-step first person 3D, opponents materialize out of the air. The combat system is turn based.

Unlike its (spiritual?) predecessors the game features a full-blown skill system, auto-mapping and many places to actually use all these abilities.
Reasonable distribution of your skill points is rather critical.</resource>

The game, as one would expect from the long-running Dragon's Lair series, has mixed gameplay, including platform, puzzle and arcade (in the old-fashioned choose-your-path sort of way).

This first port includes two adventures: the first is to raid the lair of Singe the Dragon (hence the classic name) and rescuing Princess Daphne, and the second, in a sort of instant sequel of the first chapter, features Dirk trying to escape from the castle, now overrun by the Lizard King and its minions.</resource>

Dirk, having rescued the fair Princess Daphne, decides to go back through the Dragon's Lair and relieve Singe of some of the gold that is in the castle which is under the protection of the cunning and lethal Lizard King. You will need lightning reflexes and judgement to fight the Lizard King and avoid the giant rolling marbles.

In this adventure you will be rushed down rapids in a barrel and sent down corridors on a magical flying horse and other dangerous deeds will present problems for you. Finally, direct Dirk to freedom through the realm of the mud monsters who come alive from the very earth itself to enslave Dirk and turn him into mud like themselves, navigate the dangerous terrain and jump across the chasm and freedom is yours.</resource>

Scientist.
Researcher.
And somewhat of a visionary.
Until now, you have led your life as a hermit. But a lot has happened, and your life has changed. You can no longer afford to seek the peace and solitude you once enjoyed. For there is much to be done.
But, you are not alone. You have your friend Hawkwind. He knows the terrain of Simbala, for he is the leader of that great country. And, in light of what has just happened, you'll need his help and guidance.
The Last Dragon has been kidnapped. The message came to you through the mystical Dragonpearl. It can tell of the past and predict the future. And though the image in the Dragonpearl is clouded with mystery, the message it conveys is clear: The Last Dragon is being held captive deep in the Southland of Simbala. Only you and Hawkwind can save him. The bond of friendship shared by the three of you permits you to do nothing less. It won't be easy. But then again, you and Hawkwind would struggle to the death to save the Last Dragon.
Dragonworld is the first fantasy adventure game written by the authors of a bestselling fantasy novel. You'll be able to travel through three vast and varied geographical regions. And all along the way, you'll encounter fascinating mysteries and dangerous challenges.</resource>

The corporations can control dream demons to defeat their foes, but resistance fighters still defy them. The player is one of these resistance fighters hoping to rescue some friends from the control of Ocular, the mightiest of all dream demons.

Gameplay is somewhat reminiscent of Xenophobe, with the player moving through side-scrolling, space-station-like environments shooting at an endless onslaught of strange creatures. By making good use of power-ups and gaining access to new levels, the player can eventually find Ocular, which can only be defeated if all six of its eyes are shot closed.</resource>

The game, originally written for the 8-bit Ataris, is basically a Defender clone, but popular because it so closely recreates the gameplay of the original Defender, with its speedy scrolling and frantic gameplay.

The player is a spaceman with a jet-pack, flying across a barren landscape whose skies are inhabited by a number of different aliens; from the simple Planter to the slowly advancing Blunder Storm or the quick, aggressive Nemesite. 

Planters and Nemesites will try to pickup the small men walking on the surface, who must then be rescued. You must shoot down the alien, while avoiding to hit the man. Sometimes, the aliens will carry an android, which is similar to the human but deadly. Care must be taken so as to not pick up the androids. All men must be transported to a surface base, where they are put in safety. This is the Dropzone.</resource>

The game is presented in a top-down view. The druid walks around the terrain seeking out the staircase that leads to the next level. On the way, he is harassed by hordes of monsters that come out of every direction and attack him, decreasing his health. To defend himself, the druid can use the spells of water, fire or electricity to toss projectiles. However, these magical weapons have limited ammo. 

The druid also has three other magical spells at his disposal - an invisibility spell which prevents the monsters from automatically approaching him, a golem spell which summons a helpful golem (which can be controlled by a second player), and a skull spell which destroys all on-screen enemies. The druid also carries around keys which open locked doors. But all these have very limited supplies. 

On his way, the druid finds many shops. Each such shop contains some keys or charges for the druid's spells, but the druid can only pick one item from each shop. 

The druid can also come across a pentagram on the ground which will restore his lost health.</resource>

The aim of the game is shown in the introduction. Flintheart Glomgold challenges Scrooge to a competition to see who the richest duck in the world is. They each have 30 days to see who can get the most money together and finally their dispute will be settled.

Scrooge's office is your headquarters. Here you have three options – you can go exploring for treasure, play the stock market or dive into your money bin, occasionally finding a rare coin which adds to you treasure total. You need to get some money first before you can play the stock market though.</resource>

    <resource id="cd889ff6f5597af98e86872b07961aee58909bdf" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">The game starts where Dan lands his airship on the top of the evil Dr Blitzen's hideout. The aim of the game is to find eight sticks of dynamite that are placed randomly around the playing area whilst avoiding the perils of the game such as moving monsters, drowning and falling from great heights. Once Dan has all eight sticks of dynamite, the player must make their way to the central safe to blow it open and steal the plans for the evil doctor's Death Ray and escape to his airship.

The playing area is essentially one large building split up into multiple screens that wrap around a central elevator. Each screen contains a number of moving monsters that, once the player moves into them, are destroyed but take off a life in return. The only exception to being destroyed once walked into are Dr Blitzen and his assistant Donner (Donner and Blitzen) who are both located on the same screen as the safe. Other perils to Dan's life include running out of energy (caused by not collecting enough food, falling from heights and being hit by laser beams). If Dan should also fall into the underground river that flows beneath the building, the player will receive a game over unless Dan had picked up Oxygen, in which case they will be sent back to the start of the game.

Once completed, the game gives you a secret code to decipher and a number to call once you have the answer. While the number no longer works now, the prize was a ride in the Mirrorsoft blimp.

A sequel, Dynamite Dan 2, was released the following year which featured around 200 rooms.

The background music when choosing the game settings and waiting for the game to start is the third movement (Rondo Alla Turca) from Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's Piano Sonata No. 11 in A major, K. 331.</resource>

Being able to use direct-combat moves as well as collecting bonus weapons, and food for energy recharging, is pretty typical as well. Games of this type that were converted from the arcade to home computers are particularly commonplace - Renegade and the Double Dragon series are famous examples.

Where this one stands out, however, is the setting of your character as a duck called Bin (and his red buddy Pin), and with motion having a clear waddling appearance. The enemies to fight are all from the animal kingdom, but somewhat warped - crocodiles with boxing moves and cows armed with rocket packs for example. Bin has six levels to clear before he can rescue Lucy from Achacha's clutches.</resource>

The player adopts the identity of an ancient Chinese warrior, and riding on horseback has to eliminate all his opponents, mostly infantry and archers.

The game uses a lateral scroll and the player can move in all four directions. A novelty is the attack system: when pressing fire the energy of the attack will load up as the warrior moves his spear up and backwards, in order to gain momentum. The more the player can keep fire pressed, the more powerful the attack will be.

The game spawned a sequel in the arcades, &amp;quot;Warriors of fate&amp;quot;, and is not to be confused with the PSX game of the same title, which is a one-on-one fighting game.</resource>

You control a spacecraft situated on a globe which you can rotate and move around the screen. You must knock globes into others of the same colour, to rid the screen of all the globes. The screen has no borders, so globes can be pushed off the side of the screen, increasing your tactical range. Knocking globes of different colors into each other produces smaller pods which need to be picked up quickly, giving you energy, or they will turn into globes and you will have to get rid of them too. Many of the globes are linked to other globes (or the ship) via string, and the level layouts include barriers as obstacles (and ricochet points), making the Newtonian physics more complex.</resource>

It focuses on the commercial aspects of space flight, as opposed to governmental or military aspects.

In the near future of the year 1996, you have been appointed space director. Your goal is to build space stations, conduct research, market products, and compete against up to three other directors. These can be controlled either by the computer or by other players. There are various missions with distinct objectives: the tasks range from rescue operations, pure research or space colony construction to a search for intelligent extraterrestrial life.

In the course of the game, you can build 39 different modules, including command, life, chemical lab, solar collector, and communications. Most of the missions require special units: for a Mars rescue operation, you first need to build a space hospital, for example. It's also possible to launch shuttles and probes from the station.

Reaching the goals of each scenario requires money. You can sell new products, request help from commercial sponsors, and even use ads to attract more buyers. To make this game even more challenging, you constantly have to watch your opponents, because if any of them achieves the goal first, you lose.</resource>

Like most child-oriented licenses of the day, his first computer outing was a platform game, scrolling vertically and resembling Rainbow Islands, although much simplified.

Edd must progress up the levels within the time limit (water will come up to drown him - presumably polluted water through which a duck can't swim), while collecting every star. Bad guys can be stunned by shooting them, which makes them safe to touch, although nothing other than Edd actually dies. The levels are all themed around particular areas of the BBC offices, including a sci-fi set and the weather room.</resource>

You must pass through the pairs of gates and hit the single ones, remain on the course, and avoid trees and spectators. Offences such as these will cause you to accrue penalty points, which will detract from your score. Up to 5 players can attempt these, with their results compared at the end.</resource>

You start off attempting to jump oil barrels on a bicycle, with the bigger feats of jumping a motorbike over cars come later.

You get no speedometer to help you judge speeds, but you can learn to gauge exactly how the bike handles and what it can do.

You can position the start of your run-up, with wind needing to be factored in as an affect on the distance. Wheelies can be practices on the approach ramp. The further on you land, the better the score.

Unfortunately, on Halloween the dead wake up in the castle. And to make matters worse, Elvira's great-great-grandmother Emelda, who died 100 years ago, also wants to return to the realm of the living to seize world domination.
To prevent this, Elvira hires a ghost hunter whose role is taken over by the player.</resource>

    <resource id="3a959127fb5c2c4e33099638ca7fec099e30a9aa" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Elvira - a horror movie star, a witch, and your girlfriend - is in trouble. A demon Cerberus has kidnapped her in order to kill her and gain her power. To save Elvira, you arrive at the studios of Black Widow Productions, where she is being held. Unfortunately, the whole studio is filled with monsters, as the horror movie sets have turned real.

Elvira II: The Jaws of Cerberus is an adventure/RPG first-person game. You begin by choosing one of the four classes for your character (which determines your starting attributes, such as Strength, Intelligence etc.).

For movement, you click the arrows in the bottom-right corner of the screen. Collecting items can be done via clicking on them in the first-person view window and dragging them into your inventory. (You can also click the &amp;quot;room&amp;quot; icon to see all the items that you've found in the room so far.) Should you encounter monsters, you fight by clicking on them. You can choose one of the four tactics (Normal, Defense, Fierce, Berserk) when fighting, and there's a number of different weapons you can find in the game. If you meet someone who doesn't want to murder you (a very rare occurrence) you can talk to him, though conversations are pretty simple and consist mainly of short phrases.

As you defeat monsters, explore the game world and cast spells (see below), you get experience. Once you have enough experience, you gain a level, and your attributes improve.

Thanks to Elvira's spellbook she gave you, you have the ability to create and cast spells. Some spells can be used to heal yourself, protect you in combat or damage your enemies, other are necessary to solve certain puzzles and make progress in the game. Creating a spell requires you to be of high enough level and to have the proper ingredients, different for every spell. The ingredients are usually gone forever once the spell is ready, so beware and don't use up any items vital for completing the game! Casting a spell requires you to use some amount of Power Points (PP), which regenerate automatically but slowly. What's more, you only get a limited number of castings when you prepare a spell, so don't waste them.</resource>

The wide range of facilities and control options have between designed in such a way that you can sit down and play without hours spent studying the manual, and getting to grips with the controls. One or two can play, whether against each other, or against the computer. You can even watch two computer teams playing each other! Player skill levels and fitness levels vary, so picking the right team is just as important as the way you control your players during the game.
Fixture lists, results, and league tables may be displayed at any time during the season, and if you have a Commodore or compatible printer you can even print them out as a permanent record.

    <resource id="33a69d1f4baec53802adb3505925b28d307a9fb0" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">In this game you play the role of an endurance bike racer. The gameplay involves you racing against the clock to get to the finish line and jumping over ramps. At the end of each race you get points for how many cars or bikes you have overtaken with which you can upgrade your bike.
There are various different terrain for you to race on including desert beach and dirt tracks plus a number of things to slow you down or even knock you off of your bike all together. The main idea is to find the best route through each level to shave off valuable seconds in order to over take more cars and bikes.

The Japanese version of the game has more Tracks than the European and US versions have. Among  them is a snow track which is one of the hardest tracks in the game, because there is a lot of stones on the thin road.</resource>

I could hardly belive it at first, but there before my very eyes was the key I had been searching for. The Eye of Osoris, yet there was something strange and unfamiliar about the symbol, something I had never seen in my travels throughout Egypt. It was as though the Eye had been here many thousands of years, before both the Sphinx under which it was positioned, and the great Pyramids ever existed. As I intensely examined the Eye, it became clear that it was not made of an Earthly substance and therefore confirmed my theory of its extra-terrestial origins. Whilst I pondered over my astounding find, I suddenly became aware of a low pitched humming sound which appeared to come from beneath the vey ground.</resource>

Worse still, the security system of defence droids is active, and primed to damage anything which attempts to penetrate the surface. 

As such, you are in control of a Dedicated Disposal Droid in, which must eventually shut down the security system and clear the area of radioactive material. This is done by throwing it down the disposal chute on each of the 8 levels, but you only have limited time before they explode. Fuel is limited and must be found within the complex, with the retro-thrust move using it up particularly quickly. To reach the next level you must find the appropriate pass.</resource>

Another wave, and a second shape appears on a table nearby. The player now decides whether or not the two shapes match.

If not, Ernie shakes his head &amp;quot;no&amp;quot;, waves his wand, and a new shape appears on the table.</resource>

Before each match the player is shown each team's Goal Scoring Ability, which gives them some idea of how a match is likely to unfold. Full European rules on disciplinary points are included, as are away goals and penalty shoot-outs to decide ties which are level after the 2 matches.</resource>

The game has a demonstration mode and seven scenarios of increased difficulty with the highest level allowing you full control of the train, with all the gauges to watch, more problems that arise and a random timetable to follow. You start at a standstill in the station and must get your train moving. Different levels of speed must be maintained on the track to keep with the speed limits that are placed on the track and keep an eye on the signals that you will see on the way. The correct use of the whistle must be used and you have to make sure your water, steam and coal levels are correct to make sure you keep to the timetable. The game is viewed from a first person perspective with you in the cab of the train with all the levers and gauges in front of you. You are able to see into the distance in front of you and the sides. As well as the main playing area you can also see your speed, water and coal level, any signals, gradient (slope) indicator and the time.</resource>

Your task is to progress from left to right in each level, either along the ground or by using the arrangement of platforms. Most of the baddies can be avoided rather than shot, and this is often easier, especially as you can duck or jump to avoid them. As well as a standard gun (activated by tapping fire) you also have a limited number of missiles to take out installations (activated by holding down fire, which makes autofire facilities useless). The scrolling is flick-screen, perhaps as the game was designed for the C64, and the Amiga version was identical to the ST's.</resource>

Sixteen different moves are on offer, ranging from standard kicks to jumps, somersaults and roundhouse kicks.

The move executed each time is defined based on the character's direction, the joystick/keyboard positioning, and on whether the fire button is depressed, in a system which became standard on single-button control systems.

To win each bout you must score 2 Yin-Yangs - a perfectly executed kick/punch scores a full one, whereas a less forceful contact offers half a point - the best moves also offer more points. In the one-player game, you advance through a Dan by winning two successive bouts, and a single win for the opponent means game over. The champion in a two-player duel is decided by points after 4 rounds.</resource>

Your character has plenty of attacking kicks and punches to use on anyone who gets in his way, starting with the local banker, and then some coyotes roaming the plains, who are easier dodged than killed. After this, you find yourself atop the train, attacking a succession of guards in one-on-one beat ‘em up duels, each of which must be won outright within the time limit to avoid losing a life. Many of these shoot at you, so dodge their shots as you attack them. The game offers a practice mode, in which you have 32 lives to try to improve your skills, and a ‘normal’ mode in which you have unlimited continues as long as you can reach the high-score table with each continue – in this mode, as in the ‘advanced’ mode in which you must always start again from scratch, you have 5 lives</resource>

These aren't average bugs; Chicago is under siege from mutated insects, rats and even toy tanks.

You'll have to work through seven houses, each of which has the typical rooms. You control a seemingly-dismembered hand, which must deal with the hordes as they come towards it, into the screen. They can be shot, thumped, or squashed depending on their type. To clear a room you must kill a certain number of creatures in each of the vertically-divided 'lanes' of the room - this causes squares on the ground to change colour.</resource>

This was essentially a spare-time pet project, so you would expect some of the most advanced graphics and special effects you'll ever see on a Spectrum.

The first level involves flying around in a ship shooting out aliens, with contact depleting your energy (and causing the screen border to flash). The second section involves travelling underwater, running into landmines to set off explosions to kill surrounding enemies. The final part sees you travelling through a  building in a huge droid, taking out everything in your path. The game is quite short, and would take around 20 minutes to play through.</resource>

When you have accumulated enough flight experience, you may command entire squadrons in the fictional Operation Conquest campaign, a simple simulation of an entire war theater that already hinted at what would later become DI’s Virtual Battlefield.

Cup Football is officially licensed by the English F.A, and lets you lead your English club side to the FA Cup victory. First you have to select your team and how many players will play the game (maximum is 8). You can select formation and between 3 different game strategies, which are: attacking, balanced and defensive. Sometimes you have to answer to some questions where you have 3 choices. For example, if your player wants to leave the club, what would you do?

Like in the real F.A Cup, your opponent will be decided by a random draw. Before each match you will see your next opponent. In the game you'll see all the fixtures, and watch how the matches are going minute by minute. If your team wins, you continue to the next round (unless it was the final). Drawn matches result in replays; at this time infinite replays were used rather than penalty shoot outs. Random events such as player injuries or off-pitch problems often occur before replays.</resource>

Players fly a jet across a looping area and must shoot down attacking aircraft. A small radar at the bottom of the screen shows the enemies' position. Fuel and rockets are limited, but there are several landing platforms where the jet can be refueled and resupplied. Before the jet is able to land however, it needs to be brought to a full halt right above the platform, leaving it vulnerable to attacks. Landing platforms can also be destroyed if they are bombed or enemy planes crash into them. As the game progresses, enemies attack in increasingly large and difficult waves.</resource>

Dizzy sets off to rescue her, braving dragons, rats and alligators along the way. The lands are littered with coins, and as well as completing the main task you should aim to collect as many of these as possible. There are puzzles on most screens, involving collecting objects such as keys, food and water buckets, and using them on doors, flames and such. Unlike the first two game, dialogue boxes between Dizzy and various other characters are included, giving the game a sense of character and humor as well as guiding you through the puzzles somewhat.</resource>

The rightful leaders of the country have called you in to destroy Fernandez's hideouts and bring his country back to the people.

Fundamentally this is a Commando clone, scrolling vertically and with hordes of enemies to be taken on, with finding good shielding spots and launching surprise attacks an especially useful strategy.You have unlimited bullets and limited but collectible grenades to use. There are landmines to avoid, and medical packs to pick up.

On each of the 8 levels you must destroy Fernandez's buildings, which are accessed through an underground network of tunnels. You're not limited to being on foot - you start off in a jeep and can also use motorbikes, tanks and similar, although losing a life destroys this. In 2-player mode you can split driving and gunning duties. When starting a new game, you always start from the point at which you died in the last game.</resource>

Collecting herbs to cast spells is the main basis of the game. There are 24 herbs and flowers to be collected, which are used to make one of 12 spells (the herbs are only used for 1 spell, so there’s no need to decide which spell you’d prefer to have access to). You can use a combination of the spells (including a teleporter, invisibility and a fireball, which you must work our how to use). Leanoric’s direction relative to yourself is indicated by a compass.</resource>

Only one small nebula remains, but while making the intergalactic jump, the Orion is taken over by an alien race known as the Zimen.

In an attempt to get rid of the Zimen, the players control four robots - Captain Slog, Plot the Navigator, Engineer Knut, and Able Spaceman Bodd - which they use one at a time. Each robot is situated in different areas of the ship. Some robots can easily navigate their way through the maze of 230 rooms, while others are temporarily trapped in their rooms.

When a robot comes into contact with the Zimen, its energy is quickly drained. When all of its energy is depleted, the robot will stop functioning, and the only way it can be restored is if a passing robot transfers its energy with the non-functional one.

The Zimen materializes suddenly in the Orion's passageways with deadly persistance, and can easily trap the outnumbered crew into a corner. To help them, the robots can throw bouncing bombs at the Zimen, gaining points when they have been destroyed. 

Control panels scattered throughout the ship give a robot access to code screens. When decoded, these will unlock matter-transmitters and lifts, meaning that the robot crew can move through the ship and closer to the ultimate goal: locking into the Bridge Computer. When all four have done this, the Orion will be safe.</resource>

    <resource id="d7a4190121f51594dcb0b3cfeae7b1a7b3ff1efe" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Final Blow is an action game based around the sport of boxing. You can play the fighters in a sequence of knock-out competitions, (the computer versions also include a round-robin league). Rounds last one minute, with a short break in between them. As in the real sport, your aim is to knock your opponent down for 10 seconds, by gradually weakening him with a series of punches. You can block punches, to avoid them inflicting damage onto you. The ring is of a limited size, so players can be cornered, although the referee will intervene to break the boxers up if they become entangled in a stalemate position.

The genesis version is not to be confused with the Master System game of the same name, which is entirely different.</resource>

Either way, the gameplay is platform-based, with enemies floating around to rob you of energy on contact. There are also scrolling mazes to move through. As you collect objects (often by using some of the other items you collect, to create chemical reactions of sorts and adding an element of lateral thinking), you must try to trade them for the most valuable items you can get.</resource>

The framework is represented as a grid of squares or sectors. Ultimately you must reach and destroy the power source, at the far right of the grid, whilst at the start of the game you only have access to the 'dead zone', at the far left of the grid, and those squares immediately adjacent. This can be extended as described below.

Planetary sectors are systems with planets in them, and cannot be entered as they are the enemy's main colonies, so are too well defended. Thus they block the path.

Unconstructed regions can be taken over, turning them into part of the dead zone, by bypassing the 'instrusion detection' alarm system. The system involves the cursor flicking between 'thumbs up' and 'thumbs down' symbols, and you must press fire when 'thumbs up' is displayed to take over the system. A thumbs down will scramble the squares on the grid.</resource>

You'll also rescue other people trapped inside. Your mission becomes difficult by falling objects and fireballs, and even the flames shoot sparks in any direction at any time.

You can use the water spray on the flames to distinguish them. Doing so will occasionally reveal cash and other special items, which include: the 3-way water spray, which allow you to extinguish flames north, east, and west of you; invincibility, to make you invincible for a few seconds; and speed, which boosts you up several floors. 

You start the game with four lives. You'll lose any one of these lives by coming in contact with fire and falling objects, running out of time before rescuing the girl,  or getting the speed power-up when you are near the top of the building.</resource>

Defenceless against the Demon's magic, you succumb to his powers, leaving the your Master to fight the Demon King alone. Your master falls in combat, dying. But, with his last breath, he summons the Wizard Mage. The Demon King fearing defeat, escapes to the future. Tormented, the young samurai seeks the teachings of the Wizard Mage in the ways of magic. Boiled with revenge and armed with a magical sword, the young samurai follows the Demon King into the future and the unknown...&amp;quot;

The First Samurai is a platform action game very much similar to other platform games, but with a medieval oriental touch to it in addition to various unique features.

Arriving in the new unknown land, you are defenceless hence your fists and kicks. But as you journey forth, you'll find your trusty magical sword as well as throwing weapons such as knives and axes. With your martial art skills, your enemy best beware with those sudden moves that may prove fatal!

The First Samurai offers a wide array of weapons, special items and other objects. Combat is usually melee, either relying on your punch or kicks or using the magical sword to slash some pretty skillful blows in whatever direction possible.

Monsters are forever regenerating but food for health is plentiful. It actually takes an effort to be killed...</resource>

You control a fight jet, which is armed to the teeth, in 8 missions, which take place at different operation areas scattered all over the world: training missions in the Gulf of Mexico, Mediterranean mission, Gulf mission, Arctic mission, Black Sea mission, Far East mission, East Russia mission, Central Europe mission. You can choose your weapons before a mission and at a stopover during the mission. Corresponding to the operation area the design of the landscape changes and you can even see cloud cover and fly over or under it..

You start the game with the rank &amp;quot;Rookie&amp;quot;. For a promotion a mission must be solved completely, i.e. destroying the mission target and landing safely. (Landing and starting are done automatically, so you just have to reach the destination). To reach the highest rank all missions must be accomplished successfully. The order of the ranks: Rookie, Sergeant, 2nd Lieutenant, 1st Lieutenant, Captain, Major, L. Colonel, Colonel</resource>

The game has more features than first generation flight simulators. Pilots are expected to pay attention to small details. SubLOGIC encouraged the players to go to flight stores and purchase flight-training manuals and aeronautical charts to help them understand the variables within the program. The game is oriented toward pilots-in-training, but there are options for laymen too: an easy mode, and a slightly more detailed reality mode. These modes do not require the same level of knowledge.</resource>

    <resource id="d4634bd14ad1e03ad897cf7f2cb15152f9cdcc6c" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">The Flintstones is a game based on the popular cartoon series The Flintstones by Hanna-Barbera Productions Inc.

It's weekend! Fred Flintstone thinks of only one thing: bowling  
with his friend and neighbor Barney.
Unfortunately, his wife Wilma got other plans for him. Fred has to paint the living room and Wilma is not going to help him with it. No, she goes shopping.
And if that's not enough, Wilma also tells Fred that his mother-in-law is coming over.

The Flintstones game is divided in four parts.

Part 1: Painting the walls of your living room.
To go to the bowling alley before it is closed Fred has to paint  the walls as quickly as possible. To paint the walls Fred uses the tail of a living squirrel. 
Pebbles tries to leap out her playpen and starts crawling around and starts scribbling on the walls. If Fred wants to put Pebbles back in the playpen then he has to drop the squirrel, that immediately starts wandering off. When Pebbles is back in the playpen Fred has to chase the squirrel and dip its tail in the paint again.

Part 2: Driving your car on the way to the bowling center.
Finally, when all walls are painted Fred can go to the bowling  
alley!
Fred has to drive to the bowling alley but unfortunately the roads are in a very bad condition. The road surface is dire and covered with rocks!
And if one of the wheels hit a bump it will break off the car and disappear into the distance.

Part 3: A bowling competition between Fred and Barney.
At the bowling alley the following bowling parameters can be set: the spin and speed of the ball and the starting position of the player.
Each turn gives two throws (except he gets a strike). A game  
takes ten turns. while a match takes three games.

Part 4: Saving Pebbles at a construction site.
On his way home Fred discovers that Pebbles has disappeared!  Don't let Wilma find that out!
Fred finds Pebbles at a construction site on top of some  
scaffolding. He has to climb the scaffolding to rescue her.
If Fred fails to rescue his daughter then Barney rescues her and Fred will be branded as a failure!</resource>

You start in the 4th division with the team of your choice, and can play on indefinitely in the hope of reaching the top division and dominating it, as well as winning the cups. Players can be bought or sold, with their transfer values varying according to the size of any bid. Their skills and morale vary as the season goes on, with resting key players in easy matches often a key move. You can take out a loan, limited depending on your division, while day-to-day bills must be covered. Matches feature short animated highlights sequences of key moments.</resource>

You start with a small amount of money, which is used to buy goal cards; each of these sets you up a chance in a match. Up to three can be played in each game, making Hat-Tricks a possibility.

The action sequence is viewed from a 1st person perspective with the ball at the bottom of the screen and you either get a shot at goal or a penalty kick. If you have the chance to shoot at goal, you have the ball at your feet and you can move left or right before shooting. Defenders will come at you so you must move and shoot as quick as possible hoping the shot isn't blocked or saved by the keeper. The penalty attempt sees you trying to place the ball past the keeper. Fail to score enough goals and you may lose your place in the team; do especially well and you may gain a transfer up the league.

There is no arcade sequence for the C16 or the BBC Micro version, you just get text asking if you want to shoot to the left or right with text describing the outcome.</resource>

This game offers a unique twist, leaving you 'managing' the career of a single player, involving matches and transfers.

You start with 10 'goal cards' - up to 3 can be played in each match, each of them giving you a shooting chance, at which point arcade action skill comes in. The better you perform, the higher your wages are, the more chance you have of a big-money transfer and international call-up, and the less chance you have of being dropped from the team.

There's also a trivia section, which asks increasingly difficult questions allowing you to go double or nothing on knowing the answers - up to £8000 a time can be won on this.</resource>

Their task is to infiltrate the energy production plant on the planet KARIS by rescuing any survivors and destroying any aliens that are holding them captive.

The player is equipped with a flame thrower which they can use to destroy the aliens, but caution must be taken so that they do not destroy survivors by accident. If the player spends too much time in a room, a green alien appears in their exact location. It is invincible to shots, so the player needs to get away as soon as possible. If the player comes into contact with any aliens, their energy is depleted. When the player has no energy left, the crew member they are controlling dies, requiring them to select another member.

Also in each room are supplies, and the player can stock up on more ammo, grenades, or health if required. Teleports around the facility warp the player to a room with a blueprint reader. Using this lets players either travel between the plant's six floors or to another area within the same floor.

His family has run out of food and his wife has told him it's up to him to restock the larder. Being a lazy so-and-so, Foxx isn't terribly keen on the idea, but a few taps from Mrs. Foxx's rolling pin hav managed to convince him.

So, after picking up his trusty, er, well, *rusty* pistol off its shelf, Foxx heads off along the scrolling landscape towards Farmer Killimanjaro's place, fingering the bumps on his head and wondering why he married that old battleaxe in the first place.</resource>

As Frank, you must take on 8 progressively tough boxers to win the title.  

The action is viewed from right behind Frank in 3D, meaning that you can see and feel the full impact of punches. A full range of moves is provided, with the standard jabs complimented by body punches and the ability to dodge, duck or raise your guard.

Each punch weakens your opponent's strength, although going long enough without being hit can see this begin to recover. A rain of blows can produce a quick knockout, but in general you must hit him many times, and then with a knockout blow, to see him go down.</resource>

After discovering a gruesome murder, your interest in something greater than the routine of 80s Liverpool is awoken.

You explore the streets and houses in the search of a way out. The main basis of the game involves picking up objects and using them in the correct way - most objects have more than one potential use, and misusing them is the only way the game can be lost. There are several sub-games along the way, including shoot 'em ups, a maze and a jigsaw puzzle.</resource>

Each level takes place on a single screen, each with five full-width platforms connected by telegraph poles. Freddie runs along the platforms; he cannot pass through the telegraph poles but may climb up and down either side of them. The goal of the game is to collect the pots of gold resting on the platforms, as well as optional bonus items which scroll through the playing area. Each level is patrolled by three to five monstrous &amp;quot;Greeblies&amp;quot; that Freddie must avoid, lest he lose a life.The game has a total of sixteen playable levels. The 17th level has a game breaking bug, as this level mistakenly has all poles removed. This means that Freddie can't reach the platforms above him, making this level impossible to clear. The player is forced to reset/turn off the system.</resource>

Evidently this diversion could not have finished very well, he crashed with a meteorite, lost the control of his spaceship and fell with it to planet Ternat's moon, where it's located the enemy base of Kaldar. Injured and laughing, he managed to left the smoky spaceship and slowly noticed that in such a place he wouldn't be received in a very friendly way.

Both these sections are fraught with a variety of hazards, each of which will kill the frog and cost you a life if contact is made.

The road is full of cars and trucks, at variable speeds. The river water itself is fatal, as are the snakes which hover within on later levels. Frogger must use the arrangement of logs, turtles (which are only there for a short time) and alligators (but stay away form their faces), and then jump into one of the open home-cells, ideally one containing a fly for extra points.

The player takes control of a frog and must move the frog from the bottom of the screen to the top avoiding obstacles along the way. A busy street and a river must be crossed by evading cars and jumping onto logs and turtles. Bonus points are scored by hopping onto lady frogs and flies. The player has 3 lives but a bonus life is given when a score of 10,000 points is achieved.

The object of the game is to set a high score. It can be played with a joystick or with the keyboard.</resource>

Starting out underwater, reach the top of the pond while avoiding dangerous alligators and fish (you can ride a turtle for safety!). Once on top of the pond, hop across logs, birds, and even a whale to the life preserver trailing behind a tugboat. In the third location you have to hop across a flock of birds to reach a cloud at the top of the screen. Each frog has a time limit to safely reach one of the homes on each of the three screens. You move on to the next level when a frog has safely reached each of the homes on all screens.</resource>

With no planes or tanks able to move around the island, a new development, the Death Tank Interceptor has been chosen along with yourself to drive around the island collecting as many supply dumps as you can. Front Line is a top view multi-directional scrolling game where you drive the tank to collect the dumps while shelling or avoiding the various vehicles and obstacles like trees, buildings and rivers. The vehicles you will encounter are tanks, planes and helicopters and your other obstacles are gun placements and mines. To fire a shell from your tank, you hold the fire button down and release it to make it explode and you are equipped with 20. If you are hit by any weapons or you run over a mine then you lose part of your armour shown by a gauge. Collecting a supply dump though increases your armour and you have 20 shells once again.

At the beginning of the game the player selects a one player or two player game. The objective as one of the members of the G.I. Joe team is to eliminate any threats from Cobra and to capture eight Cobra operatives. The game cannot be completed if too many members of either side are placed in jail, other members are released to perpetuate the game.

Two modes of play are used: overhead vehicular combat sections, where the player controls a member of the G.I. Joe Special Forces, and one-on-one fights with Cobra operatives. In the overhead combat portion of the game, the player could select one of eight Joe team members (such as Snake Eyes), to face off in combat against one of eight Cobra agents (such as Zartan). There are different geographical locations, such as woods, desert and arctic tundra. Each character had access to a vehicle from the G.I. Joe series, such as the Dragonfly helicopter, Rattler plane, M.O.B.A.T. or H.I.S.S. tank.

The one-on-one melee battle portion of the game featured sixteen characters available for the Joe team: Duke, Scarlett, Recondo, Torpedo, Snake Eyes, Roadblock, Spirit, Zap, Gung-Ho, Snow Job, Blowtorch, Stalker, Ace, Wild Bill, Steeler, and Clutch. The Joes were pitted against eight Cobras: Destro, the Baroness, Zartan, Firefly, Cobra Commander, Storm Shadow, Major Bludd, and Scrap-Iron.</resource>

What you see is what the player sees – control and viewpoint passes from the kicker to the receiver on a punt or kickoff, and the quarterback to the running back or receiver on a pass or kick. Releasing passes involves rotating the controls to select the pass direction. To take the ball, aim the visible hands in the centre of the screen.

There are 28 teams split into four divisions; their names are fictional (including the Seagulls, Mustangs and Geronimos), and each is rated out of 3 on 8 areas of skill. Matches last for 4 quarters of either 4 or 7 minutes' in-play time. Menus to select plays or teams involve using diagonal movements for selection. 

Standard Gridiron rules apply – gain 10 yards in 4 attempts (downs) without fumbling or having a pass intercepted; kick a punt or field goal if you are about to fail at this.</resource>

The player moves left and right to aim at an alien, then shoots a bullet up the screen, and the alien it hits is killed. The aliens are classed as Drones, Emissaries, Hornets and Commanders, with those higher up the screen scoring more points when destroyed. At set intervals an enemy will move down the screen towards you, escorting a bomber, which is a moment of high danger. Clear a wave and another is generated.</resource>

Players move a space ship left and right to fire at a group of alien ships near the top of the screen. They fire bullets and come swooping down like a kamikaze. Based on the colour they have different behaviour and some of them require multiple hits. To finish the stage all aliens have to be defeated. The wave is repeated in every stage, but enemies gradually become faster. Just like in the regular Galaga, the largest enemies can move down and fire a fixed beam that makes the area smaller to move. After a number of stages a Challenge Stage can be accessed with a new pattern. The player receives a bonus there based on the number of kills. You start with three lives. A bonus ship is awarded at 20,000 points and then at every 70,000 points.</resource>

All the power of Gremla rested in the almost religious fidelity of her lieutenant Arkos; nevertheless, the intelligence of this Mega-Terminator of battle had evolved on the last ultraguarks in such a way that, finally, he left Gremla and he was united to the troops of the sidereal infantry, who commanded the general of the blue star Mc Killer.

As far as the game in itself, it's frenetic arcade divided in two parts, in which when it stops to arrive at second, you needed a key access that you obtained at the end of first.</resource>

The primary gameplay involves object manipulation, gaining objects either by picking up or receiving them from other characters (usually in exchange for other objects).

Most characters from the cartoons play a part in the game. Odie the dog follows you around - swipe him for points. Garfield's cousin Nermal can help you out. They can also carry objects for Garfield's use.

Garfield needs regular food and rest - without one of these he falls asleep and it is Game Over. Contact with many foes is draining. A butcher's is one major food source.</resource>

    <resource id="166406306e6ce1100c899ff43377ee40732fde29" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Much of the design and programming of Superstar Ice Hockey (by many of the same programmers) is revised to provide a six-a-side soccer game. You can control any combination of centre-forward, goalkeeper (on the C64) and manager. For much of the game you are merely the centre-forward as the action unfolds around you - don't be afraid to track back and help out. 

The ball sticks closely to a player, who can pass, shoot, head or bicycle-kick it. Goalkeepers are penalised for retaining possession for too long (a rule later adapted for use in real-life football). Match length can be between 6 and 90 minutes, by toggling the speed at which time moves. Fouls are fully implemented.

Single matches can be played in the cassette version, but the disk version adds a full-season structure. 64 English teams are split into 4 divisions of 16, with a season consisting of either 7 or 15 matches.</resource>

One or two players must make their way through 100 levels of mayhem and magic. 

It featured a choice of four characters to play with, each with different weapons. Thor the Warrior, has a  bludgeoning battle axe, Thyra the Valkyrie, has a close range sword, Questor the Elf has his long range bow, and Merlin the Wizard has magical bolts.

Ghosts, goblins and even the life draining Death are your enemies. Enemies stream out of generators, so destroy these before tackling the rest. 

Keys are needed to open the many doors within the levels, and in some situations a door will contain only bonus items, not a progressive route.  Scattered magic potions act like smart bombs and clear the screen of all enemies. Beware of poison though, this reduces your energy level.
Treasure is abundant throughout the levels and adds to your score.</resource>

Like in the predecessors you empty areas infested by all kinds of enemies while running for the exit. Like this was rather a straight forward thing in the first two games, it's not that easy to finish a level anymore. While you only had to run until you find the exit (and besides killing hordes of enemies you probably find some keys to unlock doors leading to deeper dungeons) you might have to solve a few &amp;quot;quests&amp;quot; to proceed to the next level in this installment. These &amp;quot;quests&amp;quot; are very basic, for example you have to find object A, then bring it to B, advance to C and finally go to D to uncover the exit. While the first two games had a top-down view, Gauntlet 3 has an isometric perspective. The old four characters (warrior, wizard, elf and valkyrie) are ready for action again and this time they get backup by four new characters which include the Lizard, Neptune, Stoneman and the Iceman.</resource>

The game is viewed top down, and can be set to either move left-right or top-bottom.

League and cup tournaments are included, as are single matches and set-piece practice sections (you have full control of these). The gameplay involves a number of advanced moves, and includes a gauge to control the exact dimensions of a kick (height and curl as well as strength), if you can use it quickly enough. Unusually, you have control over the goalkeeper, so can only blame yourself when you concede a goal. The players each have their own skills and strengths, and these develop as the game goes on – if you play well, your players become better, and more capable of facing better opposition.</resource>

It targets the feel of pioneering races between 250mph planes in the valleys of the southern USA between brave but honest goggle-wearing men - a sort of Mille Miglia in the sky.

The game consists of 16 courses, which are marked out by giant suspended cones, each of which is to be completed against a time limit, while avoiding contact with the other planes. You must stay within the cones, any time spent outside it results in the alloted time ticking down at a prohibitively fast rate (so don't think of short-cutting the track). After every second successful race, you take on a bonus track, in which balloons must be hit for points.</resource>

The basic idea is that you are presented with 2 sets of tiles, and must make the left one identical to the 'control' set on the right. The colours are defined in a sequence - red, green, blue, purple, yellow - and when you click on a tile, that tile's colour moves forward by two in that sequence (for example a blue one becomes yellow), whereas the tiles next to it move by one colour (for example, blue becomes purple).

Any that move past the end fo the sequence disappear, causing surrounding blocks to drop. You get a limited number of moves, and limited time as well. Fortuantely there are passwords, delivered by cutely-drawn naked Japanese girls (although the private parts are covered up).</resource>

There are six events on offer, which represent standard strongman tasks such as truck-pulling, a tug of war and wrestling. Each must be completed within a time limit; points are awarded based on how much time is left.

The game's control method and design philosophy distinguishes between each of the 8 main muscles Geoff uses. After a joystick-waggling challenge to raise as much strength as possible, you can choose which muscles to assign it to, which adds an element of strategy and memory-testing.

During each event, the 8 muscles are displayed on either side of the screen, and as one comes into use it will flash. Controlling a cursor, you must click on this as quickly as possible to achieve maximum effect. Any energy unused on each muscle is kept over for future events.</resource>

    <resource id="52046d9fa320ea4e31b6f1afb385f92fdbfcd9a2" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Based on the movie of the same name, the Ghostbusters are the ones to call who will &amp;quot;bust&amp;quot; any ghost hauntings. It does this through the use of nuclear accelerated &amp;quot;proton packs&amp;quot; and traps, whereby the ghosts can be captured and transferred to a secure storage facility. However New York City has suddenly become a very haunted place, and the number of ghosts has suddenly increased. The Ghostbusters must reduce the paranormal (PK) level in the city, representing ghost power, before the Temple of Zuul awakens and ressurects an evil goddess, Gozer.

Ghostbusters is an action game that combines an overhead view and a side-view. From Ghostbusters HQ, the player must monitor the map of New York City for &amp;quot;ghost alarms&amp;quot; as well as casual spirits, and plot a route to the alarmed area. The player then controls the Ghostbuster vehicle as it drives through traffic. Here, the player is able to capture casual ghosts on the way if they are en route. Once at the location, the game switches to a side-view. Two of the ghostbusters will take position and activate their proton beams and toss a trap to the ground. The player will attempt to  maneuver the ghost(s) over the placed trap. Once activated, the trap attempts to capture any ghosts directly above it. Successful capture will earn the player money, which can then be used to purchase new Ghostbusters vehicles and new modifications for the vehicle. Unsuccessful capture will see the ghost fly away.

As the game progresses, the PK energy of the city increases. Ghostbusters must keep it under critical levels by being constantly  successful at ghost captures. Eventually the Temple of Zuul will activate, and if the PK levels are still manageable, the Ghostbusters can venture there for a final showdown with Gozer.</resource>

As a member of the elite Silent But Deadly force, you have been sent in to destroy their plastic island, most importantly their 10 reactors. The twist is that you are expected to do this on board a rickety hang-glider.
Everything on the island must be bombed using your grenades, but the most efficient method of travel is to hug the ground and stay low, so a balance must be found to be in the sky at the right times. Each reactor is protected by lasers, although by running into the nearest control tower these can be sent haywire for long enough to allow you to jump in and destroy them.</resource>

Your go-kart is equipped with a limited number of smoke-bombs which delays the other drivers for a limited time, and more bombs can be found around the maze. Also on screen is a radar showing all the bonuses, bombs and other drivers and each level has to be completed within a time limit.</resource>

    <resource id="f1949fc3046b974cb671a078f5f2ba8ecaa9345c" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">The Goonies is based on the Steven Spielberg film of the same name, in which a motley crew of suburban kids in Astoria, Oregon, must save their homes from being foreclosed upon and find their salvation in a treasure map leading to an old pirate ship in a cavern. However, they must maneuver around an eccentric family of Italian criminals -- the Fratellis -- on the lam, who are also on the trail of the treasure.

The game is divided into a series of eight screens based on scenes from the film, each of which contains puzzles that must be solved by coordinating the activities of two of the kids from the Goonies (and in the last screen, the elephant-man-like Sloth) without getting killed by deadly bats, homicidal Fratellis, flying demon-skull thingies, or other environmental hazards.</resource>

    <resource id="1e42c085e6b172c3184d3cf541ed8a604d08a3b1" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Gorf is a game that consists of five levels:
The first level called Astro Battles has the player's ship behind a defensive shield, defending against an alien attack. The level is a top-down view, with the player's ship and shield on one side and the aliens on the other side; this level bears the most resemblance to Space Invaders.

The second level called Laser Attack is made up of a formation of ships, with some that swoop down and a laser that fires at the player's ship. Bonus ships also tend to appear in this level.

The third level is called Galaxians, and as the name suggests it is very similar to the game Galaxian with ships constantly dive bombing the player's spaceship. This mission only appears in the Arcade version.

The fourth level called Space Warp, has the player entering hyperspace.. The viewpoint switches from a top-down view to a behind-the-ship view. One by one, alien vessels will come out and fly in a circular formation shooting at the player's ship with the players goal being to destroy each one.

The fifth and final level is called Flag Ship. In this level, the player does not fight a wave of enemies, but a single one which happens to be a large Flag Ship with a weak spot which is its core. Hitting the weak spot will instantly destroy it, but the player must first shoot through a similar shield that the player had in the first level.

Finishing the game increases the player's rank and starts the game over at level 1 with a faster game speed for more challenge.</resource>

When you get hit by a projectile or object, you lose one of your spray cans, and if you run out of these, you will also lose a life.

When you get to the end of each location, you will reach a wall where you can spray-paint on. If you spray over the specific regions, you will get rewarded for your effort. You are on a time limit on these sections, and when time runs out, you move to the next location.</resource>

Pitstop timing and planning is crucial as well, although only tires are changed in late-1980s F1. Graphics are sprite-based.</resource>

In reality it was an overhead-view Super Sprint style arcade racer for 1 or 2 players, similar in many ways to the company's BMX Simulator. 

There were up to 14 circuits depending on the format, which incorporated many underpasses (some of them deliberately unrealistic) and tight curves. There were oil slicks to avoid and points bonuses to pick up.

The cars have slow acceleration but a lot of power down the straights. You are scored based on your overall time and your fastest lap. Lose to the computer car and it's game over.</resource>

As before, the action is viewed from overhead across a succession of tracks featuring hairpins, oil slicks and similar hazards. You must complete each race within the time limit; and time left after one race is added to your allowance on the next one. After the race you can view a replay.

The two main new features are a 3-player mode (there are always 3 cars present in total) and a damage meter which mean that repeat contract with barriers or other cars hampers your performance.</resource>

Gather round, kids, and listen to grandpa tell of his time as a prisoner of war in Germany. ‘Twas back in 1942. Those were rough times, lads. Rough times. Been shot down in my plane. Darn shame it was, it being a good plane and all. Next I know, there’s this group of German soldiers standing round me, and off we go to a P.O.W. camp. Big thing, that, plenty of guards all around with a keen eye on your every move, and full of unfortunate souls like myself. Just that they do naught but sit all day and sob and generally be no great help when it comes to doing the Great Escape. But not me, no sir! I showed them Germans, I did, and I was out of their fashionable high security “he who comes here, stays here” camp in no time. You wanna hear that story? Bet you do!

Controlling a prisoner of war in a German camp, your goal is to break out undetected. There are numerous ways to freedom – back doors, cracked fences, even underground tunnels. However, you have to plan your escape while obeying the strict rules of the camp. 

Number one: Daily program. You have to attend two roll calls a day, one meal, one exercise, and stay in bed at night. Failure to appear at any of these events will result in the alarm being rung. When you do not touch the controls, your protagonist will move automatically, going to all important events. You have to detect and use gaps in the time-table to explore the camp. 

Rule number two: guard rooms are off limits. If a soldier catches you in a room that is forbidden, you will be placed in solitary confinement. Of course, you have to enter restricted parts of the camp to find items crucial for your escape. The moral flag will turn from green to red to indicate that you are in an area where you shouldn’t be. 

Rule no three: no prisoner may carry forbidden objects. When you are caught in a suspicious situation, you will be stripped of all items that you found so far. To avoid that, you have to deposit objects in a safe place. You need to find keys to open locked doors, uniforms for camouflage, flashlights to see in dark tunnels, and many more. 

Rule number four: guard commands are to be obeyed at all times. The German soldiers patrol on fixed routes and have a line of sight. You have to learn the guard’s routes and sneak past their backs to avoid detection when breaking out. If you are caught, your morale will decrease. If your morale reaches zero, your will to escape is broken.</resource>

Elite's implementation of this is a five-level side-view action game, in which you run around avoiding or shooting the gremlins. Each level has a secret object which must be collected. Bonus items such as extra lives and time can be collected, as can improved weapons, and credits to spend on a new weapon after each level.</resource>

There are 16 teams to choose from; the Dolphins, Packers and 49ers are all in there. Players are rated out of 10 on skill, energy and form. Player trading is handled in a soccer-style transfer market, rather than with a US 'draft' format - mid-season trades for money are common. Matches have no direct tactical input, and are viewed from remote highlight shots, which do not have the distinct pitch markings of the original (an old Softstone game released under three different names).</resource>

In this Centipede style game you play a retired captain of a starship, one of those who had won the previous war against aliens.  You come out of retirement because the aliens are back, tougher than ever.  Thus a second gridwar begins.

You pilot your ship and shoot at chains of pods coming at you.  As you hit the pods, they break into smaller independent chains.  The aliens seem to have a sense of humor, though.  Each pod in the chain coming at you looks like a...camel.  Flying camels from outer space.</resource>

Each section features a number of challenges, in which one of three choices on what to do must be made.

The game scrolls vertically, as you move up the screen shooting enemies, finding good strategic firing points and collecting powerups. As the enemy soldiers come towards you in groups, some care is required when picking them off, either using your gun or the grenades. There are also hostages carried by some soldiers, with points bonuses for not shooting these but shooting their captors. Each level ends with a boss.</resource>

The player starts each day at 0830 with a set quota of gumballs they must successfully sort through the day. Gumballs of different color are expelled from the machine in the top left corner, and they work their way through a series of complex devices to eventually be deposited from various slots at the bottom of the machine. The player controls the motion of various levers within the machine to control the pathway of the different colored gumballs. The player must then also move the colored carts at the bottom of the screen so that the correct colored gumball is deposited in each cart.</resource>

    <resource id="f140521ee303fa1105af72307dbdd4b72061ec06" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Gun.Smoke is a top-down scrolling shooter that casts the gamer as a lone gunman, out to save the gold rush town of Hicksville from a fearsome group of bandits known as the Wingates. Each level has a particular target enemy, although his or her henchmen must also be taken out.

Although it largely takes place on foot, the gameplay resembles Commando, with its top-down action. The screen scrolls at a constant rate, and enemies come at you from the edges, to be shot or avoided. You can grab various power-ups along the way. Finding a horse will allow you to get hit twice before you die rather than just once. There are scenes in which you raft up a river and use the tracks of a railway line.

On the NES you can tap the A button to fire up and right, the B button to fire up and left, or A and B simultaneously to fire straight ahead. One-button control systems mimic all this.</resource>

Gunship starts with flight training at a base in the USA.  Tutorials teach you to handle the copter; once the controls and flying skills are mastered, there are escalating challenges and hundreds of missions in any one of four regions of the world, including Southeast Asia, Central America, the Middle East, and the USSR and it's Warsaw Pact allies in Western Europe.</resource>

    <resource id="7bc7e94643fa9cb55f69102e6d1b8bfd735d595a" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Releasing a game which resembles a well-known arcade game before any official license can be released was always a challenge for publishers, and in this case Melbourne House released a game similar to Marble Madness. Controlling a gyroscope, you most navigate your way down a sloping track full of hazards. The viewpoint is in fixed isometric 3D, with hazards including buildings, ramps and drops. The gyroscope accelerates quickly and takes time to slow down, so it is easy to go into a screen too fast.

Failing to keep the gyroscope spinning freely as it navigates these costs you one of your seven lives. You are also playing within a time limit - losing a life sees you return to the start of a level without regaining lost time, but running out of time sees you lose a life, but be able to continue from where you were left with a new set of time (so, as with Chase HQ, completing tricky levels can take 2 or 3 lives at first). 

You get time bonuses for completing a screen, points bonuses for completing one of the seven four-screen levels, and an extra life for reaching 1000 points.
At the end of level 7, you will get 1000 points for each remaining lives, doubling your current amount of lives. You will then start again at level 1 but mirrored by the vertical axis (you are now climbing from the bottom of screen to the top).
After level 14 (level 7 mirror), you will again win 1000 points for each remaining lives and then the game loop on level 1 (not mirrored).</resource>

Volcanic activity has trapped numerous miners, and it is your job to save them. As Roderick Hero, you need to make your way through the dangerous mineshaft avoiding the dangerous creatures and lava, and find out where the miners are located before you run out of energy. To help on your mission, Roderick Hero has several useful types of equipment. A prop pack will allow you to hover and fly around the mineshaft and (hopefully) avoid the many dangers within. Your helmet features a short range microlaser beam which can be used to destroy the bats, spiders, snakes, and other creatures you'll encounter in the mines. From time to time, your path through the mine may be blocked by stone or lava walls. You begin each mission with six sticks of dynamite which can be used to destroy these obstacles (be careful you don't blow yourself up, though!) If you run out of dynamite, your laser beam can also be used to destroy the walls, though this will take longer and use up more energy. As the levels progress, the mine shaft will become longer and more maze-like, creatures will more frequently block the path, and lava walls and pools will appear which are dangerous to the touch.</resource>

Once in, you'll soon find out that you've accidentally stumbled upon a conspiracy of global impact.

This works perfectly for Centro-Holographis until two of their droids, Hammerfist (male) and Metalisis (female) malfunction. They try to put things right, and come under your control in this side-view action game with adventure elements.

You can switch between the two characters at any moment, and must use this wisely as their abilities differ greatly. On each screen you must kill all enemies, as well as taking out the robots which keep the doors locked.</resource>

Diese muss man in seinem eigenen Kontor, bei schwankenden Preisen möglichst teuer, verkaufen. Als weitere Anregung steht noch der Aufstieg zum Bürgermeister im Raum, welcher sich nur erreichen lässt, wenn man auch das nötige Kleingeld dafür aufbringen kann.</resource>

Extras and 'diamonds' can be collected from shooting or otherwise destroying rocks and walls. There are two playing modes available, one player or two players.

Extra lives will be earned depending on the number of diamonds collected. Warp Zones and hidden entrances allow access to secret zones in the levels. Each world ends with a boss monster.</resource>

    <resource id="193351e89e5cd18ed278b9c3ffc7cc9eec1289c6" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Hard Drivin' is a 3D arcade hit from Atari Games. You are in control of a high-performance sports car. Your objective is to race around the course as fast as possible and hit as many checkpoints as possible. If you hit a checkpoint you gain extra time to go farther. You will see traffic on the road both in your direction and coming down the opposite direction, so be careful when you pass... 

The course has two sections: speed track, and stunt track. Speed track is longer, but you can usually achieve higher speeds. Stunt track requires you to perform several stunts such as jumping bridges, driving through a loop, and so on. 

Crashing the car has no serious consequences and indeed shows a replay of your crash from a cinematic angle. Admire your crash head-on into the cement truck, or clipping the minivan, or flying off the bridge in the wrong angle... You lose several seconds as your car is &amp;quot;reset&amp;quot; and you get up to speed again. 

The home conversions retain most of the then-advanced 3D graphics but lack the force-feedback that was in the arcade version.</resource>

If the souls fall into the vortex before the player captures them, then the player must go in after the souls. The vortex leads to the maze, and the object here is to try and capture the souls before they enter another vortex, while avoiding snakes and crashing into walls.

Four pieces are needed to complete the level, but there were also other pickups such as ammo and energy. There were 12 levels to complete plus a hidden bonus level.</resource>

BOOK PASSAGE TO ANY PORT: You have the thinnest of leads, the diary of a madman who disappeared hunting for the hidden tomb of a legendary pharaoh. You also have no time to waste. There are over 30 cities and settlements to visit, and you're not the only one on the trail.

SEARCH FOR CLUES AND EQUIPMENT: What the natives know will help, if you can get them to talk. The tools and goods inside their huts will help, too - shovels, canteens, canoe paddles, whips, ropes, machetes, guns, maps, gifts, and more. Just be careful. Not everyone will be happy to see you.

GEOGRAPHICALLY AND HISTORICALLY ACCURATE: Imagine a huge map of Africa stuffed into your computer. The Nile. The Congo. The Niger. Mt. Kilimanjaro. The Sahara. Lake Victoria. The whole thing. And if you get lost, just press the button. &amp;quot;The Nile River,&amp;quot; the screen will say. What it won't say is, &amp;quot;about 2 miles above the falls.&amp;quot;

AUTOMATIC MAPS AND RECORDS: As you explore, your computer draws maps and keeps a journal, recording the most important clues for later review. It also keeps a record of your last two, uh... misfortunes. &amp;quot;Lost incredibly valuable talisman while running from very angry rhino,&amp;quot; it might say, or &amp;quot;Oops, better luck next time.&amp;quot;</resource>

There are six levels, all with distinctly cutesy themes and colourful graphics. The level layouts are extremely complicated, and you have to make your way back to base after each one, before being transported onto the next one, all within a time limit. The levels are full of wizards who must be shot, as well as a small amount of character interaction.</resource>

You take control of a wizard, a dwarf, a barbarian and an elf, each with different strengths and weaknesses, who each start the 14 missions from opposite sides of the board.

Strict turn-based movement rules apply, as actions other than movement can only be carried out before or after the move, the size of which is limited by a dice roll. These moves are carried out using an icon-based system. Characters can fight the many monsters which lurk, or cast spells to vanquish them. There are magic potions to uncover, but also hidden traps, so mapping is advised. Treasure can be collected, and traded at the shop after each level.</resource>

He has stolen the Golden Talisman that had protected the city in the past. Broken into five pieces, the Talisman is hidden in a labyrinth filled with monsters. Now the hero has to find all five pieces of the Talisman and destroy the evil wizard in order to restore peace to the city.

The labyrinth is explored from a side scrolling perspective. It is composed of 64 room spread over five levels. Each room is 8 screens large, providing a total of 512 screens to explore. The goal of each level is to find a piece of the Talisman while fighting off lots of different monsters ranging from birds to jumping eyeballs to fire-breathing dragons. 

The hero can jump, climb ropes, swim and shoot as well as pick up different power-ups and objects. He can carry five objects, but only hold/use one at a time. Pressing the space bar changes the object in use. Usable objects include keys, ropes, lamps to light dark rooms, flags that improve the hero's firepower and others. 

Power-ups can be collected to replenish health or air. If the hero runs out of air, being underwater will slowly decrease his health. To help the hero finding his way through the labyrinth, a map is shown at the lower left side of the screen. It marks all visited rooms, shows his current position and indicates whether there are any items in a room.</resource>

A rebel sector of the Alliance sends a &amp;quot;Herobot&amp;quot; into their base to retrieve the weapon along with important data. Players take control of the Herobot and must find all six parts of the Z-Ray and download the data from the main computer. There are 12 different enemy droids that attack in different ways, some follow a set path, some charge the Herobot and a few can shoot. The Herobot can shoot at his enemies or use an energy bomb that destroys everything onscreen, but also depletes half of its energy. The base is laid out like a maze with energy barriers and conveyor belts blocking the robot's progress. Energy barriers can be turned off via switches, while conveyor belts can only be stopped temporarily by accessing terminals. Terminals can also be used to display a small map of the surroundings.</resource>

Only four men, who would become known as the four heroes of Karn, survived the massacre and managed to flee. However, they were soon caught and put under a spell. The player takes on the role of the legendary Stranger from &amp;quot;a land where men can fly and machines can think&amp;quot;, and must rescue the four heroes and retrieve the treasures of the realm.

Heroes of Karn is an Interactive Fiction game with graphics and more unusually, music. You can type in commands to manipulate objects, solve puzzles or attack enemies. While it is not possible to have conversations with NPCs, you can give them orders to do certain tasks.</resource>

Your job in this strategy game is to oversee its development.

The game is played via an icon control system, with a common set of icons and information panels are displayed around these screens. There are six distinct screens used to make the decisions, plus the ability to track existing satellites and keep track of active Soviet attacks.

The Research &amp; Development screen is the first port of call. It is split into six components, to which you must assign money and staff. The President will give the order to arm or disarm your units (including the activation code). Once you have working SDIs and the permission codes, you can launch them using the Shield screen.

Espionage and Reconnaissance cameras are located to keep track of enemy development, although these figures are not always precise. The Threats screen lets you keep track of enemy resources and moods. The World screen effectively moves the game forward in time.</resource>

    <resource id="e870f0f6bf248d25f31ee3060b4ecccea12b03d9" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">The 1986 cult film Highlander is the basis of this adaptation, which reduces the film to its swordfighting scenes. Taking the role of the immortal Highlander Connor MacLeod, the player has to win three consecutive battles against increasingly skilled opponents: MacLeod's teacher Ramirez, a character named Fizir, and finally the mighty Kurgan, the main antagonist of the movie.

A battle is won by depleting the enemy of his energy. Energy is lost by being hit, or by attempting an attack that is blocked by the enemy. To win, a combination of attacking and parrying moves is necessary, of which several are available depending on the character's stance (standing or crouched) and the direction the joystick is pushed.

Two players can engage in a duel in two-player mode.</resource>

Your house has just been destroyed, followed shortly thereafter by your planet Earth (mostly harmless).  You’ve been rescued by your friend Ford Prefect, who’s not actually an out-of-work actor.  He has given you a book (The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy), a towel, and is now telling you to put a fish in your ear.  It must be a Thursday; you’ve never quite gotten the hang of Thursdays.

The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy is written by Douglas Adams and Steven Meretzky and based on Adams’ BBC radio series, television series, and the series of subsequent novelizations.  It’s one of the classic Interactive Fiction games produced by Infocom, labeled as Science Fiction and has a Standard Level of Difficulty.  Though divergent from the source material, the main characters, locations, and concepts are here.  Unlike the book, death can come quickly if Arthur fails to observe his surroundings, collect inventory, talk to people, and consult the Guide.  DON’T PANIC!

Original C=64 Grey Box Contents:
Megadodo Publications Advertising Booklet for your very own Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy complete with Fluff, Destruct orders for your home and planet, a nice red button with the words DON'T PANIC printed in large yellow letters, a pair of Joo Janta 200 Super-Chromatic Peril-Sensitive Sunglasses, No Tea, and your very own Microscopic Space Fleet. All this can be yours, for the low, low price of only 59.99 Altairian Dollars.</resource>

The poker variant of choice is Draw Poker. The gameplay is similar to most other games of this kind: the player chooses one of four girls and plays poker against her. If he runs out of money, the game is lost - if she runs out of money, she loses a part of her clothes. If she is successful, she can buy back a part of her wardrobe. The AI adapts to the player's style, but this is only true within the same match.</resource>

This is a job for yourself as the local policeman but you have a problem, all the vehicles have been hidden by the criminals and all that is left is a Space Hopper to bounce around town and catch them all within a time limit.

The game is viewed from the side as you move either left or right along the streets with the screen scrolling as you move. There are various street openings shown by a map of the street above the playing area. You are also able to see any criminals on the same street. At the bottom of the screen is a location of a crime and you can also see your location and a clock ticking down. You move about the streets in search of the criminals and if you find one then you bounce on top of him. Three of the four criminals are armed which are a club, tacks and a gun. Get hit by the gun and the tacks and you lose one of three lives. The club will just stun you and lose you valuable time.</resource>

    <resource id="dee7d0b5c54ec065837adc4a4003ec3dc1d54ba8" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Hot Rod is a top-view racing game influenced by Super Sprint, in which three miniature cars race to complete a race as quickly as possible, by rotating, accelerating and braking at the right moments. You start with limited fuel, but more can be collected as you cover the track. Hitting hazards can cause your car to explode, thus costing time as it is replaced.

Unusually the racetracks are linear rather than lap-based, so each round involves covering a section of track once. After each race, you can purchase upgrades at the shop, depending on how much money you earned in the previous race.

Only part of the circuit is shown at a time, and this scrolls following the leader. If you fail to keep up with this, your car is moved forward on the track, with a penalty fuel deduction. This is slightly similar to the system later used in head-to-head games of Micro Machines, and is especially punishing while you are on roads travelling horizontally and the leading CPU car is travelling vertically, as it makes the margin for error much smaller.</resource>

The aim of the game is to destroy your own bricks before your opponent can destroy his. This is achieved by catching the small by pointing your suction device at it and holding fire, and then releasing in the needed by letting go of the button. This is easier said than done, as the ball neither moves in a straight line or according to the natural rules of.gravity.

Should either player be hit with the ball and not catch it properly, they will be knocked down and possession of the ball is passed to the other player.</resource>

Having gate-crashed a party full of sophisticated well-behaved types, you must do everything you can to be seen as hateful, yobbish and immature – a Complete Bastard.

The house has several rooms, each of which are filled with objects which are of use, as well as unlimited supplies of food, alcohol and coffee, which control how drunk you are at a time – some awful actions force you to be sober, others force you to be drunk. The game also displays whether you need the toilet (or, more accurately, any part of the house that would cause offence), whether you need to fart, and how strong-smelling these are.

The rooms can all be viewed from multiple angles, and 2 can be viewed at a time through a split-screen view.

To win, you need to prove to all 16 party guest that you are a complete bastard.</resource>

The mission will take him through a mansion, castles, rooftops, subways, and the Vatican. Of course, getting all these items will not be as easy as it sounds.

Some people are taking the idea to extremes, plunging into danger just to prove that they are really tough and a lot stupider than the rest. 

In this game, players control Kwon, dubbed the Human Killing Machine. He has vowed to demonstrate the power of his homeland; and does this by battling a series of opponents in several countries such as Moscow, Amsterdam, and Barcelona. HKM uses the term 'knockdown' for players who defeat their current opponent. Three knockdowns are needed for the player to move onto the next opponent.

Bonus points are awarded for the remaining energy Kwon has when he has successfully defeated his opponent. The player has five lives, and if all of them are used up, the game is over.</resource>

In each wave you must destroy every alien so that it will drop a B icon, and when a certain amount has been collected before they touch the ground you can then face a final wave to destroy. As you move and shoot around the level, you must avoid touching the aliens or their weapons as this decreases an energy gauge faster which is slowly decreasing. When your energy gauge empties then you lose one of four lives. Allowing a B icon to hit the ground also decreases the gauge but some destroyed waves of aliens drops a F icon and when collected fills your energy gauge. Once you have completed a level then you have the chance to get bonus points by collecting all the numbered ions in order before your energy gauge empties but if you collect an icon in the wrong order then the bonus part is over and it's on to the next level.</resource>

What should be a simple task is made difficult by atomic bombs that drop from block to block so get hopping Humphrey.

Humphrey is a Q*Bert variant. Like in Q*Bert, Humphrey hops from block to block, changing the color of any block he lands on. When all the block's colors are changed, he moves to the next level. Making life difficult are atomic bombs that start at the top and bounce down the board. When they drop off the bottom, they reappear at the top. If Humphrey hits or is hit by an atomic bomb, he loses a life and the current level resets to the beginning. When all lives are gone, the game is over. Unlike Q*Bert, enemies only move down, not up. As the game progresses, there will be more bombs and they will have more bounces.</resource>

Once you get the hang of any individual obstacle, the game starts throwing them at you in tandem, until toward the end you're tracking the swing of the rope, the thrust of the lance, the approach of the arrow and the advance of the knight all simultaneously!  Succeed, against all odds, and you get to do it again, but faster!  Even an able-bodied protagonist would have a hard time juggling all these threats, but I have a feeling a dedicated player with patience and good timing can overcome them.  Let's call it a hunch.</resource>

Gathering all the bells permits you to advance higher up the tower, at the top of which the damsel in distress awaits your homely visage.</resource>

    <resource id="9ab6a01f1f1041bf14b630e78bd337c2f54f66b6" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">After flying your trusty ship Hunter too close to a black hole, you find yourself lost in space on the wrong side of the galaxy, surrounded by sprawling, hive-like cities. At the core of each city lie mysterious alien Starcells – these contain valuable navigational data and must be collected to plot a course back home.

The aim of each level is to blast through the hive and grab the Starcells, a task made more challenging by the invincible Worker cells which patrol the cities repairing any damage inflicted. These Workers also bring the hive's defenses to life, causing them to spew deadly spores that can only be resisted by using your ship's trusty Perma-Shields.

The game features over 180 levels spread across 21 star systems. When all the Starcells on a level have been collected you'll enter the Bonus Game where you can earn a Perma-Shield and an extra life. You must complete every level within each star system to advance to the next; however, should you manage to collect four flashing Starcells you'll automatically jump to the next system.

As you progress through the different star systems you'll encounter an array of diverse and challenging hive types, including Attackers that throw out deadly spores, Darkcells which are only visible on radar, Switchers that change direction without warning, Jumpgates which jump to random locations, and Blackouts which plunge the hives into darkness.

Do you have the dexterity, precision timing and psychopathic blasting skills to find your way home to Hunter's Moon...?</resource>

The gaol wasn't built to keep them in but to stop people and aliens getting in to attempt a rescue mission. The gaol is starting to struggle to hold them so the aliens need to be destroyed. The only way to do this is by sending a team of droids in. The gaol is full of other creatures and defences all put in place to stop anyone getting in, these include Cannons, mines, electro wire and many types of creatures. There are three types of droids, The Brain, The Robot and The Xylon, each with different powers and abilities like switching bridges on, high fire power and teleporting. Once the droids reach a certain cell in the complex together they unite and become a 'Hybrid' where they are transported to a cell of an alien to destroy it. Once the alien is destroyed then they are transported back to the complex and another three aliens need to be found and destroyed to save Earth. The game is viewed from above and the Amstrad and Spectrum versions are flick screen while the C64 version is a scrolling game. The joystick or keyboard is used to control the droids and to switch between them.</resource>

Choose your three-man team from a pool of 10 players, each with slightly different stats for strength, agility and speed. The teams have to pass and catch a ball and shoot it to a moving basket in the middle of the screen. Two players are in the air (one in each half of the arena), while the third remains on the ground to collect an otherwise-dead ball. You simultaneously control the grounder and the air player nearer the ball - they move left and right in unison, but only the air player responds to up-down movements. Players can only hold possession for 2.5 seconds, in order to keep the games fast and frantic.</resource>

The full sequence of events is - swimming, skeet shooting, gymnastics, archery, triple jumping and weightlifting. You must complete each event in order to be allowed onto the next one.

Swimming involves moving left and right as fast as possible, while pressing fire when a breath is required. Skeet shooting and archery both come down to timing - though elevation and wind factors affect the latter. Gymnastics involves timing a succession of presses to ensure that the jump is long and the landing graceful. The triple jump involves one press for each part of the jump, whereas the weightlifting involves merely brute strength.</resource>

Each player controls one of the 10 available spaceships, each with their own subtle strengths and weaknesses in terms of speed, inertia and fire direction. A scanner shows the positions of both ships and the ball, so that things don't become disorientating.

The aim is to guide the ball either into a 'goal' in the middle of each end (scoring 2 points) or onto the goal-line elsewhere (scoring one point). The ball can be steered either by hitting it with the ship or by shooting at it with your craft's beam (which does not injure or impede the opposition craft in any way). In either case the ball moves in a semi-random direction similar to the one you directed it in, but can rebound off the plus-shaped divots in the wall unexpectedly.

The game lasts for 5 minutes, or until a player reaches the winning score of 9. Each of the three skills levels is a 5-tier tournament of increasing difficulty.</resource>

Most enemy ships are not lethal in themselves, but have either the ability to shoot up, down, or sideways. To defeat them, you can shoot upwards or push them towards the edge of the screen.

Monty must trek through five worlds to retrieve the sacred scrolls of the race's Guardians. 

As with Core's previous hit Rick Dangerous 2 there is versatility in the exact structure of the game. The first four consist of the Orient, a Klondike mine, an Ice world and an Amazon forest - once these are completed the final world is open to you.

The platform-based gameplay is similar to Monty's earlier games, with primarily horizontal progresses as well as ropes and ladders to navigate. Monty has developed a useful flying kick, and has been given a smart bomb, with the potential to collect extra bombs and guns. Hazards, enemies and level designs are themed around each level, and range from cable cars and falling snowballs to Ninjas and Monkeys.</resource>

In this action game based around the film, you take control of these five guys in turn, with the chance to switch between them as they each take one of the 3 hits that would kill them.

The game recreates each of the sections of the film, starting with a side-scrolling journey through the jungle, with paths to cross both horizontally and vertically, and the ability to jump or duck hazards. You will need to blow up a bridge and then locate a village, which contains a torch, a map and a trap-door. The enemy has booby-trapped the area and are launching airstrikes, so the danger is not all from enemy ground soldiers.

The next section is in first-person 3D, as you move through a network of tunnels in search of flares and a compass. There are 3 distinct control methods, changing from the standard motion when an enemy appears (this puts you in control of a cross-hair for more accurate targeting), and when you enter a room to search.

After escaping this you settle in a bunker overnight, and have a limited amount of flares with which to locate incoming enemy, and must then shoot them before they can shoot you. The jungle airstrike from the film is the next moment - you have two minutes to rush into a safe position to the north, using your compass for guidance.

Finally you face the treacherous Sergeant Barnes, and must hit him with grenades 5 times whilst trapped in a foxhole to prevent him wiping you out.</resource>

Use your whip to swing across chasms, climb ladders, ride along conveyor belts and defend yourself against attacks from Thuggee guards, bats, snakes and the fireball-throwing Mola ram. Escape with the mine cart after you've freed all children.
2. Mine cart level: Pick the right route through a network of tracks while riding in a mine cart. Avoid potholes, broken tracks &amp; guards in carts and safely reach the end of the track.
3. Temple level: Make your way to the altar and grab the Sankara stone while Mola Ram, bats and Thuggee guards attack you. Watch out for that lava.
With every cycle the mine &amp; mine cart levels become more complex, the layout of the temple levels is always the same. After several cycles there's a showdown with Mola Ram on the rope bridge.</resource>

Each game has computer opponents at multiple skill levels plus human-versus-human and demo modes, and matches can consist of varying numbers of rounds, with other options depending on the game.

Ten-pin bowling is played from a side-on view, although once the shot has been taken you see the results unfold from the bowler's view. There are three stages to taking a shot. Move the player up and down to line up his run-up, pressing fire to set the position. Then, do the same to set the angle of the shot. Finally, after pressing fire to start the run-up, press it again to time the release of the ball, as close to the line as possible.

Darts has 4 skill and 3 speed levels, and players can play to 301, 501 or 701, to vary game length or provide a handicapping system. You can also set whether scoring must start or end with a double. Viewed from behind the board, you must first line up the dart, then set the dart's curvature and power by stopping a curved gauge on the right, then a rising power bar on the left. The view then changes twice - first a behind-the-player view to show the dart's approach, then a close-up of the board to show where it landed.

Air Hockey plays for five minutes, or until someone has scored 12 points. The view is above the pitch but angled so as to emphasize the goal at the top.

Ping-Pong features a handicapping system - six ability areas can be graded from 1-5, to ensure a closely-matched game. Again the view is from behind one court. To impart direction onto a shot, the angle must be pressed at the same time as the fire button.</resource>

The game is broken up in to two parts: Walking around in the enemy camp, or flying missions in your advanced attack helicopter. You can enter enemy huts in the compound and retrieve weapons and information. Use gas grenades on the guards to give yourself time to search rooms.

Flying your attack chopper presents you with a view out the cockpit and control panel. You will be attacked by numerous airplanes and can attack ground defense systems too.</resource>

The action is viewed from the side, although kicks to the posts are played from a behind-the-posts perspective. Scrums and line-outs are incorporated for as realistic a game as possible given the player restriction. A tournament can be played with up to 8 players, with as many computer teams as required to fill the gaps.

In the ST version the tactical side of the game is very complex - seventeen different formations are on offer. Other gameplay variables can be set - player stamina (lower values forcing you to play a more conservative game), how long a player takes to recover from a tackle, and the standard strengths of passes and kicks, pus some very complicated mathematical coefficients. The ability to rename teams, change kits and alter the match lengths seem banal by comparison.</resource>

Just as the dust was clearing after the stampede of footy games, it is time for the Olympics and the inevitable onslaught of athletics games. Lucky for Empire, their International Sports Challenge has two things going for it ? it is the first one out, and it has got some weird events in it. Sure it has got the usual dose of joystick waggling (in the swimming and cycling events), but among the six events (okay, so it is not exactly a full Olympic sim) are show jumping, and ? yes! ? skeet shooting ? always one of my faves on the sports games of yesteryear.

It is possible to play each event individually, but of course these games are all about doing the entire thing, preferably competing against a friend of two. The formula for the whole lot goes something like this ? diving, shooting, cycling, swimming and show jumping are all played as in-between events, with a strategy- based marathon even enveloping them all. This marathon does not require a single joystick waggle, instead requiring players to balance rhythm with speed, top-up energy, avoid dehydration, all that kind of stuff.

The lack of events is partially compensated for by the game's flexibility, with several variations in each event upping lastability and game time. Empire reckon there are 2000 event variations to try out, and while I doubt you would want to try out every single combination, International Sports Challenge offers a decent amount of fun for yer money, for a team of players at least. I have got my doubts about its value as a single player game though, and the water events really are tedious. But at least it tries to be a little different, and anyway, I am a sucker for multiplayer games.</resource>

After choosing a country to compete with, you select seven people from a list to compete in the five sports. Once happy with your selection you can then place them into the sports but taking into consideration how many can play in that sport and each person having enough sports to play in. Once you have your teams selected you can now participate in the various sports against the other countries in various rounds to become champions. The team sports you compete in are:

Water Polo: A match is viewed from the side at an elevated angle showing a part of the swimming pool with the screen scrolling left or right when the ball moves. Three out field players and a goaltender compete to score the most goals over four periods to win the match.

Indoor Soccer: A match is viewed from the side at an elevated angle showing a part of the pitch with the screen scrolling left or right when the ball moves. Three out field players and a goalkeeper compete to score the most goals over two halves to win the match.

Volleyball: A match is shown behind the court at an elevated angle as three players compete against three players over a number of sets.

4x100m Swimming Relay: The swimming pool is shown from the side at an elevated angle with the screen scrolling as the leading swimmer swims. Each swimmer must swim two laps before the next swimmer dives in. The winner is the team with all four swimmers finishing first.

4x400m Relay: A race is shown from above with part of the track shown and the screen scrolls with the leading runner. Each runner must carry a baton for a lap around a track and pass it onto the next runner. The winning team is the team that completes the four laps first.</resource>

You walk around from an early first-person view with 90 degree movement and four views from each position, aided by a map. On the first level you must touch nine ghosts, to collect pieces of a key to know which of the objects you will later find are medicines, and which are potions.

While on level 2, you must visit information sites - you will need this to survive on level 3. These are guarded by spiders, which must be trapped and lured away using doors. To move between levels you must guide a mechanical lift, by moving the joystick in smooth circles from inside it. This final level contains familiar safe bottles as well as poisonous ones - all stored on hidden shelves. It also contains zombies to avoid or trap.

Before you can reach the emerald, you must solve a final puzzle involving hieroglyphs. Arrange a 4x4 grid so as to get the rows and columns to match, within 40 moves.</resource>

Fame, glory and bikini clad women await your victories and the taste of dirt awaits if you fail. Let a computer car beat you and you lose one of your 3 credits.

Successful races bring more money, which can be used to soup up their machine. Boosts to top speed, grip and acceleration can be purchased, and your nitro boost must be kept topped up. If you are desperate for upgrades, you can buy into your spare credits.

Only your off-road driving abilities will be enough to pull you to first place in these races. Play alone or with up to 3 other players (depending on the version) in this classic arcade game.</resource>

    <resource id="7f46c28e4ba23c41b0dff093eaae3557acfc490c" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Jack Attack is a platform action game for the Commodore 64 released on cartridge by Commodore in 1983. A version for the Commodore 16 and Commodore Plus/4 was also released in 1984. The game was named after Commodore's founder Jack Tramiel.

Each level is laid out in a rectangular grid. The levels contain the player character, eight enemies, and a varying arrangement of blocks. The player's goal is to kill all the enemies without being killed by them. There are 64 levels in all.

The player character is able to push and pull blocks, which the player must use to kill the enemies and navigate the platforms. An enemy can be killed by being crushed either horizontally between two blocks or by the player character or a block falling down on it. On the other hand, the player character dies if a block or an enemy falls on top of it. Enemies are unable to push or pull blocks. Some levels include water, which is fatal to the player character, but safe to enemies.

While killing all enemies completes the levels, some levels also add bonuses for jumping on every platform. These platforms disappear after a set time limit and are usually only accessible by arranging the blocks in a certain way adding a puzzle element to the game. A time bonus is also awarded for quickly completing a level.</resource>

He starts with nine lives but no weapons, although a supply of coconuts to lob is close at hand.

The jungle is full of snakes, monkeys, birds and all manner of other creatures, all of which must be avoided or killed - remember that their attack paths are pre-programmed, and the trajectory of your coconuts is quite limited. Travelling through the levels involves, amongst other things, ladders, mine carts, trees, ropes and logs.

As well as simply completing the game and amassing as many points as possible, you can aim to be as naughty as possible, which is gauged by a 'Naughty-O-Meter' next to the score, with numerous objects available for that purpose (one can be carried at a time, alongside one weapon).</resource>

After accidentally killing someone, you become a suspect. You must prove that you are innocent, without the police hauling you in as they search for a scapegoat.

Jack the Ripper is interactive fiction with occasional graphics, based closely on real events of the Ripper. The parser accepts full sentences, and instructions can be qualified with adverbs such as 'slowly' and 'quietly'.  The game is split into three parts, including digitised graphics (of the author's sisters) representing Ripper victims.</resource>

Being held in P.O.W. camps, these soldiers are effectively out of the war... unless some kind of rescue operation can be mounted. Heavy Forces are too slow and visible to be of any use, but perhaps something smaller and lighter may make it in where larger forces would fail. A small jeep, maybe two, crewed by about 4 people.... minimal enough not to represent too much of a loss and yet suitable enough to aid in rescue. But of course, if these brave men want to succeed AND come back alive; they'll need to fight like animals... they'll need to fight like jackals...

Jackal is an overhead view jeep game for up to 2 players. The controller moves in four directions, button A fires your gernades (upgradable to bazooka) and button B your machine gun which ALWAYS fires to the top of the screen. Your mission is to locate facilities where soldiers are being held prisoner, rescue as many as possible, and escort them to a safe landing zone where they will be air transported away. After that, you'll need to fight a boss battle against the enemy to progress.</resource>

As a policeman, the object of the game is to fire on escaped convicts who have taken the warden hostage, and in order to do this, you must make your way through downtown streets, a park, a bridge, and eventually, a prison. By rescuing hostages along the way, you can obtain a number of weapons, such as a pistol and a tear gas gun, and you can select them by using the weapons select area at the bottom of the screen. Be careful: If you shoot any hostages, you will lose whatever weapons that you have.</resource>

Hit an obstacle, gap or a weapon and you lose one of five lives and sent back a certain distance. On screen there is also a map showing how much of the territory you have completed.</resource>

An evil despot has bought one of the moons and installed a powerful reactor. Unless he is given control of all the moons, he threatens to blow up the reactor, irradiating all the minerals and making them worthless.

Enter the Jet-Boys, an elite security force protecting the Saturn system. Armed with their jetpacks and laser guns, they must now face the despot's organic and mechanical minions, enter his space fortress and destroy the reactor.

Jet-Boys is a horizontally scrolling scrolling shoot 'em up. The player takes control of a Jet-Boy and must destroy wave upon wave of enemy warriors across four levels. Power-ups fly across the screen allowing the Jet-Boy to upgrade his weapons, shields and gain extra speed. 

Every enemy destroyed counts towards a timer. At the end of each level, a boss enemy must be destroyed within the time limit gained during the level.

The can be played by two players simultaneously, each controlling one Jet-Boy.</resource>

Having struck it lucky in the first game, Willy now owns a lavish mansion with over 60 rooms linked in a 3D plane, and must tidy it all before his housekeeper will let him sleep.

Each room has its own hazards, such as spikes, revolving razors and ropes. The route through the house must be navigated carefully, due to the multiple entrances to some rooms - this is perhaps the first action game where mapping is an advantage. Another innovation, to the chagrin of players everywhere, is manual protection - a sheet of colour-coded numbers.</resource>

And you need a change of luck, because events in this game often emphasise the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune. You get hit by a car, fall a great height, sprayed with cheese sandwich and more! Being the guinea pig in this strange world will drive you insane - if this jinxed land doesn't do it first. 

Jinxter is an interactive fiction with graphics title that takes a realistic world of people and situations, and then plays with the boundaries to create a strange and puzzling world. Characters are all getting on with their own tasks, and getting them to help you is usually a case of making sure something's in it for them.

Dialogue aims to add a comic touch to proceedings. Puzzles can often be solved in multiple ways, but the most obvious way is not always the correct one. Due to the presence of a Guardian, you can't actually die.</resource>

During gameplay, the whole of the board is seen. The dart cursor swirls around the screen, can be controlled in a limited fashion and is released by pressing fire.</resource>

Innocent civilians who leave the house will almost certainly face violence. An acclaimed hero since his successes in the original, Joe Blade is the man to put things right - if he can kill 100 thugs and rescue 20 civilians within ten minutes, the thugs will retreat and the city will be saved.

As Joe, you must move through the streets and kill these thugs, by kicking them in the head (they have body armour). As in the first game, the streets are flick-screen and have many doorways linking them. Rescuing civilians involves touching them before completing a sub-game within a minute.

There are four subgame variants of increasing difficulty, all based around a 1-2-3-4 sequence of numbers. The first involves simply stopping the cursor as each one appears in order - pressing the wrong one sends you back to having to find a 1. In the second, the numbers are on screen in random order, a cursor cycling through them - press fire to swap the two numbers currently highlighted. In the third, you are presented with two jumbled sets and must put one of them in order, by swapping numbers across the two sets. In the fourth, you must form the sequence by swapping an ever-changing number into the right place, by pressing fire at the right moment.</resource>

    <resource id="bddcb1d637db015f02287f5a89c66c103674304d" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Johnny Reb is a turn-based strategy game for one or two players, based on the American Civil War. Players can control an army of either the Union or the Confederation.

There are three types of units: infantry, cavalry and artillery, and it's possible to decide how many of each type the player's army should consist of. After the initial set-up, the battlefield is generated. The goal is to capture the enemy's flag, but it's also possible to achieve a victory by points. Army control is handled with the keyboard - units can move in eight directions. Artillery can shoot over distance, the other unit types can directly attack by simply moving to an adjacent square.</resource>

For the first time in the series' history, side-scrolling mazes were introduced, with each maze being two screens wide.

This time, the mazes have no exit tunnels through which players can make an escape. The bonus items that appear move around the maze and are now something of a mixed blessing, as not only will they destroy any Power Pills they come across, but they will also turn any normal dots they pass over into large dots that slow the player's movements considerably, but are worth more points than normal dots if eaten by the player. Any mutated dots in the maze will disappear if the player loses a life.

The Pac character is once again pursued by four ghosts (Blinky, Pinky, Inky and Tim) in his quest to eat all of the dots in each maze. And, as before, numerous Power Pills litter the mazes that, when eaten, allow Jr. to eat the pursuing ghosts.

As with previous &amp;quot;Pac-Man&amp;quot; games, intermissions are featured between certain levels. Jr. Pac-Man's intermissions are episodic in nature.</resource>

Players take the role of nobles in the Holy Roman Empire and compete for the crown of the emperor. One to nine players can play, beginning by entering their name and gender and being assigned a state in the empire. Gameplay then takes place in turns, each consisting of a number of consecutive screens. In the first screen, players can sell and buy grain and land. Grain is necessary to feed a noble's subjects. Bad weather can result in harvest losses, making it necessary to buy extra grain to prevent starvation. Providing more grain than necessary increases population growth and the state's reputation. Acquiring more land increases population and is necessary for economic growth. Following the trading screen is a statistics screen, displaying births and deaths, immigration and emigration as well as income and expenses. The third screen allows control of income. Players can set taxes and tariffs and can determine how harshly the justice system works - setting it to a level that is too brutal might increase income in the short term but also lead to increased emigration. Another overview screen follows, displaying a player's lands and properties in detail. The fifth screen allows for spending the turn's income. It is possible to buy marketplaces and grain mills (both of which increase income) as well as construct part of a palace or a cathedral (both of which have no direct use but are required to move into the highest levels of nobility). Each building option requires owning a certain amount of land. Constructing five marketplaces and three mills results in the creation of a city.</resource>

Through two holes in the ground you must blast the wasps and hornets that move across the screen advancing downwards, either side of the cactus, to stop them eating the bottom of the cactus.</resource>

The first level involves shooting at birds, with a minimum of 3 required to progress. You must aim in front of the birds, so as to allow for the distance they will cover as the bullet travels. In the third level you are now shooting at bad guys, who emerge from locations (bank, saloon, store) on an accurate Wild West layout.

The second level sees you attempting to jump over rocks and cacti, whereas level 4 involves jumping across a speeding train in order to wrestle control of it.</resource>

In Kane II, it is up to McGraw to once again save the town of Kane, over the course of four stages. In the first, McGraw rides his horse alongside a train to shoot at bad guys, then he has a shootout with the Black Hole Gang at Fort Apache to rescue the Indian princess. Once he has done this, he tames his new bronco to be his new companion, and finally, he must escape the clutches of the Black Hole Gang and ride off into the sunset.</resource>

A full point or half a point is awarded for knocking your opponent down and the first player to gain a two point lead wins the round. Should the 30 second time limit for a round end, the player who has the most points wins. At the end of each match is a bonus round where the victor can earn extra points by knocking down flying objects that are tossed his way.</resource>

This Lost Treasure of Babylon is being guarded by the evil dragon Ryu. While the gameplay is basically the same as the other versions, the story for the Famicom version is different. It involves Karnov, who comes from a small town called Cleamina, being called by God to be his envoy. Karnov is tasked with getting rid of the evil troublemaker known as Alakatai.

Karnov features nine stages of side-scrolling action.  Karnov's main attack is to breathe fireballs at his enemies.  Karnov can collect power-up orbs which can increase the amount of fire he can breathe out. Karnov is also able to jump, with the height being increased by collecting boots. Other items Karnov can carry and use include bombs, ladders, boomerangs, clappers (which destroy minor enemies that are currently on the screen instantaneously), and shields. Occasionally, Karnov will be able to make use of certain items such as wings which let him fly in the air and a scuba gear helmet which lets him swim underwater. Also, scattered throughout the stages are K icons. Collecting 50 of these will reward Karnov an extra life.</resource>

It was once a paradise for researchers, scientists and inventors, who developed machinery with advanced artificial intelligence. However, the machines eventually evolved beyond the control of their human creators and overtook the planet. The humans attempted to retaliate through the use of nuclear ballistic missiles, but the machines survived.

The player must pilot a DS-H75 Eaglefighter, which can be upgraded with a satellite and various weapons, through 12 levels, each containing a huge end-boss, to restore peace to the planet. Collisions with asteroids, flying enemies, ground troops and the background need to be avoided. Katakis can be played in co-op with one player controlling the ship and another controlling the indestructible Force module.</resource>

This was his second licensed game, and is a side-scrolling action game featuring single matches played between a team in red and a team in blue, each of which can be any of 9 skill levels. Matches can be varied between 10 and 90 minutes. The ball is loosely controlled in a manner similar to the Kick off series, although it isn’t possible to pass the ball a short distance, so an element of hitting and hoping comes into play, especially as the ball can’t be curved far. The ball bounces quite heavily, and is very difficult to shoot on target from closer than 30 yards or so.</resource>

    <resource id="8e0ab306306e38fdf9aac0c41a568bd4ce61aa0e" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">By 1989 Kenny Dalglish scarcely played for Liverpool, and was almost entirely concentrating on his role as manager, so a football management game with no arcade action featuring his license made sense. The game is purely icon- and menu-driven, perhaps the first step in dragging the genre into the 90s. Whichever team you took charge of start from the 4th division. Match highlights can be selected - these are viewed from the side and show goals and near-misses, although they can be turned off.

You start with squads of over 20 players from which to choose your team of 11, each given a straightforward ability rating. Formations can be selected by placing each player in a precise position alongside the formation of the opposition team, using a fairly advanced system for the time. Via a separate menu you can consult with the chairman (to see if he's happy with your efforts), the physio (to check for injuries), the scout (who comes up with players you might like to purchase) and so on.</resource>

Each player controls a team of 11 figures which are ordered on four bars for each one (1 goalkeeper, 2 defenders, 5 midfielders, 3 forwards). You can control only one bar at a time. The ball is kicked by rotating the figures on the current bar left or right. Game length isn't time-limited but depends on the total number of goals scored. After four goals have been scored players will switch side and the game will last until another four goals have been scored.</resource>

    <resource id="5084d34f89037bb188583ec259c2826ad1fcc357" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">The original Kick Off was expanded on in many ways for this sequel. The game now features full tournament modes (although the players on the teams are fictitious) and four different pitches (including an implementation of plastic pitches, whose uneven bounce cause controversy when several British clubs tried them in the 1980s).

Viewed top-down, the controls involve trapping the ball under your foot, giving you time to prepare passes. Running with the ball is tricky at first, as it doesn't stick to your foot the way it did in contemporary football games. Complex moves such as overhead kicks, back-heels and long-range through-ball passes can be completed with practice.</resource>

This can be done by moving left and right to catch them all on the head. Further on, you've to form columns instead of popping them. These columns have a nasty habit by getting each time higher and will give you a lesser time to react.

However, if you're close enough to the balloon you can kick the balloon and try again. Another way is to catch the 'Pac-Man' that comes down between the balloons. This will eat the balloons that falls on your head. If you miss you'll fall from your unicycle.</resource>

    <resource id="ded9f33ef5d17e491f3103fff8c4fe1bdc910a35" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Killed Until Dead is a sophisticated mystery game with a leaning towards humor. The player has to solve every aspect of a murder case before it happens. The five biggest mystery writers in the world have gathered together at a hotel and one of them will be offing another unless Hercule Holmes can crack the case.  

Gameplay is a cross between the board-game Clue and the paper-based logic puzzles in which the player must eliminate clues in sequence. To solve the forthcoming murder, you will have to search the suspects' rooms and confront them with the evidence and set the hotel's security cameras to record secret meetings. 

By questioning the suspects as to what they know about certain people, rooms and objects, they may reveal combinations they know will not be involved in the murder - perhaps if it involves the gun, the killer will not be Lord Peter Flimsey, for example.  However, there's a catch. If he accuses the wrong suspect, he might be the one who's Killed Until Dead - they don't take kindly to false accusation.</resource>

There are foes to avoid or shoot – some take objects you have but most merely drain some of your energy. Some walls can also be shot out. Some rooms have white spots which affect gravity and drag you inwards.

Avoid contact with red walls as these drain energy; all others are harmless. There are teleporters to help you navigate the game, and power-ups which remove the complex physics.</resource>

    <resource id="300fd7a33e8d2663be4cac7a61914bbd8d2ed0c8" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">The player can play as Sinjin Smith and Randy Stoklos. The features three modes of play; practice, match play and tournament. In the latter, you progress through five beaches (San Diego, Chicago, Waikiki, Rio de Janeiro, and Australia) filled with increasingly challenging opponents as you attempt to win it all. While Smith and Stoklos are joined by Ron Von Hagen, Tim Hovland and Mike Dodd as the only 'real' volleyball players featured in the game, EA spiced up the competition with some notorious characters from other games, including Hard Hat Mack and Lester from Skate or Die and Ski or Die. The gameplay controls for the console version are fairly simplistic, with the directional pad and two buttons doing all the work. In the PC version, players control three actions, bump, set, block/spike. Diving for the ball occurs automatically. The only 'advanced' moves in the game are the ability to dink or perform a one-handed Kong block (Stoklos' trademark). Another endearing feature of the game is the ability to 'argue' calls with the referee, which occasionally allows players to get a point overturned. However, if players argue too much, the referee may penalize them with a red card and deduct a point.</resource>

Two are shooting games. The Crossbow event involves moving a crosshair so as to hit one of an array of rotating targets. Once you've mastered this you are ready for Archery - this time you must hit targets which move from left to right, so timing is more important.

The other six involve one-on-one combat. There are two sword-fighting battles against different backdrops; in each of them you must make 10 hits to get your opponent down, and do that 10 times to win overall. Time your jabs and shields to achieve this.

The other four events follow the same formula, but with slightly different weapons. The Quartermast event is on a log, although the action is still only 2-dimensional. Ball &amp; Chain, Axe and Pike battles complete the set. All can be played by 2 human players.</resource>

He must find a way back to his own time.

Knight Tyme is the third game of the Magic Knight series. As in Spellbound, the previous game, the player interacts with the environment through the &amp;quot;Windimation&amp;quot; system: pressing a button brings up a window with a list of commands (pick up/drop/take/give an object, examine, command a character, read something, cast a spell and wear/unwear object). The player can scroll through these with the movement keys, and execute them with the same button used before. Spaceflight is part of the gameplay as the ship must visit several different planets. The spaceship has to be refueled, otherwise the character will be stuck forever in space. There are rooms that kill the knight instantaneously. Usually there is a puzzle associated with these rooms that must be solved in order to access them.</resource>

In the first licensed game you have been trapped in Damonia Castle and must somehow escape.

Viewed in 3D, you move your character around the rooms, while most other actions are activated using a verb-noun command system. By pressing the first letter of the first word (open, close, dig and so on) and pressing enter once you've got the right word, you can then choose the second word (options are context-sensitive; for example 'door' only appears if you stand near one). 

Plenty of puzzles must be solved along the way. Two advisers are present, one good and one bad, but each time you call for advice only one will answer, and you have to work out for yourself whether the clue is kosher. 

Your health is indicated by a candle graphic, the higher this is the healthier you are. You start without weaponry or spells, but these can be collected and used, including a rain cloud to freeze everything, Casper the magic key, and a cast-iron anvil to crush all evil.</resource>

As one of the few to refuse such treatment, you escape, and must find your way to freedom, through the six areas of the city, and ultimately through the city walls. You have a limited amount of time to finally escape from the city, as it is set to self-destruct. Enemies to take on with your punches and kicks include the guards and five other Re-Formed people. You must find enough food and water to sustain you as you go, as well as keys to escape and bonus items (often hidden) such as extra energy and points bonuses.</resource>

If you hit a car or an obstacle then you lose a life (four on the C64, five on the Amstrad CPC, one on the Zx Spectrum). Once you reach the girl then it's on to the next level.</resource>

The Ancients abandoned the planet, leaving behind many different artifacts and ships, which you can loot. Send your droid to retrieve modules and try to figure out what the ancient technology is for. It could be batteries, shields or even weapons, to help you fight the trigger-happy saucers that want you dead.

The game uses fractal graphics, the terrain is vast and detailed, and the story behind it is quite complex, considering the type of game.</resource>

The gameplay is divided up into different types of mental skill including Observation in which you are told a story and shown a picture. The story is then told again but with subtle changes along with the picture which alters. You must then type in what text has changed and also what has altered on the picture. There are also mathematical puzzles involving you remembering a sequence and working out the sum quickly as the clock is ticking away. As the game progresses there are also physical tasks to do including moving the Ergobuggy around a course and finishing off with a general knowledge quiz.</resource>

But to be able to enter the treasure caverns, the player is required to collect certain keys, and open the doors in which the key's color matches the border's. These keys are collected in other rooms. If the right key is obtained, the player is able to pass through the doors, enter the cavern, and get the treasure. While searching the rooms, you can also get swords that you can use to kill snakes, bats, spiders, and mummies; and the torches to see. Besides treasures, other things that you can get in the caverns are pixie boots which you can get for extra speed, and two potions - one for teleportation, one for invincibility. There are eight levels in the game, and going up ladders take you to the next level.</resource>

Sixteen different moves are on offer, ranging from standard kicks to jumps, somersaults and roundhouse kicks.

The move executed each time is defined based on the character's direction, the joystick/keyboard positioning, and on whether the fire button is depressed, in a system which became standard on single-button control systems.

To win each bout you must score 2 Yin-Yangs - a perfectly executed kick/punch scores a full one, whereas a less forceful contact offers half a point - the best moves also offer more points. In the one-player game, you advance through a Dan by winning two successive bouts, and a single win for the opponent means game over. The champion in a two-player duel is decided by points after 4 rounds.</resource>

Mr. X has captured the pickpocket Sylvia and it is up to Thomas, a kung-fu master who owns a restaurant, to get her back. She is located on the top floor of Mr. X's castle and Thomas will need to fight his way to the top. Of course, this won't be easy as each floor has many opponents to get past and a floor boss at the end of each level. 

Thomas is able to move left and right, jump, duck, and punch and kick. Enemy projectiles such as knives can be kicked in the air to rebound them towards the enemy. On the top floor resides Mr. X himself.</resource>

Like Fast Food it doesn't directly resemble the main series of arcade adventures, instead being a single-screen action game, resembling Pengo. The basic idea is to move around a maze of blocks collecting fruit, but the twist in the style is that you push the blocks in the maze to kill or trap those enemies. After every level is completed a short bonus screen appears where more fruit can be collected. During play various other tokens are released, such as bonus points, a smart bomb and control reversal.</resource>

As the game progresses the levels become harder with progressively more ostriches in the arena and shorter hatching times for the eggs.</resource>

It brings to the table an immersive gameplay environment as well as many innovative ideas that weren't available in any other game of the time.

In Laser Squad you control a group of &amp;quot;marine&amp;quot;-like soldiers (and the occasional cyborg). Before taking them into battle, you must buy them weapons and armour with a predetermined amount of credits, taking into account the individual abilities of your squad. Unlike X-COM, the soldiers do not gain experience over time.

There are 3 missions in turn - in The Assassins you must face down Sterner Regnix and his guards, Moonbase assault challenges you to destroy the OmniCorp database, and Rescue From the Mines eschews violence in favour of a rescue mission. These are viewed from above and progress in turns. Laser Squad also features a 2-player &amp;quot;hotseat&amp;quot;-type gaming option.</resource>

On the planet Bacula, the Galden Tribe has overthrown the government and seized power over the whole world. Now they want more ? by invading the peaceful planet of Mu and kidnapped Queen Sheets.

The Mu-ans decided to take action. They asked their best scientists to come up with a weapon that will defeat the Galdens. After many long months, they were able to develop a vehicle of immense firepower, capable of leaping into the air to avoid ground hazards. In addition to that, it can transform into an airborne vessel whose purpose is to eliminate any kind of enemy in the sky.

Players have to guide their vehicle through six difficult levels - alternating between ground vehicle and fighter plane ? while destroying every Galden that gets in their way. While progressing, holes in the ground need to be avoided, as players lose one of their ships should they happen to fall through one. Shooting power pods scattered around the level allows the player to increase their firepower. However, they lose that firepower if one of their ships is destroyed.</resource>

Each level depicts a different locale and is divided into several screens. The game is presented in an isometric view and the ninja can move in eight different directions and jump.

Enemies, armed with fists and various ninja weapons, wander around the levels. The ninja must fight them either bare-handed or with the weaponry he finds along the way; in either case, he has a number of blows and attacks at his disposal, as well as the ability to block. There is a special weapon, shuriken, which are thrown in a straight line rather than used for melee combat; if they strike an enemy, they will instantly kill or at least severely damage them.

Various items scattered around the levels, such as keys, a rope and a map; collecting these items and using them in a proper place is necessary for completing the game. There are also hamburgers that award an extra life when eaten.

The game continues from the aftermath of the events of The Last Ninja. With the Koga scrolls now in his possession, Armakuni has begun training a new order of shadow warriors. During a training session, he is mysteriously transported to 20th-century New York City. Torn from his own time, Armakuni must defeat the evil shogun Kunitoki once more.

The Last Ninja Remix re-release version has an added short intro sequence, minor graphic changes and a remixed soundtrack.</resource>

The game takes place in various locations around town, loaded as separate scenes. The camera is stationary, and you control only where you aim the crosshair of your gun, which is used to either select dialogue options, or shoot at characters in front of you.

The core of the game is the conversations with different characters, and how you handle them dictates your success or failure. Gunfights are relatively infrequent, depending on your dialogue choices. However, you always have the option to start shooting at any time.</resource>

The first level is a vertically scrolling version of Salamander. You have to avoid flames spouting from the wall and shoot the enemies coming down the screen. The second level is a version of Centipede. Shoot the enemies coming down the screen while shooting flying enemies avoiding hitting mushrooms. The third level is a side view version of Moon Cresta. Let your ship fall and steer it to a re-fuelling point. Pressing the fire button gives you boost as you fight gravity pulling you down. Try to land gently. The fourth level is a top down vertically scrolling game. You must steer your ship through a tunnel avoiding the walls. Holding the fire button speeds up your ship giving you a bigger score. Repeat these levels eight times to complete the game.</resource>

By overtaking other racers (which partially have a bit of an unconventional driving style, which does not make it easier) without causing a crash, points are added to your account (1000 points per 10 cars). If you reach more than 20.000 points before the time has run out, you receive further time units and you can go on driving. Next to the normal track you need to master driving on ice, in curves, at night and on motorways. If you crash you need to drive into the mobile garage (PIT), which is at the left roadside, which costs you valuable seconds. Additionally the number of cars overtaken until now is set to zero.</resource>

Hold down the fire button to set the pace, then press it for hook and slice if needed. Greens are sloped, so be sure to factor this in. Four 18-hole courses are provided, and a 4-round match can consist of any combination of these, with up to 4 players joining in. 

There are three skill levels - novice players just have to hit the ball at the right speed in the right direction with the right club. Amateurs must be precise with the snap, to set the desired level of hook or slice - conventional wisdom in golf is to work on eliminating it first, then adding it back in - while the professional level also adds wind fluctuations.</resource>

The control of your golfer is the same but this edition has a few graphical and gameplay changes. Bunkers and trees have been added and there is a choice of two courses which you can play with three other friends supporting from 18 to 72 holes of golf. Like the previous releases you have three skill levels, novice (club selection and power of shot), amateur (ability to hook or snap shot) or professional (wind affecting shots). Before your shot you can adjust where you want to hit the ball and you can select which club to use. To hit the ball you hold down the fire button and when the desired power is reached on the power bar you let go. When playing amateur or professional, you have to press the button again when the moving power bar moves into the middle of the snap bar to hit the ball straight. To putt you have to hold the fire button on a power bar and let go when you have reached the desired amount of power.</resource>

The Galactic Museum mysteriously appears to the player after collecting these items. The player learns that by taking these items, he has become the next in a line of adventurers attempting to destroy the Wizard's Compendium, the leather scroll the player picked up. The museum has various display cases that require the insertion of special coins of various types to access. Some coins can be bought in random encounters with NPCs, some can be found as loot after combat and some coins can only be found at the bottom level of various dungeons meaning the player cannot proceed beyond a certain point until that dungeon is finished. Unlike many RPGs, the game does not use an experience point system. The player gains levels only through the successful completion of various quests. The game is mostly in top-down style for the world maps, towns and castles, but switches to a 3D style in the dungeons and in the museum. Several different areas of the game, like games in towns and certain museum displays, allow the character to play in special mini-games, which, if done successfully, will permanently increase attributes. Also, various casinos about the towns let players gamble to win money. It is also possible to rob banks in cities, but this attracts the attention of the town guards who will remember the robbery until the player enters another town.</resource>

These creatures simply walk blindly through the world in the hope of reaching safety at the end of the level - unfortunately these levels include steep drops, gaps in the ground, barriers and rivers amongst other hazards.

You are in control not of any individual Lemming, but of a cross-hair, which can be moved over any of the Lemmings. Along the bottom are a selection of functions which can be assigned to a Lemming, including climbing, floating and bashing. You must click to select the appropriate function, then click on the Lemming to activate it. Each level has a different range of skills on offer, a different amount of Lemmings, and a different percentage target in order to progress.</resource>

Use your joystick to lead Leonardo through 50 different levels including banks, museums, and warehouses. Pressing the fire button of your joystick you can push everything in your way, except walls. Pushed objects won't stop until colliding with other objects or the police officer and his ghost deputy whom are trying to stop your robberies. Every level has a time limit in which you must bring three equal items into one line to complete the level. Each level is larger than the screen, in the lower half of the screen you have a helpful radar for orientation. Running out of time or being caught by the police-men will cost you one of your five lives. If you are able to master the first ten levels you will receive a password, which you can use to start your next game directly on this level.</resource>

So the player mans a space ship, flies around the three levels (with the ability to turn around and change the flying height) and shoots everything he see. Besides flying enemies there are also defense stations on the ground to be dealt with. But while rocket ammo is unlimited, fuel has to be regularly refilled by landing besides a fuel pod. Three smart bombs which destroy everything on the screen help in tight situations. Every level runs on a time limit.</resource>

As he grew so did his appetite, and soon he began devouring galaxies, planets, and stars by the hundreds. Now your planet has appeared in Zelos' path, and it is up to you and a partner to fly into battle to save your world. Life Force is an action-packed shooter where there are six levels which alternate between side and vertical scrolling, each of them ending with a powerful guardian. Throughout the game, destroying certain enemies will release power ups which can be used to equip your ship with more powerful weapons, extra speed, and shields. Gameplay is for one player or two players simultaneously.</resource>

Build bridges they can walk on and walls to help guide them. Use ladders to send them up and down, springs to bounce them all around. And make sure they pick up the missing tiles along the way.

Luckily, you have your own special helper - Billie the Bird - to carry walls and bridges to just the places you need them. If you plan carefully, Buddy and Betty will reach the bottom floor and you'll hear a special song!

Every game in LINKING LOGIC holds new discoveries. And there's always more than one way to build a path, because Fisher-Price knows that children need lots of room to exercise their imaginations.

Learning Value: Young children are just beginning to learn how to think logically and plan a series of actions. LINKING LOGIC helps them develop these skills in an enjoyable game format. It also aids pattern recognition by asking children to match up different shapes. Ages 4-8</resource>

When you load the game for the first time and personalise it with your name you'll see a house with several rooms like a kitchen, living room, bed room, etc. After some time of waiting a little person will appear and check out the house with all its rooms to see if he likes it. If he likes it, he will move in shortly and bring his dog along with him. That's where the real &amp;quot;game&amp;quot; starts and thats what it will be like every time you'll load the game from then. You see the house and the little person living in it, doing all kinds of stuff people do in their daily routine. He'll cook, eat, feed his dog, read newspapers, watch TV and from time to time he will write you a letter to let you know what he feels or what things he misses. To keep it more gamelike, you can &amp;quot;talk&amp;quot; to him in form of typing commands like &amp;quot;feed dog&amp;quot;. You can also play cards with him and send him food or a present.
There is no aim in this game other than to interact with your LCP.</resource>

This entails progressing through 150 screens of platforms, ladders and ropes.

The Empire has sent robotic guards down to protect the gold, and contact with any of these will cost you a life. Your method of escaping them is to press fire to dig a hole in their line of movement, thus causing them to fall in briefly, allowing you to move across the gap safely. Once all the gold has been collected, a ladder allowing you to move onto the next screen is added. Completing these screens often requires forward planning and precision.

This was one of the earliest games to include a level editor, allowing the creation of new level designs with no programming skill.</resource>

The setting is pure fantasy ? the Old World is wrecked by magical discharges, and the wizards who attempted to keep it balanced ultimately gave up, and used their skill to create a new world. These Lords of Chaos (up to four, played either by human or computer) may now battle for control of this world. The idea of the game is to escape the level within a certain number of moves (preferably carrying lot of treasure and having killed the evil wizard Torquemada). Along the way you can use wizardry weapons and spells (there are 45 in total, created by combining ingredients) to conjure up mystical creatures like dragons and unicorns, but unfortunately so can Torquemada. Worlds include marshlands, castles and forests.</resource>

    <resource id="d89481f5a1d47ba51b1687a07a51ec8fad20f2dd" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Lords of Conquest is a strategy game by Electronic Arts from 1986, which was first written for the Apple II and then ported to the C64. It is based on the board game &amp;quot;Borderlands&amp;quot; by the English game manufacturer Eon and is designed for either up to four players or a single player against a computer opponent. The one who makes it to build or conquer three towns and keep them at least for one game round is the winner. If several players start to gain control over their third town in the same round, the game will continue until one of them loses a town or builds a fourth town. There is the alternative that you completely eliminate your competitors, but from experience both human players and computer opponent (!) throw in the sponge before it comes to that. To be able to build and defend the required three towns or, if necessary, to capture the hostile towns, the players need resources (iron, coal, wood, gold and horses), which they can gain from the correspondingly marked provinces of the map and which need to be protected from the graps of the other players. While the game against a single opponent is limited to pure tactics with military units, a game with three or four players has an additional trading phase, in which resources can be swapped / begged / blackmailed. Additionally, the players can side with the attacker or the defender during an attack. With this Lords of Conquest also allows many diplomatic interaction by founding and breaking (short-lived) allies and at the end everyone screams in confusion and goes for each other's throats... the way it should be! The game comprises twenty ready-made maps (Northamerica, China, Mediterranean area, world etc.) as well as the possibility to get new maps generated or create own maps in the editor.</resource>

The game features a total of 32 fictitious racetracks from around the world, split into 3 difficulty levels. There are 19 computer opponents (15 on the 8-bit versions) and you have to finish in the top 10 (top 8 on the 8-bits) to progress. The higher you finish in one race, the lower down the grid you start for the next race. The opposition drivers have pun names based on the F1 drivers of the day - examples include Ricardo Pastry and Crashhard Banger.

You can choose between sound effects or one of a variety of music pieces. The game features a simultaneous 2-player mode, but the 1-player mode only uses half the screen, a simple animation filling the other half. In most races you will have to make a pitstop for fuel in order to reach the finish. The tracks include features such as oil slicks, roadworks, boulders and rivers - contact with these (or the other cars) will slow you, but there is no car damage model.</resource>

Players choose the race of their colonist, which has advantages and disadvantages that can be paired to their respective strategies. To win, players not only compete against each other to amass the largest amount of wealth, but must also cooperate for the survival of the colony.

Central to the game is the acquisition and use of Multiple Use Labor Elements, or M.U.L.E.s, to develop and harvest resources from the player's real estate. Depending on how it is outfitted, a M.U.L.E. can be configured to harvest Energy, Food, Smithore (from which M.U.L.E.s are constructed), and Crystite (a valuable mineral available only at the &amp;quot;Tournament&amp;quot; level). Players must balance supply and demand of these elements, buying what they need and selling what they don't. Players may exploit or create shortages by refusing to sell to other players or to the &amp;quot;store,&amp;quot; which raises the price of the resource on the following turns. Scheming between players is encouraged by allowing collusion, which initiates a mode allowing a private transaction.</resource>

You are armed with different kinds of weapons including downward bombs, air-to-air missiles and a nuclear bomb. More of each of these can be picked up by collecting the parachutes which are dropped into your path. There are mountain ranges, deserts and arctic scenes to clear along the way, with big boss planes to face.</resource>

Unusually, the default table has multiple flippers at the bottom of the table, as well as some located higher up. Use them to return a ball higher on table and to prevent it being lost at the bottom of the table. Hitting some valuable areas of table gives you a bonus.

The goal of each levels is to reach the exit within the time limit. The catch is, that the exit needs to be activated by lighting all torches that are spread throughout a level. Naturally, there are lots of different obstacles and enemies trying to stop the player. Most enemies follow a set path, however some may chase the player's sprite through the entire stage. As the levels become more complex, it is necessary to work out routes that don't end in a dead end and allow the player to reach the exit in time while still avoiding enemies.</resource>

However before the being conquered, a group of scientists has managed to create one last weapon and hidden it underground. The name of the weapon is Mag Max and only it might be able to defeat the alien invaders. Mag Max however is incomplete and for security reasons, his component parts are scattered across the land. Through their collection, Mag Max's strength increases.

Mag Max is a side-scrolling shooter game. At the beginning, Mag Max is only a tiny little fighter craft that can fire low-powered projectiles. As component pieces are found; such as a head, legs and a laser lance, Mag Max's offensive power increases. Access to the underworld can be granted through small dark craters on the landscape. Once in the underworld, Mag Max's weapons vary slightly as do the enemies (there are no stationary objects underground). Enemy fire or contact on each of the components will destroy that component. Fire on the main fighter will destroy Mag Max. At the end of each level awaits a boss creature.</resource>

On screen you get a full-court, horizontally-scrolling gameplay. A referee monitors the action and calls the fouls if the gameplay gets too rough, and a crowd cheers you on. Your team starts each game at a certain salary level. Your goal is to beat the opposition to earn a larger salary. Keep winning and you might etch your name onto the Big Earners Screen. Choose from five skill levels - Rookie to Professional. Each level provides quicker gameplay, tougher defense, and bigger bucks if you win. Each game lasts four three-minute, real-life quarters. In between quarters, you can review stats such as field goal percentage, three-pointers made, rebounds, and steals. If the score is tied at the final buzzer, you play additional quarters until someone wins. You control one player at a time. An arrow appears on-screen above the head of the player you're running. Just hit B to switch players. You can play against the computer or up to three friends.</resource>

The player controls a snake called Lenni who has to eat all fruits which are divided over the scrolling level. Said levels are constructed like mazes, i.e. many small gangways. Every time a fruit is eaten, the length of Lenni grows. The player needs to control Lenni (he moves and turns automatically when meeting a wall; the player only needs to intervene when another turn is in order) in a way so he does get in his own way. Each level has to be completed within 60 seconds, but collecting clocks extends this limit. Other power-ups are rabbits (make Lenni faster) , snails (make Lenni slower, but no slower than the default speed), axes (the length of Lenni gets cut back to the starting value) and teleports to the starting point of the level. Each power-up also effects the points.</resource>

The player or players create a variety of monsters, bestow them with different traits and equip them with modern and/or futuristic weapons to do battle. Monsters can be further customised through buying special abilities, such as adding tentacles to use advanced weaponry.

Two players can fight against each other, play capture the flag, or compete for a high score against a computer-controlled horde. In single-player mode, the computer controls an opponent to fight.

Battles take place on various different maps that can have tactically significant effects, such as mountains for agile monsters to hide behind during combat. Monsters can be stored on diskette and can be upgraded by victories against other monsters or computer opponents.</resource>

A Mandroid agent is sent down on the planet to gather information concerning Auker's whereabouts and find the files. The agent can navigate the planet on foot, but to help him accomplish his task faster, he can use a remote vehicle. It can withstand most enemy fire, but it gets destroyed if it makes contact with any of the industrial waste rivers bordering the landscape. Energy is also used up, so the agent needs to stock up using depots scattered around the landscape. While navigating the landscape, the agent encounters many types of cyborgs along the way, both on the streets and inside buildings. The agent may decide whether to communicate with most of these cyborgs, or eliminate them with his weapons. Some of the cyborgs drop weapons when shot, and the agent may swap his default weapon for their better weapons. Most of them contain map information essential in accomplishing the mission, and the only way to get this is by threatening them. Money is necessary for success, and can be obtained by gambling or accessing credit dispensers found in the city.</resource>

More immediately, a girl named Sandy has gone missing from the local highschool and her boyfriend Dave swears that he saw Dr. Fred abducting her. Dave knows that he cannot do it alone and will need help from two other students if he has any hope of infiltrating the mansion and rescuing Sandy.</resource>

There is a 2-player mode in which players must race to the finish; otherwise you're racing against the clock.</resource>

Crabs, turtles and fighter flies must be cleared out by jumping underneath the platform they sit on, then kicking them away. Each level is cleared when a set number of coins is collected.

For the two player mode, the first to collect the set amount of coins wins.</resource>

You must clear three sectors for each planet in the Solar System before attempting to dock with the Factory Ship. The game is viewed from above your ship with the whole sector shown on screen. You can turn your ship left and right as well as thrust forward and you must shoot anything that moves on the screen. Once a sector is cleared you must enter a gate to move to the next one.

If you are touched by any object then you lose one of five lives but your ship does have a limited shield which is seen on a gauge and when it is empty then you lose this option for the rest of the game. Smart-bombs will destroy all on the screen but is limited as well but you can hyperspace to another part of the screen as many times as you like. Once three sectors have been cleared then you dock with the Factory Ship which sits at the top of the screen with a gap moving left or right. Get through the gap without touching the ship and you have docked and can move to the next planet.

Master Blaster is based on the arcade game Asteroids and you use the keyboard to control your ship.</resource>

In the game the MasterType is a powerful wizard who is helping the player defending his command ship by using his laser like force. The command ship is stationed in the center of the screen and from each corner of the screen missiles are launched toward the ship. In each corner of the screen there is a word and by successfully typing in these words the wizard uses his force to zap the missiles. The command ship has four areas and when an area has been hit by a missile it's shield will be destroyed. If the same area is hit a second time the whole ship will explode and the game will be over. 

The game consists of 17 or 18 lessons depending on version and is chosen before the game begins. The first lesson deals with the home row keys (a to ;) and the player only has to enter single letters. As the difficulty increases with each lesson longer and more complex phrases needs to be typed in. Once a lesson is completed the player gets a summary showing how well he has done and whether further practice is needed. Some options exist to alter the game after the player's needs. A beginner mode can be turned on and it's also possible to set a speed goal (number of words per minute). In addition to the lessons included, it is also possible for the player to create his own lessons.</resource>

Matches are seven-a-side, with variable lengths from 10 to 30 minutes. All kicks except set pieces are variable in strength using a Kick-o-meter which is displayed on screen. One revolutionary feature of the game was the Diamond Deflection System, which mathematically calculated the angle and pace of any rebounds.</resource>

It was licensed around the BBC's football highlights programme famed for its classic theme music. The standard options exist (such as training, transfers and tactics) but the control system is unique. A diary is presented on the table, and you have to drag the icons for the activities you want to focus that amount of time on. This not only makes the presentation and style unusual, but also accurately represents the limited amount of time a real manager has.</resource>

The game is played by two players (the second can be AI or another human) on a grid containing 36 boxes. Upon flipping a box an animated figure is revealed and the aim is to get pairs of the same kind and colour. The player will then get to keep uncovering boxes until a match isn't made. Beneath the grid is a word which is partially revealed as boxes are opened and after every match the player gets a chance to enter the word. The player that first enters the right word wins the game. There are some different variations of the game: one that lacks the word guessing part, one with reversed words and one where the word is scrambled.</resource>

The player is driving a formula racing car from a top down perspective and has to reach a goal in the shortest and fastest way. The road has a number of forks and over each branch there is a sign with a mathematical operation which changes the mileage when driving through. For example if the goal distance is 20 miles the player has to choose two +10 branches. The goal has to be reached exactly and if the mileage is larger than the goal the player will be rerouted and need to go through a branch that either subtracts or divides the mileage.</resource>

In this Centipede style game you play a retired captain of a starship, one of those who had won the previous war against aliens. You come out of retirement because the aliens are back, tougher than ever. Thus a second gridwar begins. You pilot your ship and shoot at chains of pods coming at you. As you hit the pods, they break into smaller independent chains. The aliens seem to have a sense of humor, though. Each pod in the chain coming at you looks like a...camel. Flying camels from outer space. As you start shooting the camels, you are attacked by guns from the bottom of the screen and from the left side of the screen. Even worse, a human traitor has joined the aliens, and when he appears on the screen, running across the grid on top, the guns get very accurate at shooting you. Luckily you can shoot traitors. Other twists include deflectors, which turn your bullets and even ricochet them back at you. The enemy fires back too. And as you advance in level, the enemy changes the direction of their attack. Not to be confused with Advance of the Megacamel which is also called Attack of the Mutant Camels in Europe.</resource>

When you die you enter a limbo room, in which one exit (randomly-selected by the game) restores Arabesque; the others result in death.

Every time you play, the bonus items are randomly placed, and the exact map layout is adjusted. There are over 1000 variations and ten skill levels. Much like today's FPS' there are vases to reload the gun and grant lives. They are reset at the beginning of each game hour.</resource>

Mayhem decides to change it back, with the help of Theo Saurus, the apprentice responsible for Monsterland being the gloomy place it is now. The game is a side-scrolling platform game, where you play the part of Mayhem. You can kill enemies by jumping on them. There are five levels in the game. Each one starts in unhappy mode, where Mayhem must collect enough bags of magic dust, from the enemies you face, then find your way to Theo's hidden cave. Theo then uses the dust to make the level happy again. This change is reflected in the more jazzy music, colourful landscape and even the monsters who look more friendly and cheerful.</resource>

You are armed, but so are the Outcasts you must face.

Hazards include walls, gaps in the road and oil slicks. A scanner at the bottom of the screen gives some advanced warning. You can pick up improved weaponry, extra fuel, and boxes of oil, which you can drop into the paths of onrushing bikes. As well as shooting other bikes, you can ram them into walls at the side of the road, or into the aforementioned hazards.</resource>

It turns out that he was one of eight scientists involved in Project Overlord, a mission to remotely control people. You soon learn of the deaths of other related figures. Suspects may include the British intelligence head, a surveillance company owner, and the professor's daughter.

Tex's first adventure (and the only one released for systems other than DOS or Windows PCs) takes you through the seedy West Coast world of 2033. The game is icon-driven, with object puzzles less significant than detective deduction and character interaction. 

Mean Streets features dozens of characters to interact with by asking questions or offering bribes. Fights often arise, but a diplomatic approach is more successful with characters whose guilt is unproven. Although it is largely an adventure game, travel between cities involves piloting your Lotus Speeder in a flight simulation section.</resource>

Should critical levels of nuclear activity be detected emanating from the surface of the satellites, the machine will activate and destroy both civilizations. 

Marauding invaders, from the Zagos Galaxy, unaware of the danger from the doomsday machine, launch a nuclear attack against Pholos. Xylos then launches a counter-offensive with hypnobeams against the Zags, slowing down the critical build-up of nuclear radiation. 

Your mission: As the saviour of the galaxy, you must locate the legendary Good Mediator to acquire the mythical Time Crystal, which endows the possessor with the power to psychokinetically dispatch any destructive elements to another time zone. Leave Xylos, and seek out the planet far, far below... but, be prepared at any time to be recalled to Xylos and Pholos to combat the Zags using your joystick controlled missiles.

All those millions of planets and moons and stars and comets swirling about in the vastness of space. Imagine what fun it would be to explore - to boldly go where no boldly goer had boldly gone before - unless they happened to live there. 

Latest research from the Institute of Advanced Research (I.A.R.) indicated that there are quite a lot of planets with things living on them. Some of these things are pretty intelligent like us really. Other of these things are really stupid, like whelks, for example. 

Anyway, to cut a long story short, you have been selected to explore the universe, boldly seeking out strange and exciting new worlds. If you find any, your instructions are quite clear.

Fisher-Price knows that children like to do &amp;quot;grown-up&amp;quot; work, and that's one reason why helping the window washer of MEMORY MANOR is so much fun.

It's a big job! Your child has to plan the water supply so it doesn't run out. That means remembering which windows to wash - the ones with cats, flowers, or birds in them. And avoiding the windows with frowning faces, because they use up too much water.

Sound easy? It is - until the rain comes and smudges all the windows. Then your child will have fun with the challenge of remembering which window is which.

Learning Value: Memory is a skill that can be improved by practice and concentration. MEMORY MANOR will exercise your child's memory, while it encourages careful planning. Ages 4-8</resource>

In a trademark element of the Mercenary series, there are several ways to achieve this end. A civil war between two factions, the Palyars (indigenous &amp;quot;good guys&amp;quot;) and the Mechanoids (invading &amp;quot;bad guys&amp;quot;), affords the player an opportunity to earn money to buy their escape from Targ. For instance, each faction seeks the destruction of installations belonging to its rival, and the capture of material or other resources to support their cause. There are other routes to escape, and it is possible to combine strategies to both leave Targ and keep the wealth accrued there.</resource>

Following the successes over Targ's Central City, the controller of the BENSON computer relaxes and enjoys himself. Soon however, he grows bored and starts looking around for new challenges on the still hazardous Planet Targ. Rumors about the Palyar Commander's brother-in-law living in the southern hemisphere suggest that this may be a good challenge. In this Second City, the battle between Palyars and Mechanoids still rages... and nothing is as it seems.</resource>

Finding strategic placings is important, especially as you can't shoot while on water. Most of the time you are on foot, but at times you can hijack vehicles of shot foes. There are improved weapons, smart bombs and energy recharges to collect. Each of the 8 levels ends with a large vehicle requiring multiple shots to destroy.</resource>

Unfortunately he is not very enthusiastic, flees into the water and jams himself under a ship. Myrtle's first priority is to save Gordon.

The player navigates Myrtle through an underwater labyrinth (although there a few screens above ground) and collects items. Those items have to be used in another location to proceed. It is also important to avoid enemies because touching them reduces her life energy, which can be refilled by finding beer bottles. There is no scrolling and Gordon's air supply acts as time limit.</resource>

You have to start at the bottom, initially busting the casual dealers before reaching their suppliers, and ultimately the casino-dwelling honchos. 

This is done through a combination of driving and shooting, through an overhead rendition of Miami. When crooks are stopped they will often provide valuable information, although sometimes they can only be stopped by shooting them. 

When you learn of a meeting, you can enter it on foot, either to gain evidence or make an arrest - but remember that a joint full of crooks will not simply allow you to do your civic duty. This is all done against a time limit, with a one-minute penalty for crashing the car.</resource>

On one side, the spectacular dunks of Michael Jordan of the Chicago Bulls; on the other, Larry Bird's incredible accuracy from the outside. 

While Bird feels right home at the three-point contest, where five racks with five balls each are placed around the three-point arc and the player must pick each ball and throw in the the best timing possible to get as many points as possible during the 60 second window, only Jordan has the air-time to perform on the slam dunk contest, where the player has a number of dunks at his disposal, each requiring different timing to get the best score from all three attempts from the judges, and win the competition.

While they are two completely different players, they can still go one-on-one on a half-court match, played to points or with a time duration. Can Bird's stealing and outside shooting ability be a match to Jordan's speed and jumping abilities?</resource>

The game starts on a sequence of stairways, up which Mickey must move, shooting any creatures that get in his way. Eventually you will come to a door and go through it, at which point the second section of the game begins.

These are viewed from above, and see Mickey negotiate his way through a multi-screen maze, with multiple exits on each screen. Ghosts and ogres block his path, but he's armed with a water pistol for the former and an axe for the latter, both of which need replenishing regularly. Some doors require keys to move through.</resource>

A wide range of strategies are available. You can bring the stand-in players in, and instruct players as to how aggressively to play when opportunities arise, with 7 distinct batting strategies. When fielding you have options on field placement and bowling style - use the fastball and curveball wisely. Players will sometimes pick up injuries (the correct level of warming up can reduce this risk), or argue with the umpire over controversial decisions.</resource>

The plot focuses on six adventurers in a quest to discover the secret of the &amp;quot;Inner Sanctum,&amp;quot; though little information is offered upfront about this quest or its object. The ultimate quest is kept intentionally vague, and left for players to gradually piece together as they explore the world. Although it appears to take place in a straightforward medieval fantasy setting of knights in armor, mythical monsters and magicians, a number of science fiction elements are revealed later in the game,</resource>

The Gates to Another World eventually takes all of them to another world, known as CRON. There, a great turmoil is caused by Sheltem's actions, and the heroes must stop his madness, preventing him from casting the planet into its own sun.

Gates to Another World is the second installment in the Might and Magic series, and a sequel to Secret of the Inner Sanctum. Core gameplay is similar to predecessor, with the player creating a party of six characters and exploring vast first-person 3D environments, while fighting enemies in turn-based combat and leveling up. Unlike the first game, enemy encounters occur at set points rather than spawning randomly, though enemy type selection is still random.</resource>

You can play against the computer or another human; either way, select a specialist subject and 2 team-mate graphics (all representing white people). The overall style and presentation are very similar to Elite's earlier A Question of Sport license.

In the first round you select one of twelve random questions from the Jukebox, each of which has four options. A correct answer earns you two points, while an incorrect answer gives your opponent the chance to steal for one point. In round 2 you get three clues to name a star - you get three points for guessing from one clue, two points from two, and one point if you need all 3. In round three, choose an Easy question (from your category) for one point, or a Hard one (from someone else's) for two.

Round four asks you to Guess The Year that a set of events happened in, with scoring the same as round 2. Then comes the quickfire round - answer up to nine questions in 45 seconds, with a 2-second penalty for an incorrect answer. Finally, the six remaining Jukebox pictures are revealed and answered.</resource>

    <resource id="4525a827ab08fdbb999ed2f2089aaef0db937c25" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Mind Control is a single screen game split into two parts where your mission is to destroy Zyco, an indestructible alien who is ruling Earth and enslaving all humans. Scientists realising that Zyco can't be destroyed, have worked out that his only weak spot would be the massive sensory neurone in his brain and so have selected you to be shrunk to enter his bloodstream to move around his brain before destroying the neurone with a laser. The first part of the game is a platformer where you must get from the bottom right of the screen and climb stairs at each end of the three levels that make up the screen to get to Zyco's brain. Trying to stop you are people and these have to be jumped or if you touch them, then you lose one of three lives. At the top of the screen is a Miniaturising Room where you are shrunk before you enter the brain.

The second part of the game has you viewing the brain from the side and you have to make your way from the bottom of the screen to the centre of the brain following a path. As you move around the brain there are white blood corpuscles and anti-bodies following a set path and these must be avoided or you increase in size and a life is lost. The walls that make up the path also make you grow if touched so these have to be avoided as well. Once you reach the center and destroy the neurone you then keep attempting to move around the brain over various levels where the enemies get faster.

The ACE release doesn't have the first platform part of the game, just the moving around the brain part.</resource>

You are presented with up to 24 coloured and spotted (like dice) blocks, arranged in columns of up to 4. The task is to arrange these so that they are lined up in columns matching their number.

You are in control of a crosshair, which can be moved to cover four blocks. Holding fire while pushing left or right and hovering it over a group of 4 will move the four blocks around in sequence. Things can get harder when the level arrangement results in blocks having to be moved through sections with a column of only 2, or when some parts of the arena lack cogs, meaning that you can't move on those sections. Later in the game you'll have to work on multiple floors at the same time, switching blocks between them.</resource>

The enemy are sending I.G.L. Missiles which move from the top of the screen downwards, leaving behind a trail and you must stop them hitting the cities. You fire a limited amount of missiles one at a time and you control a cross-hair to show where the missile should explode. Once the missile explodes it creates a fireball which expands and if a missile hits the fireball it is destroyed. If a city is hit by the enemies missiles then it is destroyed and stays destroyed for the rest of the game. Once all missiles have been destroyed or hit the ground you receive bonus points for any remaining cities and missiles and if any cities left you move to the next level. Planes and satellites occasionally appear on the screen and these can be destroyed for bonus points.</resource>

Reaching the room itself is no easy task, as the hotel is split into segments of 8 floors, and you can’t move onto the next one without the emergency key, which the porter has hold of – he must be located. Each of these has one eighth of the secret stop code, and these must be entered in order to finally diffuse the bomb. Secrets can be gleaned from the opposing hijackers, and from the barman. In some cases furniture can be used to your advantage. 
The whole game is similar to Impossible Mission, requiring lots of logic, puzzle-solving and structured thought.</resource>

There are six of them, and at the end of each you'll rescue a baby bubble that's – yup – been kidnapped (there really was a lot of this in '80s games, eh? Chilling– Ed). Before you can reach each bubble you have to collect individual pieces of a map that are thrown across every stage, forcing you to explore every corner of the code. Each level has its own theme with baddies to match: there's a spooky one, an arctic one, and you really have to check out level two even if it's just by watching our video. It's very clearly a love letter to Gremlin's Bounder. Great stuff!</resource>

The winner emerges when all their competitors lose all their money and become bankrupt.

The screen has four rows of platforms containing four gravestones on three of the levels and part of the platforms can be turned 90°. The partying monsters appear from the top and left of the screen and move to the right of the screen along the platforms. Turning the platforms makes the monsters move downwards when they hit the turned parts and head to the bottom of the screen. Pressing the fire button makes the gravestones move up and down and when a monster hits a gravestone then they are captured. If the monster hits the other side of the screen then they have escaped and let too many escape, shown by a gauge, then it is game over. Once a certain amount of monsters have been captured then you move to the next level. Before you start the game you can select the level number from one to nine.</resource>

Like the original, the game is a flick-screen platformer with puzzly leanings. Learning the movement paths of enemies, and the timing sequence of the crushers, and working out a path across the screen by using the offered ropes and platforms. Not all parts of all screens can be accessed at once.

You will need to collect money and other items along the way. Before starting the game, you must choose five items from a selection of 21 to form your 'Freedom Kit' – correct selections are essential to complete the game, and a degree of trial and error is required to know which ones are correct.</resource>

    <resource id="7812fc885466c2af6f53b7fbe8f8350d027e1fb4" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Moondust's gameplay is characterized by graphical complexity, and the game features an abstract ambient score. The goal of the game is to cover the bullseye at the center of the screen with &amp;quot;moonjuice.&amp;quot; To do this, the player controls spaceman Jose Scriabin (named in honor of synaesthetic composer Alexander Scriabin) as he drops a seed square and then moves around the screen in arcing paths to run over the seed, smearing it to cover the bullseye. As Jose travels, flight patterns of he and the bullet-shaped spaceships he must avoid are created and as they pass through the trails that are created, and as the moonjuice spreads and smears, the musical score is modified according to a generative algorithm. In-game scoring system assigns point-values according to an algorithm when the level is completed. Players start with three seeds but may acquire more if they have scored highly enough.

The game features 4 modes: Beginner, Evasive, Freestyle, and Spinsanity. In Beginner mode, the seeds that Jose must smear remain in one position wherever they had been dropped. In Evasive mode, however, the seeds seek to evade Jose by rushing to the edge of the screen. Freestyle mode greatly increases the player's control over Jose, removing the physical element of momentum to connect Jose's motions directly to the joystick controller's. In Spinsanity mode, the spaceships travel in a spiral pattern making smearing of the seed more difficult for the player.</resource>

In Moonmist, you are a famous young American detective. An old friend, Tamara Lynd, has written you a letter (included in the package), asking for your help. And so you have travelled to England to test your detective skills.

As the story begins, you are outside Tresyllian Castle - the old, dark, hauntingly beautiful castle where Tamara now lives. Tamara greets you, and you meet some interesting guests. But your visit soon turns to mystery, as a trail of riddles and clues leads you to a hidden valuable treasure.

But Tamara is worried about a ghost that is tormenting her. What does the ghost want? Is it jealous of her? Does the ghost want the hidden treasure for itself? Or is the ghost a fake - just someone dressing up to frighten Tamara? If so, why?

Some of the characters in the game will treat you differently whether you play as a male or female character, and the game comes with four different variations (choosen at the start by picking a color).

You begin your mission in space where you must avoid deadly aurora flares, photon torches and space bullets from the sun in this quadrant. From time to time you will see a moon pass by, and by flying near it you can descend to the surface. As you sweep along the surface, you will see stranded miners which need to be rescued by flying over them. Also on the moons surface are various obstacles which must be avoided or destroyed, such as towers and lunar satellites as well as alien surface destroyers. Should you survive and rescue six miners (the maximum your ship can carry), then you may take off from the surface by using the accelerator rings. There are several different types of moons found in this quadrant, each with a different level of difficulty. To help out, your ship is equipped with photon torpedoes and shields (though you will lose points while using the shield).</resource>

Even sell or scrap the ones that you don't need.
The game is viewed from above your large ship. After deploying from your base you can move about freely in any direction. On the screen you can see your score and a small radar which shows the position of the Orbitals and Nucleus. The further into the game you go and buy more hulls and weapons you will end up with a ship that nearly fills the screen.</resource>

Starting at a gas station you are able to control your speed up to 80mph, brake and move left or right as you avoid other drivers and various obstacles. There are three types of roads to drive on and they are motorway, b-road and dirt and you must avoid hitting the sides and drivers or you lose one of five lives. On the side of the playing area are various dials and these are speedometer, fuel which decreases as you drive, and generator which shows your battery power and decreases if you don't drive full speed. You can also see your mileage driven, lives and if you have your spare tyre. Obstacles you encounter affect different aspects of your car and these are potholes which cause your steering to be erratic, road patches which slow you down, avalanches which means hitting a boulder loses you a life, and you will also encounter crossroads with vehicles moving across the screen which need avoiding. Broken glass means you will stop and your tyre will have to be changed with only one spare tyre, and logs will damage your radiator causing your car to overheat. Gas Stations appear occasionally and here you can refuel, fix your radiator and increase your battery power.</resource>

Once you have the flame spirit, you need to find the entrance to the temple the crown is in. Offer the flame spirit to the skull spirit guarding the entrance, and you can get in and take the crown. Once you have the crown, you need to make it to the top of the mine before time runs out. To make this task more challenging, numerous cave bats fly around which can steal the crown. If this happens, you need to begin again! At the very bottom of the mine is a deadly spider; if you're not careful while exploring this region of the mine, you could become caught in it's web and be eaten. Each level has a time limit, and the more levels you complete the shorter the time limit becomes!</resource>

The screen automatically scrolls from right to left which means he has to keep moving until the front of the train is reached. Then he swings onto a handcart to get to the next level. There are many obstacles on the way, examples being jumps between wagons, gas leaks or dark tunnels. Collected gas masks and torches help to survive the two latter. However, most of the time Mick has to deal with the bandits themselves. Those try to kill him, but this can be avoided by dodging the bullets, shooting back or jumping on their heads. Also both parties have grenades to their disposal.</resource>

Secondly, Mr. Do is armed with a power ball. This can be thrown to destroy an enemy.

You control Mr. Do! the clown who has a hammer which can be used to knock out the blocks in the floor. Wandering throughout the castle are deadly unicorns which are constantly trying to catch you. Your goal is to earn as many points as possible and to progress through the increasingly difficult castles. 

There are two ways to complete a castle; you can either destroy all of the deadly unicorns by crushing them with blocks, or you can knock out all of the blocks which have a cherry symbol on them. In addition to the cherry blocks, there are three blocks with a key. If all three key blocks are knocked out, the door on the roof of the castle unlocks. If you make it to the door, all of the unicorns will temporarily become harmless and will contain a letter. If you hit a letter unicorn, you will earn a letter in the word EXTRA. Spell the complete word, and you will earn an extra life. 

The last type of block you'll encounter has a skull on it. If you knock out two skull blocks, all of the blocks between them will also be knocked out and replaced with a bridge. As the castles progress, the castle layout will become trickier and the unicorns become faster and more numerous.</resource>

This sequel continued on the &amp;quot;eat the dots/avoid the ghosts&amp;quot; gameplay of the original game, but added new features to keep the title fresh.

Like her boyfriend, Ms. Pac-Man attempts to clear four various and challenging mazes filled with dots and ever-moving bouncing fruit  while avoiding Inky, Blinky, Pinky and Sue, each with their own personalities and tactics.  One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Ms. Pac-Man.

Ms. Pac-Man can turn the tables on her pursuers by eating one of the four Energizers located within the maze. During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Ms. Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points (ranging from 200, 400, 800 and 1600, progressively). The Energizer power only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghost's eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Ms. Pac-Man again.

Player controls a large and angry pre-historic monster who
is out to destroy Japan. Why should a normally peace-loving
creature wish to inflict such havoc? Well, it seems that some
Japanese explorers have unearthed and stolen some eggs and have
brought them back to Japan. For centuries they, like everyone else,
have thought your species to be long extinct - they are WRONG!

As the game begins you arrive at the coast of Japan in search of the
lost eggs which have been scattered around the cities of this island
country. Naturally, the armed forces are out in force and your must
battle your way through the cities and army bases carrying out your
plan of &amp;quot;Urban re-development&amp;quot;.

In the course of your Journey, you will come across your lost eggs.
Once they have found, you should search for a nuclear waste dump.
Not only are these nuclear waste sites very tasty and invigorating
but they are also very good sites for hatching monster eggs. Using
these sites you are able to create more monsters to carry on should
you fail.

As Japan is such a small place, and with all this monster activity
in the surrounding sea, it is not surprising that you will occasionally
encounter other monsters during your exploits. Like your monster, they
tend to have a rather intense need to express their deeper emotions by
means of violence and destruction! If you must defeat all three enemy
monsters.

Finally, you (or one of your descendants) will reach the harbour and
will sail off into the sunset (well, almost) and, like the endless
cycles of life, it will all begin anew.

He's just taking a stroll around the upper deck of the ship when he discovers an open cabin door. Behind it: a dead man. As it turns out, the body of Raleigh Cartwright III. Sir Charles has three days to find the murderer, because then, the ship will reach New Orleans, giving the culprit a safe chance to escape. The joystick controls the player's sprite to move into the respective direction, and pressing the button opens a menu with appropriate commands for the current situation. Walk around, Inspect an item, or examine evidence. You will meet some characters who also happen to be suspects. Use these encounters as a fact-finding session. Take notes on what he or she has said. Share these notes with other passengers and crew members. But your first job is to find the body. Until you do, any information you gather will be of little value. Once you find the body, the other passengers will prove to be much more talkative. Collect as many notes and evidence as you can to solve the mystery. Once you think that you have it solved, make an accusation by going to the character that you want to accuse and by using the joystick, point to Talk to [character's name], and press the joystick button. Then point to Accuse [character's name] and press the joystick button. Depending on the amount of evidence collected, you will know if your hunch was right or wrong. Murder on the Mississippi has four possible endings with many variations on each one. Don't let the Delta Princess arrive to New Orleans before you solve the mystery, or the murderer will get away.</resource>

Neither has opposition to potential exploitation or environmental damage; your resistance movement has discovered that Macro-Genetic Mutoids (Mutants) are being bred purely to be used as weapons. 

Controlling the familiarly-named Rainbow Warrior in this top-view shooter, you must fly to each of the 15 mutant-breeding zones, collecting their self-destruct pods, and taking all of these to the control room. You are armed with missiles, torpedos and a shield, and can use one of these at a time. The control zone is hazardous, and any contact is destructive, but reaching its target will recharge your three lives; thus, it can be worth doing this before you have completed all 15 zones.

The gameplay element of having short levels with a single specific target to account for resembles Hunter's Moon.</resource>

Players interview witnesses, gather evidence, and sift through lab reports to get the clues they need to solve each case. Each action, particularly traveling between locations, adds time to the game clock.

One to four people can play, competing to see who solves the mystery first and in the optimum amount of time. After the case is presented, players take turns choosing an option, getting a clue number, and then looking it up in the manual. Once a player thinks they have it solved, they present their solution to the others. Then he looks up the complete solution. If it's 100% right, he wins and the players start on a new case. If any detail is wrong, he's out of the game and the others continue toward a solution.</resource>

Each level is based around related myths and legends. The gameplay consists of running and jumping through each level, collecting objects and weapons, fighting enemies and solving puzzles. Enemies include skeletons, demons, wraiths, mummies and vikings. Weapons include a sword, gun and fireballs. Each level contains a mythical boss enemy, such as Medusa, Thor and a Hydra. Puzzles involve using the right object in the right location to progress, such as throwing skulls into a pit of fire to summon a monster, and using the right weapon against enemies, such as attacking a specific monster with tridents. The user manual gave some background information about the various myths referred to in the game and gave hints to the puzzles. C64GS CART - At black screen, type SYS 3 MYTH with the spaces in uppercase. This will begin the game!</resource>

Due to the damaged caused by the storm, the EPIC was forced to land on an uninhabited planet to make urgent repairs. While on the planet, the ship's crew had no idea that an unknown virus made its way onto the ship. Upon returning to the EPIC's home base of Altontron, the crew became aware that the ship had been infected by the alien life form.

They have sent an android called NEIL to get rid of the aliens. Each room of the ship contains nine green aliens that NEIL needs to destroy. As well as these aliens, there are also robots that come in the room from time to time. When shot, these robots leave behind cells, which give NEIL extra ammunition, allow him to replenish his air supply, or use a smart bomb which kills all aliens in the room. Finding a turbo lift allows NEIL to travel between floors.</resource>

In N.O.M.A.D., players take control of the Mobile Attack Droid 471 as it ventures through the city, in this top-view shooter. Players begin with four lives. The Droid moves with considerable inertia (although some rooms disable this), and control involves using left and right to rotate it, pushing forward to provide thrust in the direction it is facing, and pushing backwards to reverse. 

The early part of the route is linear, but later on there are junctions to plan around. Moving enemies, spawning points and wall-mounted guns are the main threats. There are many switches along the walls, which open the sealed doors located throughout the levels, although a switch doesn't automatically operate on the nearest door. The game features regular checkpoints, which will restore the droid to that point after the lose a life. Points are awarded constantly for survival, and for shooting the enemies and other targets.</resource>

    <resource id="1d05b500cb2472898f34721cbc1ae7c678c8ea73" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Narc is a 1-2 player game, where your mission is to infiltrate the Mr. Big Corporation, the scourge of the underworld. To do this, you must get through the game's eight stages, with over ten sectors like the junkyard, subway, drug lab, nursery, downtown, Sunset Strip, and even the corporation, where Mr. Big resides. In order to get through the stages, you are required to collect a number of safe cards, and insert them in the slot next to the stage exit.  Each sector includes a map, and should be easy to read. For example, the blue or red dots represent you, and the white dots are the missile launchers, while the &amp;quot;E&amp;quot; indicates the exit.

Your mission ain't going to be easy, as you will come face-to-face with enemies including the canine mutts, Das Lof Gang, Dr. Spike Rush, Joe Rockhead, Kinky Pinky, Sgt. Skyhigh, HQ Posse, and Mr. Big himself. You have two ways you can deal with them: either put a bullet in them or make arrests. Furthermore, they will try to blow you up the minute they see you. Fortunately, you're armed with a shotgun and missile launcher, but these both have a limited supply of ammunition. If your bullet counter reaches one, you can only fire one bullet at a time, so you need to find some more. Also, it is important not to waste all of your missiles: you might need them later when you deal with later enemies like Mr. Big. You are also backed up by a chopper and a mean shiny street machine.

More often than not, when you blow up enemies, you can pick up several items that they drop, including drugs, money, ammunition, missile launchers, and if you're lucky, safe cards.  Even if you got the safe card and can pass the level, you can keep blowing up enemies to score more points. According to the game, this game is for training purposes only, so you will not get employed by your local DEA office. Is this what the DEA does every day: go on rampages?</resource>

The game plays like a strategic third person shooter. You control the commander of the current squad, and can switch between the three. Also, there are computer terminals scattered around that can turn off some of the automated defenses and cameras.</resource>

The game's representation technique is relatively revolutionary as it uses 'rotating scrolling' graphics. This means that the camera stays on the character while he moves around the column. 
The aim of the game is to climb towers in the given time to destroy them. Of course, a number of enemies and traps will block the character's path. Expect to encounter a fairly high difficulty on the first level. When the character is hit, he does not die but he goes down one floor. He only dies if he falls into the water.</resource>

The game can be played up to five levels; and the higher the level, the more ships players have to destroy. The ships vary in their size, speed, and destructive capability. Not only do they attack Alpha IV, but they also attack your weapons pod, so the point is to wipe them out before they have a chance to attack.

Missiles are fired at the ships from the weapons pod which rotate through 360 degrees. The control panel shows where the attacking ship is, leaving the player to find it and destroy it. Only one ship attacks at any time and it continues to attack until the ship is either destroyed or the time limit expires. If the 'Turrent Damaged' message appears, traversing will be slow until the self repair systems fixes the damage, giving the ships more chance to continue their attack on Alpha IV.

If all the ships have been wiped out, the player is returned to the title screen to select a new game. On harder levels, missiles that come from alien ships have a disturbing frequency and precision.</resource>

Things have got a lot harder now due to alien starships placing radiation pods on each planets surface and various creatures to protect them. Each of the pods have started producing radiation and when they reach a critical level then the planets will be destroyed, so with your jet-pack and laser you must fly over the planets surfaces and destroy the pods. Once all the pods are destroyed on a planet you move to the next one with the highest radiation level.</resource>

    <resource id="5fd7224326f4333f481ec5594cab5746923e653f" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">One day, a kiwi tribe was having fun and games outside the zoo, only to be kidnapped by the evil-minded Leopard Seal, who plans to sell them at the black market. Fortunately, during the kidnapping process, Tiki, leader of the tribe, managed to escape the sack, and her job is to rescue Phee-Phee and the other kiwis scattered around New Zealand, and are held in cages in various locations that include Auckland, Rotorua, Waitomo Caves, Strait Cook, and Mt. Cook. 

If Tiki doesn't rescue a kiwi in a limited amount of time, the devil will appear and try to kill her. When Tiki reaches the outskirts of each city, except Strait Cook, there is a boss waiting to meet Tiki, and kill her by using their own choice of weapons. Also making the rescue mission difficult are several nasties that attempt to throw their own weapons, like bombs and arrows, at her. To defeat these enemies, Tiki shoots at them using her crossbow and arrows. More often than not, when Tiki shoots at enemies, they will leave behind pieces of fruit that she can pick up for points. However, it is likely that Tiki may get other weapons or the letters E, X, T, E, N, and D. Collecting all these letters will result in an extra life, and as for the weapons, they include laser shots, bombs, and fireballs. 

In some levels, a few areas are located further up than just left or right, and the only way that Tiki can go up is by snatching something off the enemy that gives her the ability to fly up. Other areas are underwater, and when Tiki goes underwater, her oxygen  meter decreases, so she has to rise up to the surface again to restore her oxygen levels. Apart from her own weapons, Tiki is able to squirt water at enemies if she gets to the top of the water.</resource>

    <resource id="5ef59ad7ec29d287917f61c0f5e01641e1ba2476" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Based on the famous movie, A Nightmare of Elm Street is an action game, where you choose one of the five characters and try to free your friends from the grasp of the evil Freddy Krueger. 

You start on the city streets, where you have to find Freddy's house while avoiding Freddy himself. Once you're inside, you're free to explore the many floors of the house. You have to find your friends before Freddy kills them; the game shows you on which level each of your friends is and how much health he has left. 

Your character has two meters: a &amp;quot;soul&amp;quot; meter and a &amp;quot;power&amp;quot; meter. The &amp;quot;soul&amp;quot; is your health, and if it runs out, you die. The &amp;quot;power&amp;quot; allows you to use your special attack, different for every character. On your way, you'll meet a lot of monsters, which you can try to defeat with weapons or with your special attack. 

While walking around the house, you'll find many items you can pick up and use (but note that you have limited space in your inventory). Some items heal you, some are weapons and some have other uses. You'll also find batteries, bullets and coins - coins will allow you to buy various useful things, and batteries and bullets are necessary for some items to work.</resource>

    <resource id="cf16f54eee5dd9273d8ef967075f2c3085e5c418" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">This interactive fiction game is based on Roger Zelazny's fantasy novels Nine Princes In Amber (1970) and The Guns of Avalon (1972).

The game begins with you as Prince Corwin forced to compete against your eight scheming noble brothers and sisters for the throne of Amber at the center of the one true world. Corwin must travel across the dimensions to this fascinating realm and from there rally forces against those who would oppose him. Unfortunately, things do not always proceed as planned.

When you wake up, you know little of this, as you have been knocked unconscious and pummeled with drugs. All you have is the address of your scheming sister.

The game is largely based around interaction with other characters, and can end in 40 different ways depending on how these work.</resource>

Each level depicts a different locale and is divided into several screens. The game is presented in an isometric view and the ninja can move in eight different directions and jump.

Enemies, armed with fists and various ninja weapons, wander around the levels. The ninja must fight them either bare-handed or with the weaponry he finds along the way; in either case, he has a number of blows and attacks at his disposal, as well as the ability to block. There is a special weapon, shuriken, which are thrown in a straight line rather than used for melee combat; if they strike an enemy, they will instantly kill or at least severely damage them.

Various items scattered around the levels, such as keys, a rope and a map; collecting these items and using them in a proper place is necessary for completing the game. There are also hamburgers that award an extra life when eaten.

The game continues from the aftermath of the events of The Last Ninja. With the Koga scrolls now in his possession, Armakuni has begun training a new order of shadow warriors. During a training session, he is mysteriously transported to 20th-century New York City. Torn from his own time, Armakuni must defeat the evil shogun Kunitoki once more.

The Last Ninja Remix re-release version has an added short intro sequence, minor graphic changes and a remixed soundtrack.</resource>

The player(s) controlled robot Ninjas, which battled their way through the levels using Shuriken and knives. As the Ninja's took damage their classic Ninja garb was torn away to reveal robotic limbs, torso or head. When the damage reached critical the Ninja Robot would explode, scattering mechanical body parts.

As with The Sales Curve's later title SWIV, The Ninja Warriors used the company's Dynamic Loading System to load sprites, sound and background graphics from disk on the fly.</resource>

    <resource id="43cc80b058ce93b0c552f3a82acd14cac83545d6" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">This game shares two major similarities to The Great Escape - firstly, it's licensed around a venerable film, using the setting to new effect. Secondly, it's isometrically-viewed (with monochrome graphics, even on the capable-of-far-better C64) and features full object interaction of the Filmation style - this is taken further here, as the physics of the objects are varied by their shape and centre of gravity.

There are three stages to complete. In the first you play Johnathan Harker, who must retrieve some papers (he works for an Estate Agent's) and escape the castle. The second level introduces Johnathan's wife Lucy, and van Helsing, with play switching between the three. Lucy's role is slightly different as it is she who pursues the vampire itself, and she takes on the task alone in level 3.

Food must be collected to keep the characters' strength up, and crucifixes and candles can be picked up to help matters.</resource>

Each city has a bubble shield that can sustain one hit; another hit to an unshielded city will destroy it.

Players control a ship that can fire lasers horizontally and drop bomb vertically. The ship is also equipped with an energy beam that can absorb energy from energy tanks, and can also use that energy to create temporary shields around unprotected cities. The ship can also sustain up to ten blows in each round. If all four cities are destroyed or the ship takes ten hits in a round, the game ends.

Nova Blast is a single player game with three difficulty levels.</resource>

Uranium 235 itself finally ran out but huge deposits of the mineral were discovered on the many moons of Saturn and a deal was brokered with the dictator called Rayol the first to supply Earth with this precious mineral. Centuries later and Saturn has a new Premier called Rayol IV or Rayol the Perverse and he has decided that he requires a zoo containing different races of the Earth's inhabitants and so has demanded Earth give him 1000 of it's inhabitants. Earth rejected this claim and so Rayol has stopped Uranium 235 from being delivered to Earth and with stockpiles on Earth getting low and the potential for mass starvation something has to be done. Instead of sending a mass force to wage war on Rayol and the planet Saturn, the leaders of Earth have decide to send one man to participate in a surprise raid. You have been the man selected for this important mission, and in your ship loaded with nine robots you have to visit all of Saturn's moons, transport down a robot and collect as much Uranium 235 as you can.</resource>

But watch out for the evil creatures you've disturbed and the rising underground river - don't let either one touch you or you will die! And beware - the creatures move much faster while the moon is up. The river is unstoppable, but you can kill or block the creatures with a limited supply of dynamite.

O'Riley's Mine is essentially a high-speed variant of Mr. Do! and Boulder Dash - you must race around collecting everything before returning to the top of the mine shaft while the creatures chase you and the water rises relentlessly.</resource>

When simply exploring, the player could select from six different species of fish, such as Mackinaw Trout, Whitefish, or Rainbow Trout; however, when playing for points, the computer randomly assigned the type of fish that the player will play as. In addition, the titles for each of the types of fish and other creatures are removed when playing for points, forcing the player to rely on memory; also the game was timed. After every five moves, the player played as a different type of fish.</resource>

After the player enters his/her name (which is used later in the personal letter to Santa), the first level takes the form of a flip-screen collecting game with Santa at home gathering the scattered pieces of his sleigh. If he collides with one of the elves running around, the item he is carrying is lost and has to be found again.

The player chooses six presents they want (computer, doll, book, etc.), which are listed on their letter to Santa. Santa then collects the presents as they fall from the top of the screen.

Finally Santa can deliver the presents, riding his sleigh over several horizontally-scrolling continents. The presents are dropped with parachutes and should be delivered to the homes indicated by arrows. Clouds and aeroplanes can knock them off course.</resource>

Extend your oil-mining robotic arm deep below the earth's crust to mine oil and line your pockets. But watch out for the monstrous bugs that lie in wait for you -- one touch of them to the robotic arm and you lose a life!</resource>

Finding these and reassembling the car is done in several stages. First you must find a magnifying glass, and use this to examine the screens thoroughly to find each part. Once you obtain the car part, you will need a spanner to be able to do anything with it. Armed with these, you must head to the basement, to be able to put it back together.

Bonus items can be found, ranging from essential keys and candlelight recharges to extra lives and telephones.</resource>

It is split into 24 tough screens to complete in order, none of which are designed to be easy for a human to navigate.

Ollie's Follies is a simple 2D sci-fi platformer displaying the kind of horizontally layered environments Frank Cohen became well known for. Each level's objective is disarmingly simple - just get from one end of the screen to the other. These contain teleports, guard robots to avoid, and an array of complex ledges to navigate. Later screens add moving platforms, laser bolts and deflectors, and require a key be collected to open the door. Be careful not to fall too far, as this costs you one of your five lives, as does contact with a robot.</resource>

The goal is to design a powerful tank capable of defeating opponents within the frames of a limited budget. A successful completion of this task grants the player character a higher security clearance and a large budget. Combat plays little to no role in the game; the gameplay is dedicated to designing the tanks themselves. The player programs tanks by using a built-in text editor. It is possible to assign different artificial intelligence script commands that control various aspects of the tank, as well as enable communication between several tanks in a group. The player must take into account the equipment of a tank and its attributes in order to design a vehicle that would prove successful in combat.</resource>

    <resource id="ed2c5c16058129850c2ef6b39299e896d970c997" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">This is a remake of a Bally-Midway arcade game. You control a spaceship and shoot down the enemy &amp;quot;Droid&amp;quot; ships that attack you. Your ship must survive Droid-dropped mines too--but you can shoot them too. The last ship of the Droid flights goes into a spiraling pattern.

There is no end to this game. Rather, it is a game in which you try to get the highest score, or complete the highest number of levels.

You control a small triangle that is your ship. The ship can turn, move forward (with thrusters) and fire. Movement is one of the games challenges; once the ship is moving, it can only be slowed by turning the nose in the opposite direction and use the thrusters. While doing that, the ship is unable to fire toward anything it is in motion toward.

Bouncing also comes into play during movement. When the ship hits the side of the screen, a wall of force appears, and the ship bounces. You don't have control over where the ship bounces, and must take time to regain control, before you run into an enemy ship and die.</resource>

The positive result of this is that you can (and to win must) play angled volleys and precisely-placed lob and drop shots. The gameplay is thus more tactical than many tennis games; choosing the move to outfox your opponent comes into play.

1 or 2 player, 3 or 5 set matches can be played, or asphalt, clay or grass. The four computer players are inspired by Jimmy Conners, Björn Borg, John McEnroe and Ivan Lendl. Court layout and service rules are accurate. The AI player watches your playing style and can step up a gear in quality if it needs to.</resource>

    <resource id="ebeae8c389d9d2c18aaa056e81bbb40f916af8bf" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">On-Field Football is a game based on the sport of American Football where you can play the computer or another player following the rules closely. Before you play a game you can select how many players or a demo game, how long for a game (5 or 15 mins), and how the players will play a game. The view of the pitch is a 3rd person perspective at a elevated angle with the action behind the offensive team. 

The game kicks off and once the player catching the ball is tackled then decisions need to be made. Using the joystick, you push it up, down, left or right to select a play and this needs to be selected within 30 seconds. Once both teams have selected then you can control either the quarter back if offensive or a defender if defensive. Once the quarterback has passed it the player with the ball is under your control. You are also able to punt the ball or kick the ball for the extra point or a field goal.</resource>

You can choose between a male and female frog in the References section. There are two game modes: Dissect and Reconstruct. In Dissect mode, players have to cut open the frog's body and remove its organs; and in Reconstruct mode, players have to put the already removed organs back to the frog's body in the correct order. This game offers you scissors, a probe, a magnifying glass and tweezers - the necessary tools for your work. The scissors (not available in Reconstruct section) help you cut the frog's body and remove organs, the probe gives you hints of where to cut (in Dissect section) or which part to place first (in Reconstruct section), the magnifying glass gives you information about each organ, and the tweezers help you move the organs. You don't have to remove all the organs to see their information as you can look them up anytime at the Frog File Index section. You can also see the arrangement of the organs at the OptiFrog section. The game offers players a saving function.</resource>

    <resource id="02016611d5b3237f7db3db06e59f51eaf23aa2f1" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Lee Ho Fook and his forces has invaded Campuchia and forced the population to work as slaves in his Jade Mines. The mines are being plundered to sell to Middle East arms dealers who are supplying parts to a new super-tank disguised as oil refinery parts. You are the leader of a small force sent in to destroy the tank before Lee Ho Fook uses it to invade the surrounding areas.

Operation Hanoi is a one player game where the action is viewed as a 1st person perspective as the game scrolls to the right. Enemy soldiers and vehicles appear from the sides and top of the screen. You control crosshairs on the screen to aim and fire; grenades can also be thrown.

You only have so much ammo so shoot parachutes falling from the sky which carry extra ammo as well as 1st aid boxes to keep you alive. As well as your main playing area you can also see your score, ammo, lives, amount of enemy and a hits bar.</resource>

    <resource id="c9122580a0e9fc5407848a4b61f75c5c5d672044" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Operation Thunderbolt is the exciting sequel to Operation Wolf. An airliner is hijacked by terrorists en-route from Paris to Boston, who threaten to kill all hostages on board if their mates aren't released from jail. Instead of reaching its destination, the airliner makes a landing in Kalubya, Africa, and all the hostages are hidden in various locations. The authorities have asked the hero from Operation Wolf to rescue the hostages, but only this time, the hero brings his friend along for the ride.

There are eight missions to complete in Operation Thunderbolt, and each one has you shooting down soldiers, choppers, and tanks. The gameplay varies every one or two missions. In some missions, you are driving a jeep or controlling a boat, while in others, you are walking while you're shooting. You have a limited supply of ammo, and a limited supply of rocket bombs, but you can always stock up by shooting down crates falling from the sky, or by killing a cat or dog that get in the line of fire. Also from crates, you can get special items like bulletproof vests, rocket bombs, and different weapons.

You also have a life bar to worry about. If you're shot at by soldiers, or if rocket bombs or grenades are thrown at you, you 'll lose energy, and once you're energy is depleted,  you lose one of your three lives. You can lose a lot of energy by killing hostages on purpose,  and you can't easily avoid killing them if you decide to use rocket bombs to wipe out enemies. The eighth mission, the mission that involves you fighting terrorists on a plane,  proves to be difficult because a woman in a blue dress stands up and gets in the line of fire, and you have to very careful when you're going to use rocket bombs.

There are two endings to this game, and which ending you can watch will depend on the number of hostages you've saved, and whether or not you shot the pilot instead of the mission eight boss.</resource>

As a battalion commander of an armored task force the player is ordered to capture (within 35 game turns, divided into phases) a city 15 kilometers away, defended by opposing forces. At your disposal are infantry, engineer, recon, tank and artillery units. Dig in your troops, deploy bridges, watch for enemy mines and barrage fire.

The player's task is to maneuver over open ground on a battle grid three screens five separate parts: 1.Unit placement and disposition phase: Dug in and defending, or In motion on recon.
2.Forces Movement phase: vertically or horizontally on the grid map, using the joystick. When in motion, firing is not possible. Enemy units are invisible until they fire on you, and mine fields are not visible until you hit them.
3.Combat phase: Here you are engaged by artillery and small arms fire.
4.Assault Order phase: . In this phase you are able to advance and maneuver your units that have not exhausted their ammunition in the prior operations against enemy formations, utilizing head on assaults, or fast flanking armored attacks. Enemy units will be dislodged and will move, using their own firepower to attempt to break up your attacks. The player will need to engage his engineer units to bridge river crossings while in action.
5.Final assault phase: The orders given in the prior phase become a mixed bag in the fog of war, and the gamer must react to circumstances that naturally occur as previously undetected enemy units deploy against the assaults as they unfold.
With the conclusion of each turn of five phases, the player will be assessed of his success or failure, and will be offered the opportunity to save or delete the prior game action before continuing to the next turn. There are four increasingly difficult levels of engagement, each of which will result in five levels of outcome, from total victory, through stalemate, to abject defeat.</resource>

Through a series of missions, you'll engage a variety of enemies, from soldiers to ninjas, patrol boats to helicopters, and more. 
It is a &amp;quot;rail-shooter&amp;quot;, where you basically hold the gun and shoot just about everything that moves, while conserving your ammo and grenades.  Your primary machine gun can kill everything if you hit it enough times, but you can also use the grenade launcher for really deadly targets like helicopters or armored cars. You can collect a machine gun which will allow you to shoot faster for a few seconds.
You'll be pummelled by a LOT of enemies. Some will be shooting, others will be tossing grenades, knifes, ... Some are armored and requires more than a few hits, others dodges. You can shoot grenades and knifes out of the air if you aim well enough.
Bosses appear at the end of some levels, and each has a specific weakness you need to exploit.</resource>

    <resource id="c3450b9af18d5e4158f4c093c4008f48831d5212" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Overrun! offers meticulous simulation of late twentieth-century squad-level action in European and Middle Eastern terrain. Players command a battalion of infantry, armor, artillery, and helicopters on behalf of Arab states, Iran, Israel, NATO, and the Warsaw Pact. The bulk of scenarios are speculative and near-future (including an Iranian invasion of Kuwait), but one historic war is presented, the 1973 Arab-Israeli &amp;quot;October War.&amp;quot; A single-player campaign of randomly generated maps starts you with a core force which you will hopefully retain and expand with each victory.

SSI builds on its Panzer Strike engine with this release. Each unit has several static attributes, from size to morale, and a changing state based on orders and circumstance which determine its combat effectiveness from moment to moment. Weapons -- and there are dozens -- are carefully detailed with six characteristics of their own. Vehicle armor is distinguished by location, so facing plays an important role, too. The manual gives a thorough explanation of the mechanics, including formulas, plus a nineteen-page supplement of tables.

The currency of each turn is orders, gained and spent by each command unit. Without orders, your squads will only continue what they're doing or react to what is being done to them. If they lose their commanding superior, control goes to the computer. Orders are issued almost in real-time, because movement and actions occur in twenty-second (game-time) pulses and run continuously until a player interrupts the action to issue commands. This combination of a fragile chain of command and continuous play means that letting your eyes glaze over can turn the unexpected into total defeat.

The play screen is devoted to a small-scale map, fifty yards per square, with one level of outward zoom. A lot of scrolling is a necessity to judge the terrain, but a helpful line-of-sight tool removes some of the guesswork. Below the map is a menu of abbreviated commands and submenus, with a status line for the selected unit or terrain. Terrain factors are modified in-game with smoke, whether fired by units or resulting from burning vehicles and vegetation.

The scenarios can be played solitaire, hot-seat with two players, or entirely by the computer. A scenario editor gives complete control over map creation and initial forces, plus three different types of engagements, several objectives, and five levels of difficulty.</resource>

You control a naval hydrofoil missile boat, and need to complete a variety of different missions. Some of the missions include destroying all enemy vessels in a given area, surveillance requiring you to identify the location of enemy ships (without sinking them!), or to escort a supply ship through hostile territory. As missions are successfully completed you earn points based on how successful the mission was, and with increasing points you can advance in rank, from deck mopper up to admiral. Your performance on one mission won't have an affect on future ones, and you can choose to play missions out of order as well.  Several missions include other craft you can control to help out (both ships and helicopters). A time compression mode is included, which can be used to reduce the amount of time waiting to arrive at a destination, or even left on to make the action sequences more challenging.</resource>

    <resource id="60e43994c3e316da6bd9a07be6fd3cfd71fa3df1" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">One of the most popular and influential games of the 1980's, Pac-Man stars a little, yellow dot-muncher who works his way around to clear a maze of the various dots and fruit which inhabit the board.

Pac-Man's goal is continually challenged by four ghosts: The shy blue ghost Bashful (Inky), the trailing red ghost Shadow (Blinky), the fast pink ghost Speedy (Pinky), and the forgetful orange ghost Pokey (Clyde).  One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Pac-Man.

Pac-Man can turn the tables on his pursuers by eating of the four Energizers located within the maze.  During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points.  This only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghost's eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Pac-Man again.

Survive a few rounds of gameplay, and be treated to humorous intermissions between Pac-Man and the ghosts.</resource>

You need to guide Pac-Man around a maze and eat all of the dots on the board in order to proceed on to the next round. Numerous, multi-colored ghosts also roam the maze trying to stop you. If you eat one of the power pellets in the maze, the ghosts will temporarily turn blue and run from you. Pac-man can earn bonus points by eating the ghosts when they are in this state. The maze is now in 3-D and is larger than screen which will scroll to follow the action. To help get out of tight spots, Pac-Man now has the ability to jump. But be careful, because some of the ghosts have learned this trick as well and you could end up in a mid air collision!</resource>

He has to avoid the octopuses that chase him around the maze. If he comes into contact with an octopus he will lose one life.

    <resource id="bcbc7152c480650059d94151641a648bd8619083" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Pang is a platform game which consists of 50 levels in total. It can be played with one or two players on the same screen, and the other player can join anytime within the game. 

Your goal is to destroy the balloons which bounce around the playfield. To accomplish this, you can shoot hooks which travel upwards, and blow up any balloon they touch. Depending on their size, they either split on two smaller ones, or evaporate if they're at their minimum size. Apart from balloons, some levels also have barriers that have to be destroyed with your hooks, since they often block your access to balloons. There are also some barriers which cannot ever be destroyed. Your character has the ability to climb ladders, but cannot jump. 

You can also pick up power-ups such as: the ability to fire two shots at once, the hook that attaches to the ceiling and waits 'til something bumps into it, a gun which has a high rate of fire but cannot destroy barriers. Beside extra weapons, you can also pick certain things like clock (halting time for a small period), dynamite (reducing all balls to minimum size, thus making you able to reach more points), life, and such.</resource>

This can be done by laying bombs on the platforms that these monsters are on. When these bombs are detonated, they leave a hole in the platform, and when the monsters fall through these, they drop down a level, destroying them. As the player progresses through the game, the monsters need to be dropped through more levels to kill them. Lives are lost when the player touches a monster or when they are in the vicinity of the bomb when it detonates.</resource>

You can attempt each course in competition mode or practise mode with both being played solo or against a friend and there are three levels of difficulty. You can also have a preview of each course. The actual game is viewed from the side and the screen scrolls from left to right as you waggle the joystick (or keyboard) left to right to move. If playing in two player mode then the screen is split into two and you compete at the same time. There are various obstacles you need to clear to complete the course and these include walls, parallel bars, rope swing, thin wall and a death slide. The winner is the person with the fastest time.

You control an &amp;quot;Influence Device&amp;quot; which can temporarily control other droids and use their weapons to destroy the others. When your power is low or your damage is high, you will need to transfer to another droid or risk losing your Influence Device.

For this you control an influence device of the series (001), which can connect to other robots, to control them after a successful takeover. This is really necessary as the (001) series is only equipped with a weak laser and a low protection shield. Unfortunately, the circuits of each &amp;quot;host robot&amp;quot; get damaged by the external control, the higher developed the robot, the bigger is the damage. The task of the player is to eliminate the hostile robots on 16 decks per ship, either by taking them over or by the use of a weapon. There are altogether 24 robot types in 10 classes.
This Paradroid Competition Edition is faster and more fluent to the original.</resource>

Its code is far too complex for you to crack, so you must find scientists, drug them, and bring them to The Big One. Each will be able to unlock one letter. Simply finding these scientists is the hard part - The Big One has aliens patrolling its base, and they are more than capable of ganging up on you. In essence Parallax is a top-view multi-directional-scrolling shoot 'em up. Improved weaponry and shield recharges can be bought by the machine - can you think of a way to get money from a drugged scientist? You can duck under the layers of surface, but so can the aliens, so action can take place here. You can also get out of your ship and patrol the area on foot. The game's parallax scrolling routine inspired the title, and it also has 11-minute introductory music.</resource>

This game will test you to see if you're really up to the job. You play a park ranger, whose job is to collect twelve items scattered around the park, such as soda cans, bottles, and balls. Unfortunately, getting these items is not as easy as it sounds, as your task gets difficult by swimmers, swamps, snakes, turtles, and ants. To make matters worse, your energy gets depleted quickly, so to restore it, you can either return to your hut, or snatch food off an ant's back in later levels. More often than not, some of the turtles will follow you into the lake. If they enter the lake, you can run them over for 500 points before they decide to jump back out again.

Besides collecting items, you also must rescue swimmers that are about to drown in the lake. Fail to rescue a swimmer in a limited amount of time, and you'll also drown, and the same can be said if you bump into snakes. Rather than collecting items, you  can also roll on logs. Doing this will earn you 5000 points if you manage to roll for a long time. There are five levels of Park Patrol to complete, and once you complete all of them, the diffculty level gets higher and the game becomes much more difficult. To give you an example, the turtles will stop at nothing to kill you, and there will be more than one swimmer to rescue at once.

This game can have two players. Park Patrol even provides you with a menu, in which you can alter the number of turtles, ants, swamps, swimmers, and snakes in each of the five levels. With the menu, you can have none of these in every level, but what's the fun of completing a level without any enemies to avoid? Also, you can play as a boy or a girl.</resource>

The player travels from France, to Australia, to the US and end up in England and get to listen to the national anthem of each country. 

There are four difficulty levels to select the skill of the computer controlled player. One or two players may play but always against the computer. In a two player game, both players play as a doubles team.

The game starts off looking behind the player as the style of serve is chosen (top spin, curve, etc) and then it switches to a top down view for the rally.</resource>

Looking into the past. Searching it. Unearthing its mysteries and uncovering its adventures. The Ruling Council had bestowed this critical task to an elite group of stellar explorers. Known simply as, Pastfinders.

To join their ranks, one must possess the stamina to search hundreds of uncharted lands. The knowledge to select only the proper tools for survival. The ability to dissect complex maps. And, the unending desire to live dangerously.

As the war is fought you get points, and the objective, of course is to gather as much points as possible (positive points if you're Allied, negative if you're Axis). Although it's strategical simulation is rather simplistic, taking a more entertaining approach, it has many features, available options and a lot of feedback from the computer (including tips from the computerized Patton's and Rommel's).

The game had a feature very similar to today's well-known Fog-of-War, though it's functionality was not as smooth as it is today. The warzone is divided into Zones of Control, with it's units and actions invisible to the adversary until he attempts to move through it and fight for it.</resource>

The Roobikyoub dwarves have been banished from the kingdom, which is not good as they produce high-quality whisky. King Erik is not popular for this decision, as some feel that ale brewers and mineral water bottlers have influenced him. Honest John the trader and Kronos the Magician play a key role in your journey, each offering sub-quests to attempt.

The package includes a novella complete with map and decipherable hints, which are accessed by typing 'hint' followed by the code into the computer. Therefore, those with only a pirated copy would struggle to complete the game.

Your score and the number of locations visited are both displayed in the title bar. The parser allows whole words to be deleted and unaccepted previous entries to be re-edited.</resource>

To do this, you need to jump up and grab stars from the top of the screen which can be used to power the sandwich machine. Some stars are too high to reach by just jumping; on either side of the screen is a spring board which can be used to launch your partner higher. After making sandwiches, you can then eat them to replenish your energy supply. Eating sandwiches also makes your character heavier which allows you to launch your partner even higher when jumping on the spring board. On some levels you need to watch out for Snarfs which will eat your sandwiches! The game ends when you run out of energy.</resource>

For three thousand years, the tomb has been a mystery and deathtrap. It is rumored that the chambers contain dark and terrible dangers for those that would make the pharaoh's treasure their own. And even more ghastly, the pharaoh and the guardian mummy are said to walk the chambers for all eternity, destroying all trespassers in the tomb. You've heard it all before and lived to tell about it and this is a chance of a lifetime. You've spent months finding these ruins and finally you're here at the fabled tomb. Still... what if the legends are true? As you descend into the first chamber, you hear footsteps...</resource>

On each level there are a variety of symbols arranged in columns on the screen. By moving the symbols around, you need to create columns which contain identical symbols; once all the symbols in a column are the same, that column disappears. Your goal is to earn points and complete the levels by making all of the symbols on the screen disappear. Occasionally, you may become stuck with a symbol that doesn't match anything onscreen; when this happens, you can call for an additional symbol to drop onto the screen. However, as the symbol which appears is random you may need to create quite a few symbols before the one you need appears. Each level has a time limit in which it needs to be completed; run out of time and you lose a life; lose all lives and the game is over.

In addition to the regular symbols, there are also some special objects on the screen which may help or hinder your progress. These include bombs which destroy several symbols at once, blocks which may get in the way or be arranged to help out, death heads which diminish time more quickly, and flower pots which can't be moved.</resource>

Space Wolves have arrived in a Intergalactic Space ship to attack you and your friends and you must shoot them all to stop them. The wolves appear from the top of the screen carried by balloons or heli-packs, and move down the screen towards the ground firing space dust at you. You must avoid the dust while shooting back with your pig lazer and if you are hit then you lose one of three lives. If any wolf hits the ground then they move across it before moving up the right of the screen towards you and can't be shot. Once twenty wolves have been killed then you can move the basket to the ground and walk across the ground to your waiting friend on the left of the screen. Atomic mortar bombs are dropped from the ship above and must be avoided or it is a loss of life. Once your friend has been rescued then it's onto the next level and another friend to save.</resource>

The game was delivered on cartridge. A speciality is the controls by paddle, which is done in port #1. If no game is played, a demo is shown.

The flipper simulation is a mixture of pinball and breakout. The square-cut ball is rolled over the pinball table with the help of a double board similar to Breakout. As pinball elements, there are -next to walls- also two bumpers (upper right and left), the Commodore logo (in the middle of the screen), the light C O M M O D O R E with the corresponding targets, two spinners, four sideways ball traps (middle and bottom) and a point display. Furthermore, there is a time-sensitive ball barrier to avoid the ball going into out. The overview line with ball display, active player and points is in the first line of the screen. You have 3 balls per game.</resource>

To win each match you must get to 10 points with a 2 point lead - if the scores reach 10-9 the game goes on until someone has a 2 point lead or reaches 15, in a similar manner to tennis. There are nine skill levels to beat, with increasing abilities as the game goes on. The human player has the advantage of serving first, and as the serve reverses every five points, you are guaranteed to have more chances to serve than your opponent (remember the significance of 10 and 15 in the scoring). The points system rewards long rallies and large winning margins, as you get points for each hit, for each point won, and for each point of the winning margin.</resource>

To help you in this, Panther can use various items, such as a little bell, which he can use to attract the sleeping man.

The game is a sidescrolling adventure and takes mostly place in the house of the employer. Pink Panther can himself move freely in the house, but at the same time he needs to keep his eye on the sleepwalker, so that he can prevent him from stumbling on various objects, such as rugs and tables.

Before each level you can purchase different kind of objects from a store. These items can be used to gently lure the sleeping man in the right path.</resource>

This game lets you choose from 6 different &amp;quot;ages&amp;quot; (for example, &amp;quot;The Silver Empire&amp;quot; from 1560-1600, &amp;quot;War For Profit&amp;quot; from 1640-1660, etc.), one of 4 nationalities (English, French, Dutch, Spanish), 4 difficulty levels, and one of 5 special abilities (skill at fencing, skill at navigation, etc.). Nine different types of ships were represented.

The goal of the game is to retire with as much gold and land as possible, as many ranks/titles as possible (Colonel, Admiral, Marquis, Duke), and a wife. Finding long lost relatives helps too. You accomplish these goals by plundering cities, capturing and sinking enemy ships, getting in good with governors to receive titles, learn news of &amp;quot;evil Spaniards&amp;quot; holding your relatives, capturing evil pirates, etc.</resource>

Poisonous frogs, eels, scorpions, bats and other hazards get in the way.

Pitfall II is the sequel to Pitfall!, the original platform game. Gameplay has remained pretty much the same, with each screen presenting a side view of obstacles to get past, and potentially treasures to collect. The landscape is more maze like, with a variety of paths and dead ends to search. Along the way there are checkpoints the player will encounter in the form of red crosses. When the player dies, Pitfall Harry will be sent back to the most recently crossed checkpoint. The score is reduced based on the distance travelled to get to the cross.

As he explores Harry can collect gold bars which give him a 5000 points award. His total score acts as an energy reserve. If the score is reduced to zero then the game ends and the player must restart from the beginning.</resource>

Your goal is to earn as much money as possible by winning races in the Grand Circuit which consists of a race on each of the six tracks; each time a race is completed, you'll earn money based on how you placed and the number of laps completed before moving on. While you are racing, keep an eye on your tires and fuel; if your tires become too worn (causing a blowout) or you run out of fuel, the game will be over. To prevent this from happening, you'll need to make a pitstop. Here you control the pit crew and can replace tires and refuel. While in the pit the race is still going on, of course, so repairs need to be made as quickly as possible to get back into the race without losing too much ground. Several game options are available to control the level of difficulty and the number of laps. In addition to the Grand Circuit which is the full race, you can also practice a track in a single race or enter the mini circuit which consists of three races.</resource>

    <resource id="8ca2e67b852da81c0f9d08ccf8aabc42f1eb7aee" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">The film Platoon featured a squad of five soldiers on their mission for the US Army in Vietnam. In this action game based around the film, you take control of these five guys in turn, with the chance to switch between them as they each take one of the 3 hits that would kill them.

The game recreates each of the sections of the film, starting with a side-scrolling journey through the jungle, with paths to cross both horizontally and vertically, and the ability to jump or duck hazards. You will need to blow up a bridge and then locate a village, which contains a torch, a map and a trap-door. The enemy has booby-trapped the area and are launching airstrikes, so the danger is not all from enemy ground soldiers.

The next section is in first-person 3D, as you move through a network of tunnels in search of flares and a compass. There are 3 distinct control methods, changing from the standard motion when an enemy appears (this puts you in control of a cross-hair for more accurate targeting), and when you enter a room to search.

After escaping this you settle in a bunker overnight, and have a limited amount of flares with which to locate incoming enemy, and must then shoot them before they can shoot you. The jungle airstrike from the film is the next moment - you have two minutes to rush into a safe position to the north, using your compass for guidance.

Finally you face the treacherous Sergeant Barnes, and must hit him with grenades 5 times whilst trapped in a foxhole to prevent him wiping you out.</resource>

To do this, George has to lay pipes from a valve in the bottom left of the screen to the tank in the top right. At the bottom of the screen are six different shaped pipes and when George runs over one, he can lay down as many of that shape pipe until he changes shape again. As George lays the pipe, a bonus decreases as well as a pressure gauge increasing and when the gauge is full and the bonus reaches zero then the tank explodes and George loses one of three lives. If a pipe has been placed incorrectly then pressing F1 picks up a spanner and allows George to remove the pipe, and a press of F3 drops the spanner so George can pick up pipes again.</resource>

Similar to Q*Bert, the player changes the color of the object they land on, in Pogo Joe's case these are barrels as opposed to cubes, until the entire level is changed to the new color. Also, the levels can look like something other than a pyramid. There are enemies to avoid, and properties of the barrels also vary. Instead of discs that Q*Bert uses to escape his foes, there is the super jump ability as well as certain colored barrels a player can use to clear the enemies off the screen.</resource>

Before the player can enter the Grand Prix, the player must first qualify by competing in the Qualifying Lap within 73 seconds or less. If the player however, does not qualify in the Qualifying Lap, the player may continue to race until the Race Timer runs after 90 seconds. The player will score 50 point per 5 meters and additionally 50 points for every racing car passed. When the time runs out - Game Over. The player will have to restart the Qualifying Lap.

Qualifying will enable the player to start in one of the eight available positions. The faster the lap time was, the better the starting position in addition to bonus score points. The number one starting position, is the Pole Position.

During the Grand Prix, the player will compete against the Race Timer as well as against other racing cars. If the player fails to beat the Race Timer in any lap, the player drops out of the race - Game Over. Completing the race by reaching finishing line will grant the player 200 points per each second left on the Race Timer, bonus score for distance covered, and passing bonus points.

    <resource id="2787c6906e0732ba81f8505452773a4e4773fb2b" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">In this remake of the arcade game Pooyan from the early '80s, you play the role of a pig, protecting its piglets from wolves.  

The first screen takes place near the pigs' home.  Mrs. Pig rides up and down in a cable car, shooting at wolves, who are riding balloons downward, towards the ground.  If the wolves land safely on the ground, then they can climb a ladder, near the cable-car, and catch Mrs. Pig.  But if she shoots their balloons, they splat on the ground instead.

The wolves shoot acorns at the pig.  But Mrs. Pig has a food based weapon too.  If she gets to the top, she can get meat, to toss at the wolves and make them jump off their balloons in pursuit.  Each wolf taken out this way is worth bonus points (on a doubling scheme: 400, 800 1600...)

The second scene takes place at the wolves lair.  Here the wolves have reinforced balloons--it takes multiple hits to make them fall.  Here they float upwards toward a big rock, which they push on top of Mrs. Pig, when seven wolves are present.  Additionally, an alpha wolf (wolf leader) appears and summons wolves in packs.</resource>

Brutus wanders around the screen and is constantly trying to catch you. If you collect a can of spinach, you can temporarily knock him out, otherwise Brutus will knock you out. Other objects such as bottles or birds are also flying around the screen and will cause you to lose one of your lives if you are hit. Each level features a different layout of platforms and ladders, and will have you collecting different items as they float towards the bottom of the screen!</resource>

In Popeye 2, our spinach lovin' hero must once again rescue Olive Oyl and make mincemeat of Bluto while looking after Swee'Pea, feeding Wimpy and keeping an eye on Jeep.

Popeye has four different levels to traverse through. His initial adventure takes him to a construction site where bouncing springs, falling girders and open welding flames impede his progress. Rolling barrels, and bombs which must be touched to be put out also stand to cause harm. In every level scattered hamburgers must be collected in order for Popeye to get past Wimpy who is often hanging out somewhere near the top of every vertically scrolling platform level. There are also feats of strength that Popeye must perform by beating up a punching robot-type thing with the aid of Spinach. Once past all these obstacles Popeye can move on to the next level.

To find out which planets are weak, wrestling matches will be fought. The losers' planets will be conquered. Popeye has to wrestle five other aliens to keep Earth safe.

To help Popeye to win is Olive Oyl and Wimpy who throw spinach and hamburgers into the ring to keep up Popeye's energy. Collect enough spinach and Popeye can use his special move Turbo Typhoon Technique. The alien opponents will collect the hamburgers as well. Brutus is also at the fight and will throw in bombs to hinder Popeye. Popeye can steer his opponent onto the bomb as well.

Popeye 3 is a 1 or 2 player wrestling game shown from the side with the screen showing the whole of the ring. The joystick moves Popeye about the ring and with the fire button can perform various moves. When in a grapple the joystick needs to be waggled fast to throw the opponent onto the floor. Once the opponent is on the floor then it can be pinned.</resource>

The Nightmare Prince has stolen the Grand Dozer's sleep potion, and the pieces have been placed around the Dream Zone. The Midnight Patrol race into action to restore Dozer's decent night's sleep.

The game takes place across 5 levels of platform action. There are many switches, which are activated by pushing crates onto them. Moving platforms and small ledges ensure a test of timing and planning. There are hidden paths and bonuses to uncover, and dying always puts you back where you die with an invincibility period. Each character has its own special weapon or feature, all activated by hitting the fire key or button.</resource>

Bizarrely, considering the name of the game, the player takes the role of a gorilla. The gorilla is being hunted and must elude his captors. If successful they then do battle with the fearsome 'Teddy Twins'.

The game takes place on a grid with irregularly sized rectangles. Each rectangle has a score associated with it. By going around all four sides of the shape the player gets the score it contains. The objective here is to score on all squares.

Having survived this phase of the game the player then progresses to the second part of the game where they must guide a teddy bear towards a banana.

The third and final part of the game is similar to the first part but here the player takes the role, not of a gorilla but of a paint roller and the hunters are teddy bears.</resource>

There are 5 tracks to choose from, each with 5 stages. The stages range from cities, to deserts to tracks over water. There are also 12 drivers to pick from, from businessmen to skinheads and mohicans. 

Your buggy has 2 gears, high and low. Once the light goes green, just keep the pedal to the metal. You’ll need to place third or higher to continue to the next stage. Be careful not to bump into other buggies or objects next to the road. While you’re buggy can take a pounding, crashing will slow you down. 

Finish all 5 stages in a level and you’ll be presented with a bonus level.</resource>

The bad guys have anti-matter machines capable of destroying the planets' power source. You must destroy these before they can reach Critical Mass.

Your journey involves travelling primarily to the east, in a hovering craft. It is rotated with left and right movements, and accelerated with forward motion. Laser and shield strength are limited and monitored on screen. Use them wisely, as hostile aliens and mines line the route. Get shot down and you re-emerge with a jet pack, now directed to the bay which can give you a new craft. 

The force-field gates near the power planets are guarded by turrets which must be shot down. The mission then boils down the insides of the plant, which must be destroyed before its tractor beam has sucked you into the core.</resource>

Your boat is fitted with bombs, which can be placed so as to force the other boats to run over them, gaining you points.

It was captured and harnessed by the magicians of Baskalos, but its keeper Myglar has turned against them and is using it for himself. He must be defeated before the crystal is exhausted.

The typing interface is typical of Level 9 games of the era. Time saving features include an ALL command can apply TAKE and EXAMINE to every object you can see, and the ability to type future commands while the screen is still scrolling.

18 spells are available, activated using 3-letter codes you will discover while exploring. These range from confusing or angering an enemy to healing yourself and detecting danger.</resource>

The route to the castle in which her ugly sister has imprisoned her is treacherous and goes both indoors and out. You're armed with a dagger to face the many henchmen infesting the areas. Bread and ale can be collected to restore your health, and there are lots of points bonuses on offer. Less pleasant are the super glue, ball &amp; chain (ironic given that he's chasing a potential wife) and poison.</resource>

You have 15 minutes to find them and throwing them from the roof, but you must first complete a short word-unscrambling puzzle sequence to diffuse their booby-traps.

The bulk of the game is a flick-screen fighting game, similar to the Joe Blade series. Prisoners can be attacked with your rifle, or by kicking them in the head. Any other contact drains energy, and you have only one life. Keys are required to open security doors; these plus extra bullets and energy can be collected as you go.</resource>

Using crosshairs, aim your ball to the other side of the court and hope you hit where you want. If you are lucky, you might even score an Ace. If not, you will need to be ready to return your opponent's return. Run back and forth as you try to keep hitting the ball over the net until your opponent misses, or you do. When you hit the ball, you will want to attempt changing the direction and speed of the ball to throw your opponent off balance. This is the real challenge of any tennis game.</resource>

The Ice Zone contains oxygen bubbles which must be popped to keep you breathing well. Nejo needs feeding and taking to the showers regularly.

The game is viewed isometrically and smoothly scrolls, unlike other isometric games of the day.</resource>

The gameplay is simple: you're facing a row of buildings, a gangster pops up and you have to shoot him before the on-screen timer goes empty and he shoots you first. You can hide until the timer restarts but this is limited too. 
At the end of each stage is a bonus round where you have to shoot gangsters in a room, with no more ability to hide and a faster timer.
As you progress through each stage, the game will become faster, and enemies will become harder to find and to hit.
Of course, your goal is to reach the end of the game with the highest possible score.</resource>

Scattered around the area are supplies, and flying left or right, you must take them one at a time back to your base while the other player does the same. your helicopter is armed with with limited ammo and you must keep an eye on your fuel levels. Landing on your base places any supplies carried and you can re-arm and re-fuel as well. If you are shot while carrying supplies then the supplies are dropped and you lose part of a damage gauge. If you run out of fuel, take too much damage or crash then you go back to your base. Once you have collected enough supplies then they turn into a bomb which needs carrying and dropped on the other players base to win the game.</resource>

Like Defender, there are lots of different aliens to contend with, and some ground based enemies as well. There are no smart bombs, however. You have to rescue humans as well (twice) from both an alien ship, and later a city that will be overrun with lava from a volcano that erupts during the game; all the while protecting them from aliens. You then have to drop them one at a time (unlike Defender, you can only carry one human at a time) into a teleporter tube to get them off the planet entirely. The game is quite difficult, with some very precise flying required at times (probably even more difficult than Defender or Stargate). It also has more of a &amp;quot;plot&amp;quot; than the arcade games it is based on, with several sub-missions of rescue depending on what stage you are at (it should be noted that there is no breaks between &amp;quot;stages&amp;quot; - the whole game play is continuous).</resource>

Rescue on Fractalus is a good guide to what to expect - the action is first-person and depicted in 3D, with hovercrafts and aircraft among your potential targets. There are various game modes including air and ground combat of varying intensity levels, as well as 5 skill levels and full training modes, as well as ten set-piece scenarios.The tactical screen must be used to pick out troublesome sectors and launch advance attacks on them.</resource>

This game features Athena Asamiya, a descendant of Princess Athena, who uses her new psychic powers (hence the game's title, Psycho Soldier) to clear a post-apocalyptic world of its mutant inhabitants with the help of her friend Kensu, thus allowing simultaneous two players gameplay.

The gameplay consists of the usual run and jump fare typical of the genre with the added feature of a constantly scrolling background, which, added to the many &amp;quot;option&amp;quot;-style power-ups and Athena's own psychic blasts make the game a strange shooter/platformer hybrid.</resource>

Taking control of one or the other (Puffy is more powerful but Puffyn can move faster) you must find your way through.

Puffy's Saga is an overhead view maze game that represents a cutesy variant of Gauntlet. Each of the 20 levels has a quota of dots to eat before the level is completed. These levels are inhabited by foes who surround you and reduce your energy on contact. Meat restores 100 energy points each time - this total can go beyond its starting level of 500. You are armed with a gun, which not only kills foes but also turns many of them into edible energy-giving snacks.

Keys must be collected and used to open doors. Magic Goms allow you to use a map or a fire-bolt. Other available bonuses include invincibility periods and teleporting.</resource>

It is an adaptation of &amp;quot;Punch &amp; Judy&amp;quot;: you are the hunchback Bobby, your goal is to make your way across sixteen theater stages to rescue the beautiful Judy from the Punch. Each stage is filled with the typical hazards of a traditional play, like crocodiles, custard pies and rotten tomatoes, as well as the pits that must be crossed via moving platforms. You'll sometimes have the chance to catch a sausage flying around in the air as you move along.

Even though it is a rather early game, the Spectrum version features some interesting speech samples using a technique that was very uncommon at that time.</resource>

    <resource id="d85e2f875cd8a64a18b58e9fef4419c2a82ac2b5" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">The challenge in each level of Puzznic is to maneuvre a selection of blocks into place so as to clear them all, by making them make contact with blocks of the same design. You control a cross-hair, which can move a block left or right, which can cause it to fall if there is no block under the space it would occupy.

There are many complications in terms of solving the levels. Moving platforms meaning that you need to move a block at a particular time, or in particular order, to prevent them being blockaded. In some situations there are an odd number of a certain type of block - solving these requires positioning two of the blocks one space apart, such that a move will result in a piece making contact with 2 others, and immediately removing all 3. You will also encounter blocks positioned on platforms suspended in space and gaps in level arrangements meaning that a certain number of blocks must be in place to make a certain move possible (by forming a stack, for example)

The game structure is slightly unusual, as after you complete each batch of four levels you get a choice of 2 sets of levels - you are progressing through an expanding matrix of levels, which means there are 2 sets on level 2, 3 on level 3, 4 on level 4, and so on. This means that there are a total of 220 screens in the game. Each screen is played against a time limit, and losing a level (either by running out of time, or by making a poor move and leaving an impossible position) loses one of your 3 lives.</resource>

The goal is to change all of the tiles on a pyramid to the target color. To do this you guide Q*bert around the pyramid, and every tile he hops on will change color. On early levels, a single hop will change the tile to the desired color, but on later levels you may need to hop on a tile multiple times or even avoid hopping on a tile multiple times! Trying to stop Q*bert are many different creatures which wander around the board, including Coily the snake, Slick and Sam, and falling balls. On the edge of the board are floating discs; if Q*bert jumps on one of these discs when the snake is in pursuit, the snake will fall off  the board while Q*bert is safely transported to the top.</resource>

Drawing the rectangles using the &amp;quot;slow&amp;quot; method awards you the most points. Once a rectangle has been made, it will be colored in to show that you have claimed your territory. While drawing the rectangles, you need to watch out for Qix (pronounced &amp;quot;kicks&amp;quot;), a series of colored lines that crawl the screen. In addition to Qix, you also need to avoid the Sparks who travel around the border, as well as any lines that you have made, as well as The Fuse, who travels along the line that you are drawing.

    <resource id="2df777d4e2eb23dc58c5cf02ed0772a144fd189d" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">R-Type is a side scrolling shoot 'em up best known for its extremely tough and strategic gameplay.  You control the R-9 spaceship as it launches a last-ditch effort to repel the evil Bydo empire.

The R-9 comes equipped as standard with a small gun which can only take down the smallest of enemies without firing several shots. By holding down the fire button, it can be loaded up so as to release a large burst of energy, eliminating all but the strongest enemies in its path. From time to time, pods will come flying in your direction. Upon being shot, they release an upgrade. The first one will invariably be the one called &amp;quot;The Force&amp;quot;, which is a weapons pod that clings either to the front or the back of your ship, absorbing any enemy bullets or acting as a bumper with which you can fly head-on into them. You can also use it as an offensive weapon by firing it and pulling it back in. Mastering the Force is vital to surviving in R-Type, since it must be used both as protection against bullet clusters, as a remote controlled cannon, and in order to clear the screen from obstacles. Other upgrades give you target-seeking missiles or a bigger main gun. Different gun types, differentiated by their colour, serve different purposes. The blue one sends laser beams bouncing across the screen (good for tunnels), the red one fires straight ahead, and the yellow one follows any walls it may encounter (good for artillery emplacements).

The stages of R-Type are made in an organic style, certainly inspired by H. R. Giger's artwork for the Alien movies. When it came out, it was considered trend-setting since it broke off from the stereotypical sci-fi mould of other shoot'em'ups. In part, the levels themselves are your enemy, which is exemplified by the fourth, where spider-like creatures weave webs that cover the screen and block your path, or levels with intricate tunnel systems. Still, the levels are best handled with a combination of strategy and reflexes, without the memorisation that is required of R-Type's contemporary rival, Gradius.</resource>

R.B.I. Baseball 2 has One Player and Two Player options as well as a Password mode to enable you to play a full season (one game against every team in the division). In addition, a watch mode provides you with the best seat in the house for a computer-controlled match up.

R.B.I. Baseball 2 is similar to the original R.B.I. Baseball in terms of gameplay. This time around the game uses the teams and statistics from the 1989 season. Just as in the original, you get to see what it's like to step up to the plate as Ricky Henderson, pitch the ball like Nolan Ryan, and catch a line drive like Ozzie Smith.</resource>

The game combines both above and below water aspects. Above the water, you must manage the company, press conferences and finances. Below the water, you explore the Titanic and her many secrets by navigating T.S.1 (your underwater robot) through a maze-like environment while trying to find a way to raise the ship to the surface. You must find eight flotation bags in order to raise the vessel.

Along the way, you'll find several hidden items that combine to create yet another item, many of which are required to open locked doors, safes and other hidden compartments.</resource>

You control a rat, who must grab all the pieces of cheese in a maze, and flee from all the other rats.

There are red ones who chase after you, and black ones who are activated when you get close to them - both types kill you on contact. When they are close, you can activate a Star Screen to block them off.

The Radar of the title is on the right of the screen, and shows you where each piece of cheese is, although the actual maze is not illuminated, so your next snack might be further away than you think.</resource>

The game has the player controlling a helicopter which is on a mission to destroy everything that moves.

The main goal in each level is to destroy a factory, which requires a steady increasing amount of bombs. Enemy forces include ships, planes, tanks, anti-air guns, and eventually, a large battleship.</resource>

This is done in a multi-stage action game with some similarities to the same developer's Beach Head. All the mini-games must be completed before the time limit on the bomb is expired.

The first thing you will see is a missile being launched; the game then takes you to your hangar, from which you must quickly launch as many ships as possible, a task made difficult by the limited gravity. You must then fly it into Soviet airspace in a side-view shoot 'em up section, in which staying low keeps you safe from radars, and quick reactions see you shoot enemy fighters and avoid trees.

The next scene takes place on a single-screen view, with five windows to shoot through, and enemies aiming at you to be avoided. You then reach the base, and must shoot out approaching enemies. Finally, you must use discs onto a wall, such that they rebound to hit maintenance robots, with the ultimate goal of causing the base to overheat, the Soviet attack to be thwarted, and the US to be saved.</resource>

By trapping beasts under your rainbows, then jumping on them to break them you can collect seven different colored gems, and there are also power-ups for extra speed and rainbows.</resource>

    <resource id="95bab0da0fc26c0bec448f1f475e38dca9a5f64d" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">This game is about a baby owl tasked with coloring of the rainbow high above the clouds. The rainbow is organized as stripes of colors, which initially appear as different shades of gray. The stripes themselves are split into smaller squares. The owl navigates the playfield by jumping back, forward, left or right, one square at a time, coloring them in the process. 

Some squares are in fact gaping holes and jumping on those will send the owl tumbling down to his death. Trying to stop him from accomplishing the noble task are weird looking imps, birds and other critters that seem bent on devouring the little guy as they converge on him from all directions. The only way to escape the gruesome fate is clever avoidance. 

As the game progresses, not only does the shape of the rainbow become narrower and trickier, with more dead ends and pitfalls, but also the speed and number of the enemies increases. Every few stages a bonus round is offered, during which extra lives can be gained by quickly hopping on pieces of the rainbow appearing in random directions.

The game is presented in pseudo-3D perspective and features cosmetic day and night changes.</resource>

The physics of driving have been programmed very well for the possibilities at that time and the options for adjusting are diverse. But the special thing in this game is the two-player-mode. There is no split screen as in Pitstop II, but both racing cars are in the same screen. If a car now falls back so far - be it through a crash or slower driving - that the distance between the two racing cars is greater than the size of the screen, the race will be interrupted, the driver who had fallen back will get a penalty, both cars are set up next to each other again and the race is continued at the current points. Another interesting detail is, that you can force each other from the street. If the six tracks built into the game are not enough, one can design some more with the track editor and also save them on disk (24 tracks per disk).</resource>

Colonel Trautman has been kidnapped by the Soviets, and you've gone in there to rescuing him. Doing so is a three-part operation approximately following the plot of the film.

In the first part, you explore the building Trautman could be in, through a top-down view of the building. It is heavily protected by infra-red security beams, which when activated unleadsh the enemies. The locations of the beams are only apparent if you collect the special goggles. Other hazards include mines, trapdoors and booby-trapped doors, but there are enhanced weapons to collect.

Section two is identical to the first, except that it is located outside, the enemy are onto you from the start, and there are no traps. The final section changes to an Operation Wolf-style shoot 'em up, with a horde of tanks, foot soldiers and helicopters to face. Your gun can jam, which adds to the challenge of finally getting out alive.</resource>

The game is for one or two players simultaneously, and each has the opportunity to enter in a five-character name before play begins, which will subsequently be displayed next to individual scores during play. 

The game takes place on a single screen, where the player(s) can move left and right on one foreground plane, and the object is to destroy a castle, each phase, by scaling and punching the individual buildings until each, and all collapses. Buildings will often overlap, requiring some to be taken down before others. Players will be harassed by witches, goblins, archers and the like. 

The back story concerns two knights, Sir Griswold and Sir Larkin, who have had a curse set upon them to be transformed into giants by the Evil One, and they must quest for the fiend, so that they may be restored to mere mortals.</resource>

    <resource id="af992e66a688eb3d4a91829a00b0f433c58af859" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">The purpose of apprentice courses is for young people to learn a trade gradually, without putting yourself or your employers at risk. Unfortunately, nobody explained this to Wizard’s apprentice Mervyn, before he tried to cast a spell to make him irresistible to females, as the spell misfired, and made him attractive only to female frogs. However, his dungeon was soon invaded, and Mervyn was not killed, as he appeared to be a humble frog.

Viewed from above, the aim is to kill all 96 of the wizards who have invaded the dungeon, which is split into 8 levels, each made up of 16 screens and at least 50 rooms. To see what’s in a room he has to enter it, in a manner similar to the Switchblade games.

The game’s rather esoteric title comes from the way you obtain spells to upgrade the four different types of power you have (power, offence, defence and effect). When you meet a warlock you enter a mini game in which the letters RANARAMA are in random order, and by swapping pairs of letters in sequence you must form the full word in as little time as possible. This system of having a sub-game for collecting upgrades is similar to the ‘grappling’ concept in Paradroid.

This earns up to four of the Runes (Mysticism, Witchcraft, Magecraft and Runecraft), each of which can be used on one of the four types of power. The Magecraft offensive use is a fireball, defence for Runecraft makes you invisible to enemies, and the special effect for Witchcraft allows you to jump through space. Lose a life and you lose all these powers, and losing another life means it’s Game Over.</resource>

You control AL, the globular droid, in a revenge mission against the eight rebellious planets of the Ryvian system. Beware the electric spikes on the surface of the planet, avoid the evil aliens disguised as cuddly computer characters. Collect the laser weapons and bombs as they float past, otherwise you won't survive the hazardous conditions on the planet surface. Ransack is a high-speed arcade extravaganza that will test your skill and reactions to the limit!&amp;quot;

&amp;quot;We want revenge!&amp;quot; - that was the surprising decision of the Democratic Council of Planets, normally a friendly bunch of well-meaning but ineffectual representatives.

The Ryvian system of planets had refused to pay its share of the council budget, and then had the nerve to eat the council representative sent to negotiate with them! So, reluctantly, the council invoked the so-called 'Ransack' clause, which allowed them to punish defaulters. Unfortunately, due to the budget shortfall they could not afford to send a battle fleet, only a second-hand and somewhat battered &amp;quot;Al&amp;quot; (artificial lifeform - the words &amp;quot;Robot&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Droid&amp;quot; are regarded as discriminatory, and are no longer used).</resource>

The first job is to get the droid repaired, after which you must regain control of the power generator and the engines.

The game is controlled by moving MSB directly, with a teleport facility on the droid allowing you to move one object at a time. Spanner-type devices are mounted from the floor - guiding MSB into the top of these reveals puzzles which can be used to unlock doors to reach other sections of the ship. Before any power can be generated and the ship's scanner accessed, a leak must be fixed by finding and using a piece of spare piping.</resource>

These puzzles were originally reading-based challenges but different titles focus on other subject areas. Visually, the game consists of a series of static screens which the player can navigate through by clicking on certain &amp;quot;travel&amp;quot; hot-spots. Other hot-spots can trigger an interaction with a character, item, song or mini-game.</resource>

You control a Ghostbuster, who has 10 levels full of ghosts to clear up.

This is done by first shooting the ghosts using a gun, and then by using a photon beam (by holding down the fire button) to suck them in for storage in the backpack. Photon recharges can be collected, as can the potential for an improved shot, as well as a shield. The Ghostbusters mascot Slimer also appears as a power-up, which hovers around your character killing ghosts on contact.</resource>

Each dungeon comprises up to a dozen separate rooms, with the game moving from one to another when the player moves onto a number of defined door areas. The player had to navigate through the rooms to find the treasure, either a crown or a key that provided access to a formerly locked dungeon. They then had to retrace their steps to exit the dungeon. The rooms normally contained zombies, snakes, spiders and other various beasts. The game's enemies could not be killed, but were generally stupid, simply running directly at the player. Careful timing and positioning could trap them in locations where they could no longer reach you. The player could also drop crosses by pressing the joystick fire button. These acted as obstacles to the monsters, and were dropped in opportune locations to block pursuit. The player could drop up to a dozen of these in their wake and they would disappear slowly over time, allowing the pursuit to continue.</resource>

    <resource id="ab7d072df2050f23d28a50719ec6f1eca63478e1" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">You play the part of an agent of SAROS, the Terran resistance movement against their imperial alien overlords, the Arcadians. Disguised as a merchant, you will fly your ship, the Caydia, to three different colony planets -- Tropos, Halmuris, and Arcadion -- to rendezvous with underground freedom fighters and gather the intelligence you require to destroy the central computer of the Arcadian hivemind, liberating humanity!

An adaptation of Robin Waterfield's Fighting Fantasy gamebook #18, published the previous year, this computer game version rejects the Choose-Your-Own-Adventure gameplay design of the book in favour of a more open-ended text adventure model, albeit one with a restrictive text parser.  Most elements of the trademark Fighting Fantasy RPG system, including the randomness of even simulated die-rolls, have been streamlined out, leaving only metrics for damage taken and hunger (hitherto untracked in the books.)  Carrying limits, while atypical in FF gamebooks, are enforced here as in the original book.

A further new dynamic includes the strict timetable of the space traffic control towers -- you need to have wrapped up your business planetside before your launch window comes up, otherwise you're out of luck.  In keeping with the game's sci-fi setting (in both rural and urban flavours), you will find extensive use of objects such as your limcom, nutritious hcaps (tasty like dead Zorkons, num num!), and the indispensable lite-kube.  Combat has been largely phased out in favour of an extension of the gamebook's espionage theme of ciphers and passwords, magic words with the power of plot advancement.

A version of this game also came out for the BBC Micro.</resource>

    <resource id="006b3b5fa8713234c8ccbe451e3d66d8e4174cbe" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Red Heat is based on the Walter Hill film of the same name, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger and James Belushi. You take control of Soviet detective Ivan Danko (played by Schwarzenegger), who travels to Chicago in pursuit of the fearsome Georgian drug lord Victor Rosta.

The game is essentially a side-scrolling beat'em up in the vein of Vigilante. As Danko, you proceed across four levels which follow the movie's original setting, where you are constantly attacked by members of the Cleanheads, a group of drug-dealers who are in business with Victor Rosta. To eliminate hostiles you can either punch them (slow but long-ranged) or head-butt them (close-ranged but faster). The only defensive move available is crouching, so as to avoid being hit - there is no jumping or any other evasive tactics. Occasionally, you can get hold of a handgun and fire six shots at the villains. Other items you can pick up will boost your health, grant you access to bonus levels, or cause you to lose control of Danko for a few seconds.

One peculiarity of Red Heat is its widescreen-like game area, and the fact that all characters are drawn from the waist up. This may find partial explanation in the first level, set in a Russian sauna where, as in the original movie scene, all characters are not wearing clothes.</resource>

This crystal has been stolen and as a result, the land has fallen into chaos. A single powerful magician is sent to rescue the Crystal from the castle where it's hidden. 

Red Moon is an graphical interactive fiction game. Players assume the role of the wizard on his quest to recover the crystal. They will have the use of many weapons and a dozen magical spells. Combat is a key element of the game: both the magician and enemy opponents have hit points, in the style of RPGs. Spellcasting requires certain objects to be collected, and many spells must also be cast on a specific target. Various objects will be found during the adventure, including garlic, pills and a mask.</resource>

As you travel the city you must pay attention to your popularity ratings - you can play the game either to perform good or evil. 

The game uses a text parser with a vocabulary allowing for actions such as walking, looking around, arresting people, hitting them, using objects, or waiting in a set position for a set amount of time - every action sees time get used up. Standard input methods such as using AND or commas to delimit multiple commands, and leaving out words like THE and SOME are implemented.

Being in Redhawk mode uses up energy, so this must be used sparingly.The screen display is in comic book style, with the last 3 drawings on screen at each time.</resource>

There are a total of eight enemies on screen at any given time. The Quarriers try to build the enemy base by stealing parts of yours. The Drayns steal energy from you and then supply it to the enemy. Fortunately you can steal back the energy they take, but you can't steal back parts of your base. The other six enemies just try to kill you. The bigger the enemy base gets, the more rapidly and accurately they can launch enemies at you.</resource>

First, you are trying to get across the city, which is represented as a maze of houses, to where a building is on fire. Avoid contact with the houses or other vehicles. A timer counts down from 1000 to zero, representing your score - zero means you're out of time.

There is no fire truck at the building when you arrive, so you have to catch the people who are in the building from falling to their doom, while avoiding falling flower pots. When three flower pots have hit you, this round of the game ends and the fire truck arrives. The goal is therefore to build up as many points as possible by avoiding these pots.

After the fire truck comes, you can enter the blazing building to scour for survivors. You have to rescue everyone in the building before the fires in the building burn you to death. This is done by touching them to lead them, then moving to a window, without being hit by the fireballs.</resource>

Your mission is to rescue stranded pilots on the planet of Fractalus. You begin each mission from the mother ship, and when your quota of pilots has been rescued you must return there so you can move on to the next level. To help locate the pilots and navigate the tricky terrain, your spaceship is equipped with various instruments, such as a compass, altimeter, and scanner. Your enemy, the Jaggi's, have numerous forces on this planet and will be attempting to stop you. Gun emplacements, flying saucers, and the Jaggi themselves are all capable of destroying your ship if you don't destroy them first. To defend yourself from these threats, your ship is equipped with torpedoes. As the levels progress, the Jaggi defenses become more aggressive, and you will even need to fly some night missions where visibility is limited!</resource>

Not easy though - native plants and animals have adapted and fought back at the threat to their territory. A walled area now encloses the city, which is crumbling around you.

When Snowball 9 reaches the planet, Commander Kim Kimberley is filmed apparently committing a murder. As Kim, you must escape from the 'justice' of crazed robot droids. Snowball 9's landing is made dangerous due to the robots malfunctioning.

Return to Eden is an interactive fiction game which sets you as Kim, and challenges you to enter and survive within the robot city. Strange and surreal outcomes about - what do you get when you plant a brick? The world includes a bank, a theme park, the Corridors of Power, and a Starbike.

Unlike its predecessor, it features graphics, with over 200 illustrative pictures featured. adds the ability to type while the screen is updating. Vocabulary is simplified - a new IT command refers to the last-mentioned object, and clothing can be WEAR'ed without being GET'ted first.</resource>

However, his plane crashes in the middle of a bunch of crazed Coolus. Hopefully he's up to the challenge of escaping. If he is, he will find himself in the pyramid of Egypt with no easy way past leaders and their minions, and then engulfed in a web of traps in a Nazi base.

Rick Dangerous is a platform game across over 100 screens, in which Rick has his gun in one hand, and dynamite sticks in another. You must take a methodical approach to clearing each screen, as there are traps in place which will need memorizing and preempting where possible. Use the dynamite wisely, for enemies you can't get into the purely-horizontal range of your gun.</resource>

The journey takes in Hyde Park, Ice Caverns, Forest and Atomic Mines. He must solve positional puzzles and memorise the locations of laser bolts and booby traps, as well as avoiding enemies including robots, penguins and nomads. As in the first game, a fifth level is unlocked after you complete the four standard levels. Rick can climb ladders and crawl through tight spaces. He is equipped with a laser gun and six little bombs, but can also punch with some effect. The controls are very easy to understand: pressing fire+up shoots the gun, pressing fire+down places a bomb, pressing fire+bottom-left/bottom-right makes Rick slide a bomb along the floor in the specified direction.</resource>

Located in a medieval kingdom, the game puts the player in control of the former king's son. Unfortunately, an evil sorceress called Medusa has taken control of the country and is now dominating the people.

The prince's task is to find five magical rings that will give him the power to overthrow the sorceress and claim back his heritage. In the beginning the hero will try to earn money by doing trade between different towns, or try his luck at bounty hunting or at treasure hunts. Once enough money has been earned to maintain a larger army, the prince will send forth his men to search for the rings which are in the possession of large soldier of fortune armies rallying the lands.

Sometimes the player takes part in small arcade sequences like sword fighting and sea fights, or controls an army on the battle field.</resource>

The plane is armed with a cannon with unlimited ammo. It can be used to destroy the enemy vehicles and bridges, but a careless player can accidentally destroy a fuel station. Colliding with the riverbanks or with the enemy aircraft destroys your plane and makes you lose a life.</resource>

The goal is to reach the finish line in one piece throughout each of 50 levels. Numerous enemies are out on the road to try and stop you, including armored cars, motorcycles, canons on the side of the road, landmines, and more. 

Your vehicle is equipped with a machine gun to help you out, and occasionally a weapons plane will fly in and drop additional power ups that can be collected. Some of these are the U.Z. canon, cruise missiles, and speed boost. Your car has a very limited amount of fuel, however more can be picked up along the way by crossing the halfway point of a level, or by collecting the red and green fuel spheres that appear in the road or after destroying certain enemies.  On many levels collecting fuel is critical otherwise you won't be able to reach the finish line.</resource>

You play the Road Runner. You must run along the road, avoiding trucks, landmines, falling rocks, etc. and also not get caught by Wile E. Coyote. You must also eat birdseed along the way or you will become faint and Wile E. will catch you.

You can get points for eating birdseed and making Wile E. get hit by trucks, falling rocks, etc.

The Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum versions are one player only. The Atari 2600 version is one or two player, alternating. The Atari 2600 version also has another difference in that you don't HAVE to eat the birdseed but you can for the points. This may have been due to programming constraints on the Atari 2600.</resource>

Coyote (and inevitably cause him to fall into a trap) are recreated in this action game. You control Road Runner himself in two distinct stages, each of which are repeated four times with increasing difficulty.

In the first Road Runner must peck as much seed from the ground of a single screen as he can, while avoiding the myriad traps and dangers Wile E. Coyote throws at him from the sky. The more seed you can peck, the better your chances will be in take 2.  This involves running away from Wile E, jumping the traps he has laid and finally reaching the safety of a big drop, which you will clear and watch Wile E. fall through, just like the cartoons.</resource>

The computer takes the role of the Russian Army. The game covers the whole of the Eastern Front from Finland to the Crimea with East at the top of the screen so you have to move your Army upwards. There are 10 skill levels (0 - 9) and you can play a whole campaign starting in 1941 or play four individual campaigns which are 1941 - Invasion, 1942 - 2nd Offensive, 1943 - Russian Offensive and 1944 - Battle for Poland. Each campaign lasts a year and you have two movements a month. 

The idea is to move your units to other parts of the map, once you are happy with your choices the computer calculates how far the units would have moved taking in account of the weather and terrain. Any enemy units in the way will fight the other unit until they are defeated, surrender or retreat. Things to consider when moving is not to move too far from your supply lines as these will make your units useless. The terrain and weather play a big factor as well as attacks from the Russians. Try to complete your campaigns before the Russian winter set in and the Russians built up overwhelming forces. 

The aim of the full campaign is to make the Russians surrender Moscow, Stalingrad, Leningrad and everything West of them. The game is viewed on a small part of the map from above with the units shown as icons.</resource>

All of a sudden, a fatal epidemic emerged throughout all of the U.S.A. and spread by some occult and fanatic sect. The epidemic spread over the land in only several months, causing the government to collapse. Anarchy is now everywhere. You are a leader of a street gang and your immediate objective is to acquire as much food and fuel as possible to strengthen your position as a leader of the city. But you and your warriors are not alone; there are other gangs in the city, and they need food and fuel, too. And they want your food and fuel. You must fight against them to defend yourself and to win new loot. As you rise in power as a gang leader, you will be able to totally control several cities. Remember though, your ultimate goal is to find and bring together the eight scientists; only with them can you have a future and survive. Unlike other typical strategy games, you don't have to read a big manual to be capable of playing this game. The game has great depth, and I liked the atmosphere. If you know and like the ?Mad Max? movies, then Roadwar 2000 is definitely something for you.</resource>

If you encounter any ghosts, they will move you to another part of the tomb but the Mummies and snakes need avoiding or a knife thrown at them to kill them. Before the quest you can select your skill level (1-10) and if you want the Mummies to move about the tomb. On certain skill levels you can decide how many knives to carry, and how many Mummies and perils you want in the tomb.</resource>

First you select your team off 11 based on their battling, bowling and wicket-keeping abilities. A coin toss decides who bats first, after which you choose your tactics for the upcoming over, based on weather and wicket conditions. The bowling side has 9 field layouts to choose from.

The action is represented from a top-down view of the whole field, with a running commentary as to the results of each stroke, showing what type of shot was played, who fielded the ball, and how many runs were scored.</resource>

characters as ancient as the very forest. It was indeed the 'Shaft of power' of the Saxon
nation, symbol of freedom and peace, more precious than the crown of the kingdom itself
to the Saxons. Yet it was with this arrow as bait that the Sheriff planned to capture this
mysterious 'Robin of the Wood'. He well knew of the importance of the Silver Arrow to
the peasants of his domain, indeed to offer it as a prize, as though it were a mere trinket or
bauble, appealed to him as a prime insult to the serfs, and worthwhile simply for that
reason. It was when he realised that such a prize, whilst meaningless to himself, would be
certain to attract Robin to the contest, that he finally decided. There was to be a great
archery contest - the prize was to be the Silver Arrow - and for the Sheriff, the main
prize was to be the death or capture of Robin.
On the day of the contest the woods were swarming with Norman soldiers the Sheriffs
men. They had orders to shoot on sight, and shoot to kill.

The major corporation there, Omni Consumer Products (OCP) saw an opportunity to sell a new kind of law enforcement officer to the troubled city. They took what was left of Murphy, encased it in titanium armor, wiped his memory and created RoboCop. Now it's up to RoboCop to clean the streets of Detroit and eliminate the one responsible for his murder, Clarence Boddicker. But it looks like Clarence might not be the kingpin of this town...

Based on the 1987 movie of the same name, RoboCop allows the player to control RoboCop. The majority of the game is a side scroller. RoboCop can punch unarmed citizens and shoot armed citizens. He can move left, right and duck but can not jump. Different weapons can be picked up from enemies, and power-ups to restore health and/or energy.

    <resource id="672820bd9d1fbdc5d28b3e218d700ab64ff0d7b0" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">In this text adventure based on Isaac Asimov's science fiction detective novel The Robots of Dawn, the player takes the role of Earth detective Elijah Baley, who is sent to the Spacer world of Aurora to investigate the murder of Dr. Han Falstofe, a prominent roboticist and constructor of humaniform robots. Suspects include Falstofe's political and professional rival Dr. Kelden Amadiro, his surrogate daughter Gladia, his biological daughter Vasilia, or ladies' man Gremionis, who was rejected by Gladia. Even Baley's robot friend and partner, R. Daneel Olivaw is not free of suspicion. In addition to the investigation, Baley must also deal with his fear of open spaces on Aurora, a result of having spent his entire life in enclosed spaces on the overcrowded Earth. Also, most Aurorans will not exactly be willing to help Baley due to anti-Earth sentiment.

As typical with adventure games in the detective genre, puzzles are less based on item manipulation but more on gathering evidence and questioning suspects. In each game played, the murderer might be a different one - the location of items and people's reaction to questions differ accordingly. To convict the killer, Baley must determine motive, means and opportunity and present his evidence to the Chairman of Aurora.</resource>

The moves on offer include almost everything you'd find in real wrestling (and I don't mean WWE) - piledrivers, arm twists, body slams and turnbuckle flies, all of which are fully animated. The whole experience includes detailed multi-colour graphics and a full rock soundtrack.</resource>

Four different teams participate in the contest: Houston, Tokyo, Moscow and Madrid. Each team consists of five players on skates and a ball is shot into an arena from right to left and the idea is to pick the ball up and shoot it into an opening in the wall on the right. If the ball touches the left wall then the game is restarted and the ball fired into the arena again. Each match lasts 10 mins and the team with the most goals win. The ball can only be picked up and if touched knocks the player off his feet and the player with the ball can be tackled by the opposition players.

Rocket Ball is viewed from the side at an elevated angle with part of the length of the arena shown and will scroll right to left with the position of the ball. One or two players can play and have the choice of four teams. If playing the computer you can select from one of six skill levels. Players can only go left and can't move to the right but can speed up or slow down. Moving the player is controlled by the joystick and while holding down the fire button and pressing down will pick the ball up, while pressing up will knock down a player.</resource>

There are 40 screens to clear, all full of baddies, who are disposed of by grabbing them with a stick, and flipping them from side to side to inflict damage. The hits needn't all be inflicted at the same time, as it's possible to release them to move them out of the way.

When killed, each bad guy releases some kind of extra, ranging from points bonuses to various devices which can be used to kill other enemies.

Each level also contains a certain amount of fruit. If you can collect all of this (with some bad guys still alive - you move on immediately once they're gone) you enter a bonus game, in which each enemy's death results in one of the letters E,X,T,R and A being released - collect them all for an invaluable extra life.

In the Game Boy version the difficulty lies slightly lower because the player can use his wand even when climbing ladders.</resource>

    <resource id="f8bff239ff5e7a3c9b7f802e625f3a08fa7950bf" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">In Rollaround you roll around (surprise) 20 levels, in a game which comes across as a more cerebral version of Marble Madness. The twenty levels each feature 9 screens worth of squares, with no scrolling across them as such. On each level you are set a target number of crosses of each colour  to collect, with less and less leeway as to how many of the different ones are required as the game goes on.

There are pre-programmed moving enemies on each level to plan around, but the level's blocks vary in many ways. There are holes on the levels, but these can be jumped by pressing fire. You can turn plain squares into either crosses or holes, both of which invert the status of the crosses and holes respectively as well. Mystery squares (whose effect can be good or bad) and clock squares (which stop the timing and slow the aliens) are also present.</resource>

The player must trek through seven levels inhabited by mutated super-intelligent animals in order to diffuse each nuclear reactor.

Gameplay is a Gryzor style flip-screen run'n'gun shooter (with occasional jetpack flights), with fairly unrelenting action. Power-ups are issued by a canister which the player will have to control in order to gain the weapon they want. The difficulty level is pitched high, as with Project X which was released at a similar time.</resource>

    <resource id="7c89dc25acd409b4a32489911722f4cbb0ff69aa" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">In this intergalactic 3D action-flight-simulation your mission is to save the Rubicon, an constructed anti-matter zone that was made by the alliance of the eight planets of the Hyturian system. In 2746 after many centuries of war between the eight planets of the system, they decided to build up this anti-matter zone around the entire system as protection against each others. It worked fine for several decades - the peace remained unthreatened. But now the time has come that the Rubicon barrier has been breached, by the entry of a new planet and its hostile home race, the Space Thugs. Enter your Starfox fighter, save the whole system, and find out who breached the system.

The action is viewed from the cockpit of your starfighter, which is equipped with lasers and side/rear-view mirrors. It also has a status log detailing your weapons and current threats, and an advanced 3-dimensional navigation system called the Holocube. Controlled from a separate screen, the Holocube allows you to rotate a 3D image of space and plot the co-ordinates of your journey. 

The player must manually navigate through wormholes for fast travel - contact with the edges drains your shield. Electrical and ion storms are a constant hazard - the easiest way to avoid these is to use the general log to note their co-ordinates. Weapons can be upgraded

Starfox features eight missions to be completed in order. The first is to shoot down 60 Space Thugs.</resource>

The search starts on the surface of the planet, but also takes Ruff underground into the cavernous regions the Lilli-Punies live in. These have lots of water, which Ruff must avoid. Plenty of extra lives can be collected along the way, with solving puzzles as important as good reactions and dexterity.</resource>

    <resource id="93f7ed5afbfa25d1ac19eda53458dc0f4c71ee56" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Depending on which title you use, and how you interpret it, this game is about a guy who a) rushes in before attacking b) attacks Russians (this was the mid-80s, when the US helped bin Laden do the same), or c) wears a rather goofy hat. One way or another, this arcade game arms you with a knife and sends you on a kamikaze mission against hordes of enemy fighters. There are four distinct sections of gameplay, taking in a Missile Base, a Harbour, a Bridge, and an enemy Prison Camp. Extra weapons with limited ammunition can be collected along the way, which will make the task a lot easier. The level is divided into 3 horizontal levels, which can be moved between either by jumping or using ladders, and this gives a chance to avoid the more threatening mobs of enemy fighters.</resource>

Such is his power that no living creature dares to cross paths with him. But the legendary warrior Rygar rises from his grave to restore peace and justice. Armed with his famed weapon Diskarmor, Rygar begins to traverse the vast lands that lead to the lair of the demon, as his minions are trying in vain to stop him...

Originally released on the arcades, Rygar is a side-scrolling action game. The player controls the titular hero, advancing through stages populated by hostile creatures. Beside the Diskarmor, a weapon that looks like a shield with a chain attached to it, the hero can use a variety of other weapons, including projectiles that can be fired in four directions. Various &amp;quot;powers&amp;quot; are scattered through the levels and can be collected. The effects of these powers include increasing the fire power of the equipped weapon, adding time to the clock, temporary invisibility, extra points, etc.</resource>

It puts you in control of a satellite which must ensure that the wave of bombs aimed for the United States do not hit. Direction of motion and direction of fire are controlled independently - on the 16-bit versions you rotate the mouse left and right to direct the targeting, move it up and down to increase the range, and use the joystick to move the satellite and thus avoid any contact.

Each level is split into defensive and offensive stages. On defensive levels you must stop each unit as it heads towards the earth, a lá Missile Command. Offensive stages follow the old 'shoot it before it becomes a danger' philosophy, being free-flying shoot 'em up sections among a network of destructible (but worth saving) platforms.</resource>

One player controlled a helicopter and the other a jeep, with the jeep transforming into a boat when the vehicles passed over water. As well as a host of blaster fodder the game also included a mid-level enemy inspired by the &amp;quot;Goose&amp;quot; enemy from the earlier title Silkworm. Pieces of this enemy would fly onto the screen and assemble into one vehicle before commencing to fire at the players' vehicles. When destroyed the &amp;quot;goose&amp;quot; would drop power-ups.</resource>

You are capable of all manner of ninja-style moves including kicks and punches, as well as using weaponry. You must travel through an underground complex linked mainly by platforms and ladders, before triggering a bomb and escaping the complex. Your energy recharges if you stay still, so finding areas free of guards (kill these for money) and dogs (avoid them; killing them gains you nothing) is useful, especially as you only have one life. There's plenty of object manipulation involved, although only one item can ever be carried at a time.</resource>

The screen is divided in two, with one third at the top of the screen showing a bird's eye panoramic view of the surroundings and your plane, and the two thirds at the bottom showing the actual battlefield. The scrolling speed is controlled by the player, as the scrolling slows down when the plane nears the left side of the screen, and picks up speed as the plane moves towards the middle. Sanxion does not feature any end-bosses or power-ups, instead the player is treated to a non-lethal bonus stage after each completed level, where the aim is to shoot, collect or avoid obstacles in a race against time.</resource>

    <resource id="b33ba6923b6b09596850f86f1d980bcf690f8a10" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">A combination puzzle/action game from Datasoft.  In each of the 100 levels, the player moves a crusader through an obstacle filled maze trying to reach the Saracen Chief and detonate a bomb next to him.  The chief does not move, instead remaining in a set position.

Along the way, he must avoid roaming guards, bouncing cannonballs, and other traps.  The crusader is armed with a bow and can pick up directionally specific arrows that are used to stop guards or destroy walls. The arrows being limited to shooting in one of the four compass directions is exacerbated by only being able to carry one object (key, arrow or bomb) at a time. For these reasons, the game's puzzle leanings and the need for a methodical approach are strong.

There is generally only one way to solve each level and proper use of the given tools is key to finding it.</resource>

Each of the 40 levels consist of rows and piles of tiles, patterned with symbols such as butterflies and masks. Pair them up within the time limit to move on a level. The difficulty is that a tile can only be moved if it has no tile on top of it, and a gap either to the left or right (or both). Careful planning ahead is required if all tiles are to be cleared.</resource>

    <resource id="c55224aa5343ccbb438d11845634f3b128a8b14d" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">The original SARGON was written by Dan and Kathleen 'Kathe' Spracklen in a Z80-based computer called Wavemate Jupiter III using assembly language through TDL Macro Assembler. The name was originally written entirely in capitals because early computer operating systems such as CP/M did not support lower-case file names. SARGON was introduced at the 1978 West Coast Computer Faire where it won the first computer chess tournament held strictly for microcomputers, with a score of 5-0. This success encouraged the authors to seek financial income by selling the program directly to customers. Since magnetic media were not widely available at the time, the authors placed an advert in Byte Magazine and mailed $15 photocopied listings that would work in any Z80-based microcomputer. Availability of the source code allowed porting to other machines. For example, the March?April 1979 issue of Recreational Computing describes a project that converted Sargon to an 8080 program by using macros. Later the Spracklens were contacted by Hayden Books and a book was published. The Spracklens made significant improvements on the original program and released Sargon II. In 1978 it tied for third at the ninth North American Computer Chess Championship despite being seeded ninth of 12 entries. Sargon finished only behind Belle and Chess 4.7, and defeated AWIT?running on a $5 million Amdahl mainframe?amazing the audience. That year they published a series of articles in BYTE on computer chess programming, stating &amp;quot;we think it would be nice if not everyone had to reinvent the wheel&amp;quot;. Sargon II was ported to a variety of personal computers popular in the early 1980s. The game engine featured multiple levels of lookahead to make it more accessible to beginning chess players. BYTE in 1980 estimated that Sargon II had a 1500 rating at the highest tournament-time difficulty level, and speculated that it was the best chess program on sale, including dedicated devices.</resource>

Contact with the enemies en route (which are mostly mutant demons) drains your limited energy, and you are also working against a time limit on each section. As well as your magical powers (which are stronger in part two), you can collect swords to attack, as well as lightning bolts which can be collected to destroy all enemies on screen. In part two vanquished foes release coins, which can be spent at shop sections on rechargers, shields and teleporters amongst other things.</resource>

Once the bridge is completed, the player can cross it to face Satan. Destroying him scores bonus points based on the number of waves completed to that point, and also upgrades the rocket launcher. The player then resumes the battle against the gargoyles and must start building a new, longer bridge in order to fight Satan again. The sky darkens on later waves, making it harder to see the enemies. As the game progresses, the gargoyles begin to throw exploding eggs, along with rocks that can destroy bridge sections; the player also occasionally faces disembodied devil heads that float around the screen and spit fire. In addition to firing rockets at the enemies, the player can use a shield that will destroy any enemy touching it. However, this shield can only be used for a short time before it must shut down to recharge. Gargoyles will sometimes attempt to steal a ship from the player's reserve lives, similar to Galaga.</resource>

To face and destroy the Mothership you must get 150 points before the aliens get 50 points. Blasting the saucers get you various points while for every three seconds on screen and destroying a landmark, an alien gets points. If the aliens get 50 points or manage to land then it is game over. You start the game in the daytime and the game moves into the evening and then night time for every 50 points. Once you have got 150 points then you can face the Mothership in space and this entails trying to shoot it's Command Module on the top but you can decrease it's shield hitting elsewhere on the ship.

You can play all three, but to get more than one life on levels 2 or 3, you must first input the code earned on completing the previous level.

You play Savage, a muscular warrior who was imprisoned in a castle. When he broke free, he found out that his imprisonment had been a trick with the sole purpose of imprisoning his love, the maiden. You have to progress through the 3 parts of the game to rescue her. 

The first is a simple horizontal-scrolling shooter, in which you use the trajectory of your shots to kill enemies and collect the treasures and improved weapons they drop when killed. The second is a 1st person perspective 3D shooter resembling Space Harrier, with skulls to shoot and monoliths to avoid. In the third you play Savage's Eagle form, flying through platform-style levels avoiding timing-based hazards and shooting anyone who gets in your way. In this section bubbles can be shot to release power-ups</resource>

Du bist ein Held des 1. Grades mit mittelmäßigen bis schlechten Werten. Diese werden zu Anfang des Abenteuers zufällig ermittelt. Deine Aufgabe ist es, ein Heilkraut für den todkranken König zu finden. Dabei musst du dich vielen Gegnern stellen und diverse Entscheidungen treffen. Zum Teil musst du auch Prüfungen mit deinen Eigenschaften (Intelligenz, Charme, Geschicklichkeit und Stärke) bestehen. Auf dem Weg zum Heilkraut muss du an einer listigen Hexe vorbei. Auch sind deine Fachkenntnisse hinsichtlich eines Waldschrats gefragt. Hier kann dir das Handbuch aus dem Spiel Die Dunkle Dimension weiterhelfen.

Folge Nr. 2: Der unheimliche Tempel

Die zweite Folge spielt in einem anderen Teil der Welt und zwar in einer Wüste. Du kannst den Helden der ersten Folge nachladen und damit das Abenteuer beginnen. Deine Aufgabe ist es in einen Tempel Wasser zu finden, um das Überleben der Karawane zu sichern. Bereits am Eingang des Tempels ist eine Rätzel zu lösen. Um zu den großen Saal zu gelangen, wo anscheinend eine Wasserquelle ist, musst du viele Räume durchqueren. Dort lauern bissige Ratten und riesige Schaben auf den Abenteurer. Endlich im großen Saal angelangt ist noch ein großes Rätzel zu lösen. Hilfreich dabei können Kenntnisse über Götter der Antike sein ...</resource>

Scramble 64 a side scrolling shooter. Piloting a plane through varied (and mountainous) terrain, your goal is to infiltrate an enemy base and destroy it. Missiles, tanks, UFO's, and other enemy artillery can all be found and will try to stop you. Colliding with any of these enemies, enemy fire, or the landscape will cause you to lose one of your planes. To fight back, your plane is equipped with both bombs and guns which can destroy most of the enemies you'll encounter. Your plane has a limited amount of fuel, and you'll crash if you run out. To replenish the fuel supply, you must bomb the fuel depots which will appear on the ground occasionally.

It takes place on a grid loaded with pieces of an Amulate, all of which must be collected. When you collect one, an arrow appears preventing you from moving back in that direction; failure to obey the Wizard sees him release a beast, which must be avoided.

You are the player in this forced 3D world. As well as Amulate pieces, there are also scrolls to collect - these produce spells which can be activated by typing the name. Spells include freezing the enemies, a level skip and a smart bomb. Other than the bomb, each one lasts for 20 seconds. 

Power Disks are activated once a screen is clear, and take you to the next one. Other hazardous creatures to avoid include the Kitz and the Nim, who kill you on contact.</resource>

This game is a sequel to the game Subsunk. The previous game saw the player, in the role of Ed Lions, aboard a submarine that had been sunk by enemy powers. The task there was to send a message back to base requesting help.

This game picks up from that point. The enemy have intercepted the message and, using a mysterious magnetic force, have taken the submarine to their underwater base. The player, again in the role of Ed Lions, starts the game in a walkway to the base. Beside him is a dead body and a briefcase. Ed must explore the base and find a way to escape.</resource>

You have two types of torpedoes: one that fires to the right and one that fires up. You have a limited number of torpedoes and fuel units, so when you are running low be sure to watch for the green supply ship to release the dolphin that brings you fresh supplies. The enemies are varied and numerous. Enemy submarines pursue you below the water, and enemy destroyers on the surface can drop depth charges that slowly sink to the bottom and are deadly to the touch. You must also watch out for your own torpedoes, because there are certain ships on the surface that are immune to your fire and reflect your torpedoes back down at you. You can control your submarine with either joystick or keyboard.</resource>

It might sound like an odd idea for a computer game, but Level 9 felt that there was an adventure in there. Most of the major characters from the book appear, including Adrian's warring parents and their respective flings, his sweetheart Pandora, his best mate Nigel, school bully Barry Kent, and curmudgeonly pensioner Bert Baxter. The game didn't use many typed commands. You would read passages of text (many of them from the book) and be given 3 choices as to what to do, which would lead to other events unfolding. You could also use a help option which would display information about characters featured in the diary. Your aim throughout all of this was to make Adrian as popular as possible. The player's score and ranking is displayed at particular times during the game. The percentage achieved relates to the rank, with 26% being 'a spotty creep' and 38% 'a middling thicko' for example.</resource>

If the answer is yes then the game Security Alert is for you. The game allows you to get into five buildings which include a jewelery store, a museum, a bank, a research building and an embassy. Each building is more secure and bigger than the last. You need to find loot but the main aim is to find a certain treasure.

There are many security systems in each building including cameras, robots and infa red beams. You have tools to do the job with as well as collecting tools on the way. Every time you are seen the alert goes up but lay low and the alert goes down. Don't lay low too long as there is a time limit. Get caught and it's game over.</resource>

The game stars Seymour in a grim city in the future. Here he must clear 30 levels of many villains and a boss each. Every level is a maze viewed from above. Once all villains in a stage have been arrested the boss is automatically destroyed.

Weapons available to Seymour are his bionic stretching arm or his 'cuff gun. Keeping the fire button held down makes the arm extend more and the cuffs more potent. As each villain is arrested they release bonuses for extra points. Other bonuses to collect and use are a telephone to call the SWAT team, a blue light that protects Seymour for one hit and a rainbow tile that gives extra speed. Collect the letters ROBOTCOP and this moves Seymour onto a bonus stage. Be wary though of apples and cans thrown at you and steer clear of any bombs.</resource>

At the beginning of each level, three enemy snakes will also enter the maze. To complete the level, you need to eat all of the enemy snakes. If an enemy snake has more segments than your snake, you can only eat segments that form the tail of the snake; a collision with the head is lethal! Each time you eat a segment, the enemy snake will become smaller until eventually you can devour it completely. For enemy snakes that have fewer segments than you, you can eat the tail segments or the head segment. From time to time, a frog will appear in the maze; eating this will cause your snake to grow. Both your snake and enemy snakes will leave eggs behind occasionally; left alone, these will hatch (your eggs earn you an extra life, enemy eggs will hatch another snake). Eggs can also be eaten to remove them from the playfield, so it's usually a good idea to eat enemy eggs before a new snake hatches! The maze changes for each level, and the enemy snakes progressively become larger and tougher to catch.</resource>

As the player establishes forts and missions, bringing back gold to Spain, he or she would receive promotions from the Queen of Spain. 

The game features a large world to explore and comes up with some arcade sequences to simulate the interaction of the Natives and Spanish who did not speak the same language. The historical map accurately spreads out the Native population of the New World in 1492 and some historical situations can be simulated, such as whether to get the gold of the Aztec and Incas by trade or conquest.</resource>

As he arrives in his limousine, he soon discovers that the Dirk, the studio manager, has disappeared in Miami. Seymour must start production of his film by himself.

Seymour Goes To Hollywood is a platform adventure, another Dizzy clone, this time replacing the egg character with an amorphous blob of unknown origin. Like in the Dizzy games, the main objective is to collect everything that isn't nailed down (using the fire button) to solve puzzles. In the upper left portion of the screen sits an inventory with three slots and besides that the score points and the energy bar. Seymour loses energy when touching dangerous objects and hazardous environments. When the bar gets empty, Seymour transforms into a pile of bones and the player loses one life. The game starts with three lives (shown as clack boards under the energy bar) and no way of saving progress.</resource>

Players take the role of Kevin, who is trying to rescue his friends from their jail cells. As prisoners are released, they will attempt to follow Kevin, and also attack nearby enemies. Kevin's goal is to lead each prisoner to the exit, and onto the next level. Some levels have hidden passages which lead to bonus/secret levels.

As with any Gauntlet-style game, finding enough keys to deal with each door is crucial.  Kevin can pick up weapons such as grenades and boomerangs,  and other enhancing objects such as faster movement, a smart-bomb diamond, and other bonus objects for points.</resource>

It is a beat'em up in the veins of Double Dragon featuring Ryu Hayabusa, a ninja who must fight members of an evil cult who seek to fulfil Nostradamus' end of the world prophecies.

Ryu Hayabusa can attack his enemies using his his bare hands and feet or using a sword (for a limited time). He can also perform moves such as a flying neck throw, a back flip and hang kicks, performed while hanging in scenario objects. Throwing enemies against objects such as phone cabins, oil drums or dumpsters will destroy them, revealing power ups such as health items and swords. At some points, Ryu will have to perform acrobatic moves to carry on. He has a life bar starting with 5 units.

The game takes place in United States' locations such as Las Vegas, North Carolina, Los Angeles, the Grand Canyon and Brooklyn. The enemies in those stages are mostly of the same 5 kinds, including Jason Vorhees' look-alikes and other masked men. There is a boss fight at the end of each stage.

A two-player co-operative game is also featured. Whenever the player dies, a continue screen will appear showing Ryu chained to a table while a circular saw descends upon him.</resource>

He grew up on drugs made to destroy his own will and turn him into the Beast Messenger, a powerful creature serving Maletoth, The Beast Lord himself. He did his job, until one day he noticed a man about to be sacrificed in a ritual, his face triggering ancient memories... and as the sacrificial knife descended into the man's body, Aarbron recognizes the face. Of his father.
As his father dies in the altar, memories of his childhood and tormented past at the hands of the Beast Lord emerged, and as feelings of hate over his captors took over him, he swore revenge and fled the temple, knowing the road to avenge his father and redemption would be hard.

Shadow of the Beast, one of Psygnosis most popular titles during the 16-bit computer era is a side-scrolling platformer best known for the use of parallax scrolling along lush graphics, a musical score  by David Whittaker, a iconic cover by Roger Dean and what many consider to be unforgiving gameplay, balancing between the &amp;quot;very challenging&amp;quot; and the &amp;quot;impossible&amp;quot;. The player has to navigate through several areas filled with enemies and traps, collecting keys and activating triggers than open new areas or give Aarbron the means to overcome a sub-boss. The number of moves the player has at disposal is limited: duck, jump and only two attacks: punch and a flying kick. While most enemies die with just one hit, the player must time each attack accurately. However, there are also traps of objects that cannot be destroyed, and these require the player to jump, duck or move according the sequence. The player has only one life with 12 hit points that can be replenished by collecting some objects hidden in the level (like an off-route location or a under a megalith), which also contributes to the difficulty level.</resource>

Plans for a new type of spaceship are hidden in a micro-disc embedded in the Ambassador's spine. If Zoff had the plans, the empire would be in great danger, and it is only a matter of time until his inquisitors will discover them. The Emperor has assembled the so-called &amp;quot;enigma team&amp;quot;, a group of six reckless mercenaries, to take care of the situation.

Players take control of all six mercenaries and have one hour and forty minutes to rescue Ambassador Kryxix and capture General Zoff. All six characters have different abilities. Syylk is an insectoid and a strong fighter, Zark Montor, the team leader, is an expert in unarmed combat and the only translator of the group, Servina Maris is the only character who can pick locks, Torik is an avian with thorough knowledge of explosives, Maul is a slow combat droid and Manto is a weak droid, but the only team member that can operate the transporter that is vital for the mission's success.

Controls are completely icon based and the screen is divided into six sections. The upper screen section is called the mission command screen and displays which character is active, the active character's location and the status of all characters: whether they are moving, engaged in combat, weak or dying or performing certain action such as picking locks. The lower half of the screen changes depending on the situation and shows additional information and all selectable actions.

From the main game screen (enigma team screen) players can choose one of the six characters and access four sub-screens:

Character status screen:
Shows a character's speed, strength, stamina (health) and carried weight.

Object screen:
Shows all objects present at a location as well as all objects carried by the selected character. It can be used to drop or pick up items, equip weapons and items or use special items.

Movement screen:
Here, the active character can be moved by clicking on arrows that show possible directions for a character to move.

Battle screen:
During battles, characters can scan the location to count and identify their enemies, move, attack with their equipped weapon, defend or retreat.</resource>

A tile can only be removed if it has no tile next to it on at least one side. This computer implementation can generate a random board layout to take on and features five preset challenges, some of which have time limits of five or ten minutes, as well as a multiplayer mode.</resource>

You play Lee, who has become trapped in the Temple by the Triads, and must escape by over-powering them. Each section of the game is on several levels (which you can jump up and down) and scrolls. Balls of energy are sometimes released when you kill a Triad - grab this and it becomes a powerful weapon you can hurl at an opponent. Most enemies can be killed with standard kicks, but each level has a Super Triad who can only be killed through magic.</resource>

Reaching the end of each level will find you battling it out with a boss. These range from 8ft giants to helicopter gunships.</resource>

Now the player has to set things right by using the central controls inside the station - but of course it is not that easy. He first have to solve three levels with different gameplay mechanics:

The first is a diagonally scrolling shooter which plays very basic: don't getting hit by the mines which come in formations of three. It is best to shoot them, however, because surviving mines may come back from the side, which is deadly. After reaching the station, the game becomes a Pac-Man variant. In a maze-like field the player needs to pick up glowing balls on the floor without being touched by the enemies. But there are two important differences: the player controls a tank, i.e. he can shoot the foes, and he doesn't have to pick up all balls. If he got enough, he can simply use the exit. However, a few balls can't be picked up and the pattern needs to be remembered</resource>

For a long while after Pearl Harbor, you are the only forces capable of striking back at the Japanese in the Pacific. Take one of the &amp;quot;fleet boats&amp;quot; and go on extended patrols of up to 2 months from Hawaii, Australia, or New Zealand. Set your difficulty/realism level and time period (early means less tech for juicier targets, later means tougher escorts, more tech, lousier targets). Contend with factors like dud torpedoes, maximum depth, and more. 

You can choose among practice run against some old hulks, recreate historical convoy attacks, go on a single patrol, or go on your own campaign, which lets you go multiple patrols until you die, get promoted, or survive the war.

These had previously been released for some but not all of these systems.

Silicon Dreams can be played as three separate games, but to obtain the maximum number of points, you must complete them in order (carrying your score from one adventure to the next). Snowball has graphics for the first time, and the other two games have more graphics than before, and some longer text descriptions are added to all 3 games.

Snowball: As Kim Kimberley, your mission is to safeguard the colonization ship Snowball 9 and its passengers. When you are awakened prematurely from hibernation, you know something's wrong!

Return to Eden: Your objective is to get into the new city of Enoch, and stop the Eden robots from destroying Snowball 9.

Worm in Paradise: You have to find as much information about the city as possible, obtain money, and then become a member of the governing party of Eden.</resource>

The main difference between this game and many other side-scrolling shoot-em-ups is that you got to be on land as well as in the air.

Player 1 would play as a helicopter, but if a second player joined the game, they would play as a jeep. Both players would have to protect each other as well as themselves. After a certain number of kills, a &amp;quot;goose&amp;quot; helicopter would form on the screen. If the players managed to destroy it they would get a weapons powerup. This would go on throughout the entire game (a &amp;quot;goose&amp;quot; could appear even during the end of level baddie!).</resource>

The first task is to place essentials such as housing, transport links, schools, factories and shops. There are 50 types of these, allowing for homes of all standards and different types of businesses. Make sure to consider which sites are effective for which tasks. Some power sources pollute, others don't but are more expensive. Taxes must be raised to ensure an income, and then portions allocated to public services such as policing and roads. Earthquakes, floods and fires are all emergency situations that must be dealt to contain any damage.

Successful mayoring will cause the small village to grow into a town, then a city and finally a metropolis. As the city's size grows so do it's needs. Commercial buildings may suddenly find that they need an airport to expand trade, or housing may find itself changing rapidly as vast amounts of people come and leave.

The game also includes 8 pre-defined time-limited scenarios, with specific challenges and targets. The environment varies in each game (especially if you have the Terrain Editor add on), and this should affect your choices.</resource>

The player grooves his way around one level of the car park which has been turned into a multidirectionally scrolling arena for the gladiators of roller racing. Kick cans over, litter to collect and obstacles to avoid in the shape of cones, ramps, sand, bouncing balls, flying frisbees, mazes of tyres and rocks, and even other skaters. Finishing each level is a battle against time to negotiate a series of gates in a set order, the next gate being signified by a row of dots which flash between its flags. 

To complete rounds successfully, though, suitably impressive stunts and tricks are carried out to appease a set of four judges. Each have a card which they periodically display at the bottom of the screen, notifying the player of his progress. When the player's energetic jumping skills have gained enough points to qualify, he skates through the finishing gate and has his performance rated. Failing to qualify forces the player to skate around the car park against the clock, picking up a set number of pieces of litter. Beating a level allows the player to skate to the level's exit ramp, from where he chooses to move up to the next level or leave the car park and move onto the next part of the game, 'The Skate Crazy Championship Course'. 

This section of the game is a race against time over four horizontally scrolling cityscapes of platforms and ramps, with the player building up speed on his skates using a paced joystick waggling movement. Ground level obstacles and gaps in the floor are crossed with leaps of controllable strength and items at head height are avoided by judicious ducking. Birds and other creatures also spell doom for the heroic skater, unless he is able to avoid them or throw things at them. 

Points are scored in this section by picking up extra skating paraphernalia, such as pads, clothes, skates and litter.</resource>

    <resource id="78bd15852a524481a1587a8b931005b8e02f6fe3" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Skate Ball is a futuristic sports game in which two teams try to score goals by putting a puck into the opponent's goal. Just like ice hockey, the team members skate on ice and use a hockey stick. However, the active team only consists of two members: a field athlete and a goalkeeper. The player controls the field athlete and tries to score goals or tackling the enemy when in defense.

As with many futuristic sports games, a match can be hazardous to the athletes. Not only are rude actions like flying kicks allowed, but the playing field is filled with obstacles like pits or disintegrators. Stepping on those causes the athlete to die and the need to use one of the two substitute athletes. Those have different stats (strength, reaction, shooting and balance) which influence the match - if there are enough alive, the player can choose the used athlete at the start of the match. The scrolling screen keeps on the puck and a radar helps to navigate the obstacles off-screen.</resource>

You skate around a menu room to choose which one to attempt. Before taking off you can visit Rodney's skate shop to buy equipment.

The first event is freestyle, in which your aim is to score as many points as possible in 10 attempts. Judges determine how much style and skill you have shown. The High Jump uses the same equipment, only this time your task is to jump as high as possible at the end of the ramp.

The downhill events are overhead-view races. In the Downhill Race you simply try to complete the course within 90 seconds. In the Downhill Jam you try to outperform a human or computer opponent whilst dodging or jumping hazards. You can use attacking moves to either remove hazards or knock your opponent over. 

The pool joust is more of a one-on-one beat em up using a stick, set within a pit to skate around.</resource>

In this unique, memorable and fiendishly difficult game, the player is a schoolboy named Eric, with the objective of stealing his report card out of the staff room safe by accomplishing various tasks around the school. The computer controls all the other characters in the game, including the headmaster, other teachers and pupils.

The four teachers are Mr Wacker (the headmaster), Mr Rockitt (the science teacher), Mr Withit (the geography teacher) and Mr Creak (the history master). Other than Eric, three of the pupils are named: Boy Wander (the tearaway), Angelface (the bully) and Einstein (the swot). The player has the option of renaming the characters before the game begins. There are also many unnamed, undistinguished pupils at the school.

If Eric is caught out of class or otherwise misbehaving, teachers pursue him and issue lines. When 10,000 lines or more are accumulated, the game ends with Eric's expulsion. However, Eric can also receive lines for things that are not his fault, such as lying or sitting on the floor when in fact he has been knocked down, or being nearest a teacher who has just been hit by a projectile fired by one of the other pupils.</resource>

Moving left or right allows you to avoid the obstacles such as trees, accelerating and decelerating changes the speed, and shooting keeps you alive. Harvester is a boss, which appears after certain number of enemies will be eliminated, and it should be destroyed.

    <resource id="937885f8941ae8c0aac1bd93ab4b9888098de03f" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Skyfox II is a space combat shooter, with many different missions and detailed bitmap graphics that was advanced for its time. The gameplay is fast, fun, and surprisingly varied. You will pilot a starfighter on a variety of missions, from locating lost artifacts to destroying the enemy. The enemy ships, Xenomorph fighters in particular, are a far cry from dummy ships of most early shooters: they will dodge your fire, gang up on you, and are deadly accurate with their attack.
Skyfox II also features some simulation and strategy elements, you can plan your attack, set a course on the overview map, and use autopilot mode. You also have to refuel once in a while, and this naturally puts you in a vulnerable position as enemy ships are always around.
Overall, Skyfox II is perfect for fans of space simulations who want some arcade fun, and arcade fans who want something a bit more complex than Space Invaders.</resource>

Don't get the champagne out yet though, because his evil power lives on until his name (which, as with all the Drunes, is a closely-guarded secret) is said. The only person who knows it is his daughter, who is trapped in Small Sky Tower. This, coupled with the fact that she's reputedly beautiful, is all the incentive Slaine needs to track her down.

The game system is unusual - known as REFLEX, it is menu-based, but these menus appear and disappear in real-time, meaning that the game has a constant aspect of pressure and time-sensitivity. You must collect and examine objects, map your way through Lyonesse, and use your mighty sword where needed. Slaine must keep an eye on his Warp rating, which drops in unsuccessful combat but is replenished either by physical (eating food) or mental (the high of winning a battle, or having a run of time without one) factors, and has a big effect on his performance.</resource>

    <resource id="31c5a79bafbe9ca500bd028a4cedff58d784fcd6" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Slam-Dunk is a two on two basketball game. Play against the computer or against another player. The game is divided into 4 quarters of three minutes each. The team with the highest score at the end of the final quarter wins. An overtime session can occur if the game ends in a tie. 

The game provides a practice session. Here you can learn the moves and plays needed to beat your opponent.

You control one of your players on your team. Your teammate will be controlled by the computer, based on your movements of the controllable player. On offense, you control the man with the ball. On defense, you control the man guarding the ball. On defense, you can switch your controllable player by moving the joystick right while pressing the button. 

In this fast paced game, fouling can occur if defense plays too close or offense shoves its way into a defensive man. After five fouls, free throws will be shot. If you're shooting free throws, simply hit the button to take the shot. Made free throws count as one point.

Keep an eye on the shot clock. Don't get caught holding the ball. Remember that any shot taken and made outside the three-point line is worth three points.</resource>

    <resource id="8fe7ddcf331b48f03f2a435909fe3105ddf2337d" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">The big and nasty Americana monster has come along and eaten up Mastertronic's pinball table where the Slamball family resides, a living clan of ball bearings with a happy deposition. The pinball table is inside the monster's stomach and the balls are in a bit of trouble. The pinball table is still operational, and since the monster's stomach knows that the family is still inside, it has decided to eject them one by one. The hole at the bottom of the table, which normally recovers the ball, instead slides down into the monster's digestive tract. 

Luckily for you, as a member of the secret society of prevention of cruelty to pinballs, have gained radio remote control of the table, and you must now stop at nothing to prevent any of the Slamball family from getting into the Americana Monster's digestive tract.

The whole game revolves around a vertically scrolling window of four screens that form the entire length of the table. As you launch the ball, you need to decide on the power at which the ball is ejected into the playfield. Four sets of flippers are positioned throughout the table; with the left and right flippers being controlled by pushing left or right on the joystick, respectively. 

All the elements of a real pinball table, such as bumpers and rollbacks, are included here. Even a nudge is implemented in times of extreme danger. Hitting nudge causes the whole table to wobble, and nudge is useful when a member of the Slamball family is in danger of entering the digestive tract. If the nudge gets overused, then the flippers are disabled until the ball reaches the Monster's alimentary canal.

Around the table are a number of enzymes which are held in groups of up to four. If a slamball comes into contact with these enzymes, the enzymes themselves disappear, and when an entire group is destroyed, a blob appears. If a slamball destroys this blob before it destroys itself by hitting the table's walls, the score multiplier is increased. If all the enzymes are destroyed, the level is complete and a bonus for any balls left is awarded.</resource>

We're introduced to Lee from the dog's perspective after waking up to find his owner sleepwalking through his bedroom window. Ralph leaps after him and the player then takes control of what happens next. Throughout the game Lee will relentlessly walk in the direction he is facing, the problem is there are objects and pitfalls in his path that can ultimately wake him up or even kill him. The player can monitor Lee's sleep level with a bar at the top of the screen. If the bar reaches zero, Lee wakes up and the player loses a life. If this happens three (or five depending on settings) times the game is lost. The player controls Ralph the dog in order to manipulate either Lee, or the objects he is likely to walk into, to see him safely to the end of a level. The frequency of these pitfalls increases as each level progresses and, as it does, the player has to spend more time strategically neutralising threats, far in advance of Lee's actual position in the level. Although it is possible for Lee to die, resulting in a loss of life and restart of the level for the player, Ralph is invincible, surviving otherwise fatal incidents with comedic effect. If all the levels are successfully completed Lee finally returns to his bed and crawls back in.</resource>

In Slightly Magic you are cast as Slightly - mischievous nephew of legendary wizard Bigwiz, who has suddenly taken off on some urgent business, leaving his castle in disarray with dragons and magical spells running amok. One of the dragons kidnaps the princess, and now Slightly has to save her.

In addition to standard inventory puzzles of Dizzy games, Slightly Magic introduces a magic system that requires multiple objects to be combined in order to achieve effects ranging from frightening the enemies to turning the player into a fish.</resource>

    <resource id="87344caf0b5c863507bd3514c889d005d72606ed" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">In this early UK-developed baseball simulation, one or two player matches can be played over 3,6 or 9 innings, with 3 different computer skill levels. The rules are explained by some introductory screens, and the game is fully faithful to these. Gameplay is in an arcade/action style, so you don't need to worry about statistics for different teams or players. 

The main viewing area is a forced-perspective view of the field, with a small side-viewed window of the pitcher's delivery itself. When fielding, control automatically goes to the player nearest to the ball, but a point doesn't end until the pitcher has the ball back (unless it is a home run). Features include stealing bases, pitching curve balls, or customizing the colors of each team.

The game has been presented with considerable glitz, with cheerleaders on screen between innings and lots of advertising boards and other slogans.</resource>

Later, a secret agent working for the American secret service and known only by the name of Sly, is informed that the terrorists that struck at the presidential ceremony were located, identified, did match their rap sheet and are confirmed to actually be C.W.D.

    <resource id="8b9645ec99a6d66b8afafc796068b549f9c94006" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">The year is 1999. The world's most popular television show is Smash T.V., an ultra-violent contest between two armed-to-the-teeth combatants, set loose in a series of deadly arenas that are filled to bursting with hordes of mindless beasts and killer robots. The aim of the game is to blast everything in sight and try to grab more cash and prizes than the other guy. Toaster ovens, VCRs, fancy cars and luxury holidays are there for the taking... for anyone who can survive long enough to enjoy them.

Smash T.V. is an insane shoot-em-up from the brain of Eugene Jarvis, creator of Robotron: 2084. It retains that game's frantic style of play and two-joystick control method, but adds plenty of gore, violence, a hint of satire and that all-important two player mode.</resource>

Whoever passes it will find a valuable item at the end - and of course the protagonist wants to grab it. The player takes control of a boat with the one and only goal to find the correct teleporter to the next level. The boat has the ability to jump over holes and use a gun to shoot at robots which try to harm it. These robots come in multiple variants with different behaviour. Progress is made more difficult by switch puzzles and special tiles, like ones which prevent the ship from turning around. Power ups like a level skip or extra lives can be picked up inside the levels, but they disappear after a short time. However, the picked up symbols don't get activated before finishing the current level. When the ship turns around, the whole level flips around it.</resource>

The player is in control of the Snoball battle tractor, a tank-like vehicle that can be moved up and down along the left edge of the screen. Like in any Breakout game, the objective of each of the game's 16 levels is to clear all bricks by hitting them with a bouncing ball but here there are also numerous enemies that fly from the right towards Snoball. These have to be shot down or dodged since any contact will lead to a life being lost. Missing the ball also leads to a life being lost and the player has five lives in total.

In addition to the enemies the player can shoot bonuses that aid the player and anti-bonuses that hinder the player. Bonuses include extra points, slower missile speed, auto rebound, shields, extra lives and level skip while anti-bonuses include minus points, slow fire rate, enemy attack wave, life lost and restart of level.</resource>

Using the SnoopNet computer, players will comb the streets of the neighborhood looking for clues, and investigating people's houses while they're away. Speed is of the essence, as if your Snooper Troop is caught when the owner of the house returns home, you could be thrown off the case for good!

The title encourages players to keep facts on people, map the neighborhood, review clues, receive special messages, and ultimately, find enough information to accuse and convict the criminal trying to chase the Kim family out their home.</resource>

You can take out a bank loan, the level of which depends on your division.

The team's formation can be customised, and as outfield players are not limited to a single position, you can customise the team's strengths and weaknesses in quite a precise way. Matches are played out by listing scorers as they happen, and are followed by a full list of the division's other results. Finances change after each match to to wages, gate receipts, and possible incidents such as riots and illegal player approaches.</resource>

On the soccer-themed levels, a 'goal' is guarded by 'defenders' who must be removed by hitting them. Score three goals to reach the next level - initially you will face another soccer-based table with more defenders. Other football-themed elements include 'throw-in' positions from the side and pop-up players to toggle for points. 

On the Amiga version, the later tables have a casino and gambling as a theme. Gameplay is fundamentally the same - hit the correct targets in sequence to advance, with other targets adding to your score.</resource>

It is set in a warehouse. On each level, the player must push crates (from square to square) to get them onto designated spots; once each crate is on a marked spot, the level is complete. Crates can only be pushed one at a time (so two crates next to each other cannot be pushed together), and cannot be pulled--so it's possible to get a crate stuck in a corner, where it cannot be retrieved! By the last levels, you must plan 40 steps in advance.</resource>

When all of the cells in a matrix have been collected, you move on to the next round. Each matrix is guarded by two sentinels trying to stop you. The sentinels wander around the perimeter of the matrix, and will shoot fireballs at your spaceship which can destroy it. You are unarmed, so your only defense against the fireballs is to avoid them. To help you out a bit, your ship is capable of flying at two different speeds. Each round begins with a 'skip-a-rack' timer; if you collect all solar cells before this timer runs out, you will earn bonus points and skip ahead a level. The game ends when you have lost all of your space ships.</resource>

He travels through the Ebbedown Forest initially, with gameplay similar to Ghosts and Goblins. 

The journey is largely from left to right, although downward movements through gaps and upward movements on rotating platforms are also frequent. Some drops can be fatal, but mostly those which have a platform in close reach, so these are avoidable and not purely random. There are many magic teleports en route, and the high trees narrow the journey. Extra lives (via collecting 8 crystals) and improved weaponry are on offer throughout your quest.</resource>

It was later released for the IBM PC. The game was created by noted game designer Sid Meier, and published by MicroProse Software, which Meier founded in 1982 with Bill Stealey. The mission of the game is to fly solo over several states, delivering bags of mail. The game supported a fairly realistic flight model (for the time), and a large number of flight instruments were available. A map covering many states of the US was used, which even included altitude data (although the landscape always appeared flat due to the technology constraints of the time).</resource>

At the start of the game you have two options, whether to fly the plane for practise or fly the plane for a mail run. You have the choice of six American states to fly over (instead of three in the original) which are Kansas, Washington, Colorado, Michigan, Massachusetts or Texas, each having their own weather and terrain. The games viewpoint is a 3rd person perspective behind the plane again with the joystick and keyboard to control your plane. The game also included speech to help you in flying by giving instructions as you fly.

In Mail Run you have been given the task of delivering the mail from your home runway to either one other airport or various airports. There are four difficulty levels (Student, Private, Senior or Command). Before your flight you must re-fuel your plane taking note of the weight of the plane and you can decide how many airports you wish to fly to. 

In practise flying you have 4 levels of difficulty (Clear, Landing, Contest or IFR). Clear allows you to fly in good weather, Landing is practising landing, Contest gives you a score for your landings and IFR is flying in low level clouds with zero visibility so you can only rely on your instrument panel. You also can fly in the day or at night.

The actual flying part has you sat on a runway and using the keyboard and joystick you take off into the sky and using the joystick control the plane. A map can be brought up to make sure your in the right direction. Once you have reached another airport you are able to land.</resource>

On each level your goal is to retrieve a key which can then be used to unlock the exit. To help out, you have a magic wand which can be used to create and destroy blocks (though some blocks can't be destroyed). In order to reach the key you will need carefully to arrange the blocks on the screen so you can jump your way around safely. Wandering around each level are a variety of enemies which will cause you to lose a life if you're caught. Some creatures can be killed by destroying the block they are standing on, others must be dodged. Hidden bonuses and magic can be found on many of the levels, sometimes even hidden in blocks. Some treasures give you bonus points, others can form magic spells to help deal with the enemies. To make the game more difficult, each level has a time limit in which it must be completed.</resource>

This platformer is the first game featuring the characters and they have got themselves into some problems.

 Matthew has gone out and left Sooty in charge of the house. Problem is that Sweep has left all his old bones all over the house and left the door to the garden open so that all kinds of bugs have gotten in. The game simply involves collecting all of the bones while avoiding the creepy crawlies that are occupying the house.


The player can choose to play as either Sooty or Sweep and they differ in the weapon they use. Sooty uses a magic wand while Sweep uses a water pistol. They both have the same effect on the enemies though, stunning them for a few seconds so that the player can move past. Different items can be picked up. Keys are needed to unlock doors, sticky buns can be used to attract the bugs, magic boxes recharges the wand while water bottles refill the water pistol. There is also a two player mode where Sooty and Sweep compete in getting the largest score. This is done by snatching each others bones and by throwing custard pies.</resource>

Until now, the success of past explorations was causing the space effort to grow by leaps and bounds. Until now, the explorers had found little more than fungus and small insects as alternative
lifeforms. Until now, the chief dangers had been 
those posed by the hostile environment of space. Until now, the aliens had not known about THEM.

On the ragged edge of the galaxy, other creatures that roam the stars discover humans and spaceships to be excellent sources of food and other resources. Prepared at the worst for clashes with rival exploration teams, the human crews can do little to
defend themselves as wave upon wave of nightmare
creatures descend upon their ships and bases.

In response to their distress calls, the Federation has assembled a series of rescue teams, lead by their best military sharpshooters, to deal with the alien menace. As the leader of one of these teams, you must gun down the intruders and pick up the human survivors. Brave the maze of dark corridors that may lead to a deadly shootout between you and legions of monsters. Pick up survivors and extra ammo on the way.</resource>

This combined with the many flashing gaudy colors the game throws at you leads me to believe that it was born out of a bad acid trip.

There are 13 stages to complete by jetting around and blasting bad guys and bosses as they approach. The game is played from behind the main character and the landscape rushes up in 3D similar to the effect used in many car games such as Outrun.

The game uses many of the enemies and bosses from the first Space Harrier, but adds an array of new ones as well.</resource>

The game takes place in the sky, which scrolls freely in eight directions, without any restrictions or obstacles whatsoever. The player controls a fighter airplane, which is capable of flying in any direction. The enemies also take the form of various aircraft, and fly in various directions. On each level, the player's task is to destroy a certain number of enemy aircraft, after which a &amp;quot;boss&amp;quot; enemy appears. Destroying this enemy advances the game onto the next level. There are five levels, set in various years: 1919, 1940, 1970, 1984 and 2001. On the first, second, and fourth levels, the enemies are various types of airplanes. On the third level they are helicopters and on the fifth level they are UFOs.</resource>

Inside the arcade are Token machines, jukeboxes, telephones, movie booths, popcorn machines, and so on. The token machines need to be restocked with money from the cash register when they are out of tokens, but eventually, the register must be replenished with cash from the safe. You must drop the tokens in one of your two storage bins. When you have stored at least ten tokens, the movie booth opens, and you can go inside to proceed to the next level. You are also awarded one bag of money, but if you store more than ten tokens, then more than one bag of money is awarded for each extra token collected. If nine bags of money are obtained, you proceed to the next level.

But the Zerks, two aliens that run around the screen, can steal tokens either from the machines or from the storage bins. Sometimes, a Zerk will toss a token to the other nearest the &amp;quot;piggy bank&amp;quot;. You must touch them in order to get the token back, before they throw it in their piggy bank. Alternatively, you can throw a token into the jukebox, telephone, popcorn machine, etc. and the Zerks will get distracted from their goal, giving you enough time to continue filling the storage bins. If the Zerks insert five tokens in the piggy bank, the game is over.

Between levels, an intermission plays, which are similar to those in Pac-Man. Later in the game, you have the ability to access these intermissions. As you proceed through the levels, the game gets quite difficult.</resource>

There are five different routes, offroad, north, east, west, south. The offroad course loops around back to the start, the others are long runs with a distinct beginning and ending. You must complete each leg before the time runs out.

Along the way you can pick up all kinds of bonuses. The colored flags are 30 points each, collect all colors in the order as indicated at the top of the screen to get 1000 bonus points. There are several gates the give you 100, 250 or 500 points, and a time gate. Drive through a time gate to collect it, you receive two seconds extra time upon completing a leg. Occasionally there will be a soccer ball on the road, hit it and it will fly away and you get 2000 points. 

There are bridges and tunnels, be careful not to fall off the bridge into the water or crash into the tunnel wall. There also are obstacles like boulders, logs and fences. If you hit them it will cost you valuable seconds off your leg time. But if you hit a log or small stone just right, the buggy will ride on two wheels until you hit something again.</resource>

    <resource id="dd718bc0aa0bbfab79f537246a3ec1c975c743e9" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">It's the 21st century in America. Technology has improved by leaps and bounds, and now (most) people live in peace. But in a small town somewhere, a vicious terrorist group known as Zapper is terrorizing small towns and kidnapping innocent people so that they can build a secret weapon. And, as it turns out, the family and friends of someone code-named &amp;quot;Super Joe&amp;quot; just so happened to be one of the innocents caught! Now Super Joe's hungry for revenge. Can Super Joe and his armored car destroy the Zapper organization and save his town from utter destruction in time?

The Speed Rumbler is a action game where the player races against the clock in an armored car piloted by Super Joe, destroying other cars and saving captives along the way. Super Joe's car is armed with a gun that he can use to shoot down enemy cars, but the enemy cars have a few tricks up their sleeve, so Super Joe should always be on guard. As the player progresses through the game's six stages, Super Joe can be given a boost by saving captives, who then award him with bonus points, increased fire power, or speed-ups. If Super Joe's car is destroyed, he can continue the fight on foot with his rifle. But unfortunately, Super Joe is not as powerful as his car - one hit and he's history.

Super Joe has 24 &amp;quot;hours&amp;quot; to destroy Zapper. The game is over when Super Joe runs out of lives or time - or if he successfully completes his mission.

The ball must be thrown into the goal at your opponent's end. Any amount of physical contact can be made, and there are no illegal ways to get the ball or the goal.

Before each match you can bribe the referee into awarding you a head-start or strengthening the abilities of your players. You compete in a simple knockout cup tournament, or in individual 2-player games.</resource>

As their manager, it is your job to transform their fortunes. As well as the league system, which consists of 2 8-team divisions and challenges you to advance to the top, there are also 2 cup tournaments, one of which is played out over 2 'legs' with the aggregate score deciding who progresses. You can play the matches as well, which is the real meat of the game. They consist of 2 90-second periods, and the gameplay is futuristic, fast and frantic, with heavy tackling encouraged to retrieve the ball. Power-ups and tokens appear on the pitch, including ones to make your players extra-tough or freeze the opponents.</resource>

The protagonist Drinn has to retrieve the &amp;quot;First Element&amp;quot; from a dangerous castle.

The game is an isometric action game with puzzle elements.The player commands Drinn through the castle rooms (which scroll as long as no door is entered) and solve puzzles by using the correct items or spells. Spells are limited, though, and have to be found in the castle rooms. To dispatch of the numerous foes he uses either fireball spells or his sword for direct combat. If an enemy launches an successful attack on Drinn or touches him, the life energy drains an if it reaches zero, the protagonist dies. Spells and commands have to be chosen with the keyboard and then triggered with the joystick.

Besides special spells for puzzles and fireball there are two other standard spells available: find it (shows the location of hidden chests) and tell tale (gives a hint how to proceed). If a critical spell is wasted or Drinn dies the game has to be restarted from the beginning.</resource>

The game invented a whole new control system, essentially pioneering the use of icons and windows in adventure games. You control a pointing finger, which can be moved onto each of the menus to reveal sub-menus, which contain the main options for object manipulation. 

All objects can be examined in detail, which produces a visual display of them, and possible clues as to their usage. You must look after your character's health and energy levels - carrying too many objects will progressively weaken him. You must also look after and direct the trapped characters once you locate them.</resource>

Our hero must guide a ball through a level to the spot marked 'In', by creating and removing blocks to alter its path. The game is prevented from being a pure clone due to the ball, which moves automatically once activated, and can be controlled by using strategically-placed blocks.

Simply reaching the ball usually involves modifying the level layout using these bricks. There are enemies moving on fixed paths which must be avoided, and bonus items to collect. Also watch for bonuses such as invincibility, gravity-alteration and teleporting. You take time to rotate, so the controls aren't truly immediate. The ball takes 20 seconds to start moving, so use this time to plan ahead.</resource>

This game is primarily a platforming game in which Spider-Man fights against various enemies. Those can be stunned with Spider-Man's iconic web substance, but touching them or other hazards in the game world will decrease his health. Another important part of the gameplay are puzzles, mostly with the goal to deactivate some of Mysterio's gimmicks, e.g. changed gravity, to clear the path. Spider-Man can climb walls and shoot grappling hooks.</resource>

    <resource id="5637ec1bef1dbcb157114f1306195c3e80d8076a" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Spike's Peak is an action game where you need to climb to the top of a mountain! Gameplay takes place on five different screens. The first screen shows you approaching the mountain; you begin here each time you start a game or lose a life. All you need to do is walk up the path to begin the stage you've reached so far. Flags by the path indicate how many lives you have left. The next screen is a zig zag path through meadows at the base of the mountain. Beware of the deadly bears and eagles here! Along the path are several caves which you can hide in when a bear or eagle appears (you can also jump over bears). The caves are cold, however, and you have a limited amount of time to hide before freezing to death. Make it to the top of the path, and you begin the next screen. Here you climb up a rocky ledge. Boulders and falling pieces of rock constantly appear and can knock you back down the screen. Next is the icy cap of the mountain. Climb up to the top without being knocked down by avalanches or getting caught by the abominable snowman. The last screen takes place at the mountain summit where you need to climb to the top and plant a flag before freezing! Complete all of these screens and you win the game. There are four different difficulty levels available.</resource>

He ends up in Transilvania, which seems to be just an ordinary village. However, he finds out that his shipmates have been captured, and are being imprisoned in the dungeons of the local castle. Spike must rescue his friends from the mysterious castle, but first he has to escape from the (apparently friendly) villager's house where he finds himself, as the door won't open.

The game is a mix of puzzles and action. The action involves you dodging various enemies, such as dogs, ghosts, bats, etc, and avoiding the many traps in the dungeons of the castle.

You only have a limited amount of energy, and if you lose all of it by touching enemies or traps, you lose a life. If you lose all your lives you lose the game.</resource>

The game is viewed isometrically, which means that the controls are rotated through 90 degrees - this, coupled with the fact that many screens have huge gaps and diagonal paths, means that it's hard to get far at first. Falling off ledges loses you time, which is very limited to start with

Gerald must collect energy crystals throughout his journey - which can also be shortened by using a complex system of lifts. Sections you have travelled through are automatically mapped.</resource>

    <resource id="278e8e4416adff938aeb48de8911caa400b05688" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">In October 1983 author John Worsley hid 40 diamond talismans and one larger 'The Great Wight Eye' all over the Isle of Wight. After they were all hidden he released a book which contained clues to the locations of the diamonds. These could be found by anyone who read the book and any diamonds found allowed the finder to receive royalties in the books sales. 

Commodore released a game based on the book and the idea of treasure hunting in 1984. The story concerned a cabin boy called Mark who sailed with smugglers in 1763 but after landing on the Isle of Wight, they are ambushed by the Revenue Service for the 40 diamonds and the large talisman the smugglers had. In the confusion Mark managed to flee with the diamonds but was caught and killed. His spirit realising the evil in these diamonds he scattered them over the island. Over the years people have travelled far and wide to the island but are unable to unravel it's secrets.

You are a treasure Hunter and you have arrived on the island to search for the diamonds. You start your adventure on the actual island with a part of the island shown from above at an elevated angle. The screen scrolls as you move around looking for the 21 buildings that contain the diamonds. As you walk around there are many dead spirits roaming the island and if you touch one then part of your PSI bar decreases. If the bar is empty then it is game over. 

Any building you come across you can enter. The game now turns into a platform game with the whole level shown on the screen. You must avoid the spirits once again as you attempt to retrieve the diamonds placed on various platforms. Falling from a height will also lose you PSI energy. Any diamonds collected increases your PSI but will also reveal a letter at the top of the screen as well as the occasional rune. Once all diamonds are collected you will reveal a message and the secret meaning of the runes for 'The Great Wight Eye'.</resource>

    <resource id="0bffed0835722152ca78154ea6ef24d8d8c56b66" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">This flight simulation sets you as a young Spitfire pilot in 1940, when World War 2 is hotting up in the skies over the south of England. The program is viewed from within the cockpit, with the instrument panel viewed by pressing Space. The pilot will have to co-ordinate landing gear, brakes and ruddering, and use a map to navigate and find targets. Loops, rolls and split-S moves are all incorporated in the simulation logic.

The game can generate random combat situations - for example, 6 enemies 10 miles away, 1500 feet into the air. Once you have established a strong flight record you can take on the missions. Additionally there are practice modes for both flying and combat.</resource>

The basic premise involves being presented with 1 of 10 pictures (representing famous figures such as Ronald Reagan, Maggie Thatcher, Lady Diana and even Sir Clive Sinclair), with the complete picture presented at the side of the screen. You must move your cursor onto the, pick up a piece, and place it onto the main playing area, ensuring that you can move the others into place. Unlike with the plastic versions there are 16 pieces to fit into 20 spaces, allowing more leeway in terms of continual sliding. The complications in this version include gaps in the playing area which swallow pieces and return them to the bank, a time limit, bombs which have to be moved off the screen to avoid losing a life, and bonus objects to be moved in specific ways for bonus points.</resource>

Your car is equipped with machine guns to help you get past the numerous enemies out on the road (be careful not to shoot any civilians, though!) Occasionally you will come across a weapons van, and if you drive into the back of the van your car becomes equipped with a second weapon (such as smoke screen, oil slick, or missiles.) At several points the road splits and you can enter a boathouse which transforms your car into a boat temporarily. If you drive far enough the seasons change as well (watch out for icy conditions during winter!) The enemy cars will do anything to stop you, including running you off the road, firing guns from the back of a limmo, or dropping bombs from a helicopter.</resource>

There are a few pitfalls to avoid such as quicksand and sharks. There are also new traps (hidden pits, napalm, snares and a pistol) and hand-to-hand combat is done with swords instead of clubs.</resource>

Spy's Demise is an action game written by Alan Zeldin for the Apple II, published by Penguin Software in 1982 . It was ported to the Atari, Commodore 64, Texas Instruments TI-99/4A, and Vector-06c. The game contained a puzzle which could be solved for a Spy's Demise T-Shirt. According to Antic magazine in June 1984, only four people had solved it.</resource>

The gameplay is essentially the same - groups of 3 variably-colored blocks fall towards the bottom of a 6x18 grid, and you must arrange them into groups of 3 of the same colour - except that the blocks are grouped horizontally rather than vertically.

Each individual brick falls as far as it can when you place the trio, so they won't necessarily all end up on the same line. Blocks fall as far as possible to fill gaps when lines are completed, so there are never gaps in the arrangement the way you get in Tetris. Each level sets you a target number of lines to form - 4 or 5 in a row count as 2 and 3 lines respectively for this calculation, a lá Klax. Horizontal lines score the least, with diagonals the most lucrative and vertical in between (this change from Columns makes sense considering the different building method).</resource>

The games are designed so that you can ease into play, familiarizing yourself with menus, options and player controls. 
The Alliance and Hierarchy each possess different types of warships. Each vessel has its own maneuvering and firing characteristics, plus a unique special power that you can employ when circumstances dictate.

The game has two modules: the Melee, in which you can simply blast the computer or another player to smithereens using one of 16 different ships, in either Hierarchy or Alliance fleets; or, should you wish for a more challenging game, lets you play one of 9 preset scenarios.</resource>

    <resource id="287b60eda9a83a61b911ae5e0822254db281af98" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Starfleet I: The War Begins is a 1984 strategy computer game designed by Trevor Sorensen and developed by Interstel (some versions by Cygnus Multimedia). It was released for Apple II, DOS and Commodore 64. Versions for the Commodore 128 (bundled together as Commodore 64/128, though it included a discrete version for the 128 with 80-column support,) Atari ST and Atari 8-bit were released in 1986 and versions for the Amiga and Macintosh were released in 1987. The game was successful enough to spawn sequels which are collectively known as the Star Fleet series.

The game resembles the Star Trek text game. The player is a new graduate of Starfleet Academy in command of a starship. The Federation is at war with the Krellans and Zaldrons, so the player has plenty of combatants to engage from the beginning. Eschewing digital graphics, Star Fleet I presents all its information in color ASCII characters. Gameplay centers on two main activities: navigation and combat. Navigation takes place on the Main Computer GUI. It consists of a main star chart map, the player's current position, and visual displays. Other information may be accessed using appropriate commands. Navigation may be conducted manually or automatically</resource>

The game requires you to &amp;quot;draft&amp;quot; a team before play, composing the best possible squad based on each player's skill attributes. The game also allows a semblance of managerial control, and has an optional batting practice mode to warm up. It then allows you to play individual games, or participate in a 4 division, 24-team championship.</resource>

Three-dimensional invaders tumble and plunge toward the outpost attempting to destroy you. Your mission is to defend the base against the invaders as they attack from 8 channels on both sides of the Star Post. You must also defend against a Superalien which disrupts your viewscreen as it spirals its way toward your Star Post.

There are 3 different game versions: Beginner, Advanced, and Hyper. You must maneuver your laser cannon in a circular or back-and-forth motion while firing on aliens. In addition, your outpost is equipped with a special SuperZap laser which eliminates all aliens currently on your viewscreen. SuperZap are added at the rate of 1 per level, and unused Zaps are stored for later use. Your Star Post can withstand only 7 alien hits per level of play. Each new level resets the number of hits to 0, but 8 hits in any one round destroys your Star Post.</resource>

The player's ship can shoot in two directions, but the shooting frequency is rather low. Unlike in most other Shoot'em Ups, enemies do not simply fly through the screen and can be either destroyed or dodged. Instead, they stay onscreen, trying to destroy the player's ship until they are defeated. There are numerous different enemy types, each following a unique attacking-pattern. Some enemies try to close in, while others always shoot from a distance. There are also bombers, who fill the screen with indestructible bombs, as well as ships that can become temporarily invisible. To further increase the challenge, there are also passages in which asteroids have to be dodged or the ship has to be maneuvered through narrow passages.</resource>

Every Federation starship set to discover the nature of the problem has also mutinied and joined the Klingons. To avoid the mutiny spreading to the entire Federation, Starfleet plans to wrap the entire area in a Klein Sphere, sealing it off forever.

In a last attempt to find out what is happening, Starfleet sends in the Enterprise before the Sphere is set up. Its five year mission is to attempt to discover what is causing the defections, and hopefully stop them. If you fail in your mission, the Sphere will be made permanent, if you succeed the Sphere will be dropped, avoiding a potential war with the Romulans.

The game is basically a graphical adventure with some real-time combat and piloting. The game progresses by flying to planets, beaming down on them, and retrieving any items you find. There are several possible solutions to the game, with clues found along the way.</resource>

The graphical style is similar to the first Star Wars game, using vector graphics with a first-person perspective. The first sequence takes place on the ice planet Hoth, where the player must destroy Imperial probe droids. The droids send transmissions to the Empire that can also be targeted and destroyed. Once enough transmissions have been sent, the Empire attacks. In the second sequence, the player has to fend off Imperial walkers, either by shooting a limited number of tow cables at their feet or by targeting a small area at their head with lasers. But sooner or later, the Rebel base's power generator will be destroyed and the evacuation begins. In the third sequence, the Millennium Falcon has to destroy TIE Fighters in space. In the fourth and final sequence, the Falcon must navigate through an asteroid field, avoiding collisions. Once the four sections have been completed, the game restarts at a higher difficulty level.</resource>

You control Princess Leia on a speeder bike racing through the forests on Endor. You have to evade trees and deal with enemy troopers by shooting at them or luring them into Ewok traps. In the second sequence, you control Chewbacca who has captured an Imperial AT-ST Walker, evading tree traps and shooting at enemy walkers. In this sequence, the perspective sometimes switches to the Millennium Falcon which you must guide through a fleet of enemy Star Destroyers and TIE Fighters. In the final sequence, the Millennium Falcon enters the Death Star and has to make its way to the reactor, surviving more TIE Fighters and laser turrets. Once the reactor is destroyed, you have to get out again before the explosion engulfs the ship. After the Death Star has been destroyed, the game restarts at the first sequence, but with a higher difficulty.</resource>

In 2746 after many centuries of war between the eight planets of the system, they decided to build up this anti-matter zone around the entire system as protection against each others. It worked fine for several decades - the peace remained unthreatened. But now the time has come that the Rubicon barrier has been breached, by the entry of a new planet and its hostile home race, the Space Thugs. Enter your Starfox fighter, save the whole system, and find out who breached the system.</resource>

Your task is to fight them off using only an obsolete Airborne Ground Attack Vehicle. This was designed as the ultimate combat machine, with sophisticated hardware up to Draziw Yarg's high standards. It has a fully-rechargeable shield, plasma drive unit, an inbuilt scanner and 10,000-sector map, a top speed of 2550 Urads and two homing missiles.

The game is viewed from within AGAV's cockpit, with control over speed, weapon targeting and firing. There are several control options to decide exactly how the craft works, with fixed or floating sighting, and the option of automatic centering, allowing you to balance the game between easy sighting and advanced shooting ranges.

Repair depots must be visited frequently, as they can refill the weapon bays as well as repairing the ship. Crucially, the Egron Stargliders need 3 missiles to shoot down, so at least 1 visit to a depot is required to complete this job, at which point you move up to the next, harder, level.</resource>

This involves collecting various items (the exact combination is different every time you load the game) and taking them to the planet's core.

The game is an arcade adventure viewed from the side, with 512 screens arranged in a 16x32 pattern. A teleport system exists, so once you find the codes you can get quick access to different parts of the game.

The creatures to avoid are intelligent, getting tougher to predict as you get closer to the centre, but you are armed with a gun and can also try to avoid them. BLOB has a set of platforms which can be used to allow limited vertical movement, but these disappear after a few seconds each use.</resource>

To do this he must blow bubbles to catch the grubs that they feed on and guide them through the level by blowing on them or nudging them past any obstacles in the way to the nest where T'yungunz live.  To complete a level, you must make sure that a certain number of T'yungunz are fully fed so they go to sleep.  If they don't get enough food then eventually they die.

The levels are full of contraptions such as bellows, and obstacles such as spikes and fire that will burst the bubbles.  Some of these can be activated or deactivated using various switches.

Usually Steg navigates each level by walking on the floor, and also he can climb up the walls and even walk on the ceiling.  There are also devices he can contruct out of the parts from the Acme Bionic Bitz Catalogue, such as the Rocket Pack, and Bionic Legs, which allow different ways of getting around each level.</resource>

The leaders of Earth respond by sending the Terran Fleet on their way to Arcturus to intercept Draxon's armada. But this was a deadly mistake: the Arcturans have discovered warplinks, which allow them to transport troops from one link to another instantaneously, even across vast interstellar distances. With the fleet halfway across the galaxy, the enemy has already reached the Sol system and occupied Saturn's moon Titan. Now, humanity's only hope is the experimental Raven armored vehicle. One courageous pilot must take the Raven through seven different star systems, from Titan to Arcturus, defeating any and all Arcturans, using the warplinks to travel from one system to the next.

Stellar 7 is a first-person action game inspired by Atari's Battlezone, with similar wireframe graphics. In each of the seven levels, the player must defeat a number of enemies. Doing so reveals the warplink that takes the Raven to the next system. 

Next to a cannon, the Raven is equipped with radar, shields, and a cloaking device. The cloak drains the energy level of the vehicle substantially, and the depletion of the energy reserves or the shields destroys the Raven. Some of the levels include fuel bays that allow the player to recharge the energy.

Various enemies await on the different worlds. These include both ground vehicles (sleds, tanks, hovercraft) and aircraft as well as stationary laser turrets, homing bombs, robot drones and more. All enemies vary in firepower, speed and armor ratings. An in-game mission briefing introduces most adversaries, but some special ones come as surprises.</resource>

Das Spiel kann alleine oder abwechselnd mit bis zu vier Spielen gespielt werden.

Instead, you are scored based not only on how many points you score legitimately, but also on how many points you concede through foul shots, and how many shots you take in total. You always take the next shot, even if you've missed or fouled, so in a one player game the break-building strategies can be slightly more aggressive than in a real match, as there's no risk of leaving an opponent a chance

As in the real game you start off by trying to pot a red (there are 10 or the real 15, depending on which mode you choose), and if successful choosing one of the 6 colours (by pressing the number corresponding to its points value). Once you've lined up the direction of the shot, you will have to set the speed, and then the spin.</resource>

This is where you come in as a Security Guard, as you start on top of the final carriage of the train and must walk across it, jumping over the gaps, to reach the front. Redmen must be kicked into oblivion with a precise contact before they can throw you off the train; they will also throw knives, which must be ducked.

You can turn the tables thanks to the Snakebird, which will pick you up if you jump into it, and allow you to drop on top of a Redman. You have a limited amount of time to reach the front, indicated by the ground moving backwards as the train moves forwards. In the second part of the game you are inside the train, trying to survive long enough for the whole thing to begin again with increased difficulty.</resource>

You, in a space suit and with a laser gun, have to regain control of a factory located in Outer Space. The factory, where robots are produced, has been taken over by aliens and they are reprogramming the robots to take over planet Earth.
To take over control of the factory you have to reach the central Control Room but to get there you have to overcome many obstacles and collect several objects.
These objects can be used to perform several tasks of which some must be done before you take over the computer by stopping it.
Fuel and patches for your suit can be picked up and retrieve items such as rings and spanners, which are given out by robots or just left around on the floor.

Without the money you and the other four members have decided to train and face the yuppie's goons from the West Side by completing two training exercises before facing them in the street. 

To make sure only the best five boxers are good enough, each fighter must spend 20 seconds on the punch bag with you waggling the joystick left and right as fast as you can for each boxer. The more punches hit, the more a bar grows at the bottom of the screen grows and when it turns yellow then the fighter can move onto the next exercise. Fail to get yellow and the fighter can't fight. The screen shows the top half of the boxer from the side.

If any fighters have qualified then they can spar with six boxers. All six boxers must be defeated so the more boxers you have the better chances of beating them. Two bars at the top of the screen shows each boxers energy bar. Hitting the other boxer decreases their bar and if it reaches zero then they are defeated. If your boxer is defeated then another qualified boxer steps in. Fail to beat all six boxers then it's game over. The screen is viewed from the side with the screen scrolling a short distance to the left or right when your boxer moves.

Any boxer that qualified but lost in the sparring exercise can still fight so it's onto the streets to face six of the yuppie's goons. The screen is viewed from the side with the screen scrolling from left to right as your boxer moves. As with the sparring both fighters have an energy bar and hitting decreases it. Defeat a goon and you walk to the right to face the next one. Lose all your boxers remaining and it' s game over, defeat six goons and you have saved the gym.</resource>

Hitting the crate which is used to represent a goal more times than the opponent to win is the only rule. Your team of 5 players is selected from a pool of 24, including representations of the programmers as well as Joe Blade and other Players characters, and these can be placed at will around the pitch. Once in play you control the player nearest the ball, with full passing and shooting control available. Dirty challenges are not only permitted but encouraged.</resource>

Your goal is to travel to 5 countries (Japan, USA, England, China and Thailand) and beat 2 enemies at each of them. Many of these characters, such as Adon, Gen, and Birdie, are later seen in the Street Fighter Alpha series.

After each country you will have the chance to get additional points in a little bonus round, a feature seen later in most Street Fighter games. 

The final boss in the game is Sagat, who is the second to the last boss in Street Fighter 2. The goal is to become the greatest fighter in the world. As with most tournament fighting games once you have defeated the boss the game will reset and start from the beginning with a harder difficulty level. 

It is possible to start a two player game but there will be only one fight (between the two players) which will determine who will travel the globe to fight the computer controlled opponents.</resource>

Now he wants to become one of the big boys and join the street gang. But they set him a challenge: cutting off a curl of hair from their leader...

So in conclusion Mickey walks from left to right while defending himself again the enemy hordes. The game plays out as a standard brawler in which Mickey uses hand-to-hand combat against the foes. However, when he gets the hand of them he also can use other items like guns, baseball bats or teargas. Being hit by opponents, which sometimes hide in garbage bins, drain Mickey's energy and eventually one of his lives.</resource>

    <resource id="fa6295e47d71d8db66095bf02f08852ac284386a" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">The player starts off on the garage, where cars and parts may be purchased from the newspaper. New parts that are purchased must be installed by the player by entering the hood of or going under the car and then removing a series of screws to remove parts of the engine and transmission. Then, these parts must be re-installed in order and the bolts replaced, otherwise the car will be undrivable. To install tires, the car must be jacked up. While racing, the car will eventually run out of fuel, which the player must obtain from the gas station. The player will proceed from the garage to the local diner in order to find some competition to race. Races take place on either a dragstrip (drag race option) or an open country road. Wagers on the drag races can be set from &amp;quot;Just for kicks!&amp;quot; (no wager) to $10 and $50. On the road race wagers can be set from $25 to $100 and &amp;quot;pink slips&amp;quot; (the winner receives the loser's car). When the race starts, the player must wait for a signal to be given to go or else they forfeit the race. If the player's car doesn't have an automatic transmission, they can either &amp;quot;drop their transmission&amp;quot; during the race if they keep accelerator pressed while shifting gears, or blow the engine if the tachometer dial is in the red zone for too much. In either case, the player would lose the bet they made and would be transported back to the garage, where they have to get new parts for their car. If the player crashes their car during the race, they can get the car fixed for a fee, or have it scrapped and receive the scrap value. However, if they get involved in a serious crash or the car has already been repaired several times before, they are only able to receive the car's scrap value. During the road race the player would occasionally also get chased by police. If the player attempts to evade the police and keeps speeding, they will be fined $75 if caught. If the player slows down, they will be fined $20. Either instance results in the race being forfeited. If the player can't afford to pay the fine, they will be sent to prison. If the player doesn't have a car and their amount of money is not enough to buy the cheapest car, the game is over. The challenge is to beat The King in a road race. If you win, you get the King's car and girlfriend, and you become the new King.</resource>

    <resource id="ffaea0073474970cc854ac940081ef7ba4be7aab" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">This American football game is played on the street with three players on each team, picked from the local neighbourhood kids. Each kid has his own skill. There are three positions, Quarterback and two receivers. The idea is to get the ball to the other side of the street. The team attacking has four plays to move 10 yards by either throwing or running with the ball. If the defence can stop the other team moving more than 10 yards in four plays then they get the ball. 

The game is viewed from the side. Here you can select which play to use. When happy with your play you control the quarterback. Move him/her in any direction with the joystick. If you want to pass then press the fire button. 

There are plenty of options including how many points, how many plays etc. You can even design your own plays.</resource>

His mission is to defeat the Grand Master and put an end to his plotting once and for all.

Converted from the classic arcade game, Strider lets you run, jump, perform acrobatics and climb walls and overhangs. You wield a plasma sword, called a Cypher, through 5 levels fighting robots and guards, with mid- and end-level bosses.</resource>

He must fight his way through a forest, a ruined city, underground colonies, a roof-top battle, and finally the prison ship in which the Megantan leader is held.

The gameplay is similar to the original, consisting of running, jumping and attacking, with a very dynamic central character. The laser gun can be used while standing still; moving attacks with the sword are still possible, with the two weapons combining similarly to the Switchblade games. Tokens can be collected, which will turn you into a robot to face the end-of-level enemies if enough are collected.</resource>

It takes place at the Strategic Air Command Bombing and Navigation Competition, a real-life event that occurs every year at Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota. The best aircrews from around the world and some of the best aircraft come to participate in a series of three missions that are constantly monitored, with points awarded to aircrews in various categories. In the end, the aircrew that has gained the post points receives the Curtis E. LeMay trophy.

In this game, you are the pilot of one of these aircrews with a choice of flying one of six aircraft, and your missions will pit you against any of seven additional enemy aircraft (although you will not get to fly them). To practice flying, you can do a Free Flight; when you're ready to compete, you will get to complete a series of 16 missions. You can also design your own missions, if you like.</resource>

There are 3 skill levels, as well as two practice modes - one for the rudiments of flight and the other for combat. The action-centered nature of the title means that it can be seen as an advanced shoot 'em up rather than a pukka flight simulator.

Acquiring a lock on enemy planes and tanks is made easier by the advanced targeting technology of the planes, and escaping enemy fire is aided by the vectored thrust system. Shooting out the tanks clears ground space to set up your own bases, which must then be defended. VTOL (vertical take-off and landing) is correctly implemented, although more traditional horizontal take-offs should be used when space permits. The full range of weapons are provided; experience will tell you which to use in which situations, based on enemy volume and range.</resource>

Runner, completing each course before time runs out.

There are also enemies on each course, such as cycles, indestructible armored drones, and flying bird-like craft. Shoot or avoid them. If you hit them, you lose one of your shields (your craft has six total) and are slowed down temporarily. The more shields you have at the finish line, the more bonus points you get. Getting hit with no shields does not kill you, however. There are no lives in this game. The only way to lose is to fail to cross the finish line.

Along the way you'll encounter Boost Pads that temporarily speed you up to incredible speeds and make you indestructible. By running over enough green stars on each course, you can also earn Shockwaves, which destroy all enemies in your path.

Note that there is no accelerator in this game. Your craft always goes full speed, unless you hit something. Then you will slow down, but quickly accelerate back to full speed. Other than that, you cannot slow down and the only way to speed up is to run over a Boost Pad. Your only controls are steering left and right and aiming the gun on top of your craft up and down.</resource>

    <resource id="40abcb6b0217353cb70f4d50dcaf6fcee436da1c" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Subbuteo recreates the famous table football game, which makes for something very different from Sensible/Kick Off/FIFA style games. It's effectively a turn-based strategy game of sorts, as each player has 30 seconds to make their move (within a 30 minute match length), which involves first selecting a player, then aiming the direction in which he will be flicked, then the power and swerve of the flick are determined by the length of time the button is held down for. 

With any luck, your player will hit the ball, and hit it such that it doesn't leave the playing area, and doesn't hit an opponent. If any of those rules are violated, possession passes to the opposition. Before each flick, the team not in possession can make a 'defensive flick' involving moving one of their players into a potential blocking position (without hitting the ball or an opponent, as this is a foul).</resource>

The ship's weapon cannot be powered up and there are no end of level bosses. In between stages, &amp;quot;guardians&amp;quot; can be destroyed for extra lives. Guardians constantly fill the screen with bubbles. In order to destroy a guardian, all glowing bubbles must be shot. If the guardian isn't destroyed, the player is still taken to the next level, but doesn't receive an extra live.</resource>

There is no pure sprinting, and only the rowing and cycling can be thought of as pure joystick-waggling. The triple jump involves pressing right to start the hop (before reaching the white line), right again for the step as you land, left as you land for the jump, and then up to propel you through the sand.  I high jump, after selecting a height you feel you can clear, you use up and down to control the speed, fire to jump, and then forward to propel you over the bar.

For the javelin even you hold down fire to build up speed, and push left to throw the javelin, holding it left before releasing to change the angle. In the equestrian event, you must use up to increase speed, and fire or right to jump when appropriate to clear the hazards - too many faults will see you disqualified.

Fencing involves moving your foil using the joystick, always staying one step ahead of your opponent, retreating when appropriate. The kayaking event involves navigating a river by controlling the direction, ensuring that all the gates are past correctly even when this requires some precise lining up. You can also load the events from Summer Games 1 in, to play all 16 events in a marathon session.</resource>

Each game contains both an action and strategy element; you'll need to run fast to avoid creatures and falling boulders, but also need to carefully plot your course through the cave to avoid becoming trapped. When you have collected enough diamonds on the current level, you can make your way to the exit for the next, more difficult round.

When the player reaches the right hand side of the screen their goal is to claim the carrot that is being dangled in front of them. If they get the carrot they are transformed into Super Bunny and must begin their journey back across the screen. In this super powered form the player can take revenge and defeat the critters standing in their way.

Super Bunny is similar to &amp;quot;cross the road&amp;quot; games such as the arcade game Frogger and Activision's Freeway.

The original box came with a complete &amp;quot;Super Bunny&amp;quot; comic book written and illustrated by air-brush artist Martin Cannon, staff artist at Datamost.</resource>

There are 9 tracks at each of the 4 difficulty levels, which can be raced in any order (although the last track you race is made harder than usual). In the races you win money, which can be spent on the usual handling and power upgrades, as well as forward-shooting missiles. You must finish in the top 3 of each race to progress - initially there are 4 computer opponents, but more are added as you progress through the game You can upgrade your car throughout the game via the shop section. You are given an initial price, but also a number of options of things to say to the salesman ? get the right combination and the price will drop.</resource>

The game is viewed from behind the bike, which tilts as you turn. You are racing against the clock, although there are lots of other bikes on track to avoid and ride around. There are 3 skill levels, which affect the amount of time you have to complete the level, and the bonus offered if you manage to (the amount of time left, divided by a set number, bigger on lower levels). Your bike has 3 gears and appears to have a top speed of around 120 MPH. After every 2 races there's a bonus round in which you must pick up as many tokens as possible in the time limit.</resource>

In this game you race a motorcycle around the world, completing each section of track within a time limit. There are other bikes on the road, but beating this is not important, so they can be thought of as moving obstacles. Each continent is a different difficulty level: Africa is beginner, Asia is junior, the Americas are senior, and Europe is expert.  

This is a very simple and straightforward game, viewed from behind the bike in 2D (so the screen does not tilt with the bike). The right/left controls are steering, and up/down are gear changes. Your cycle is always moving, and your speed strictly depends on the gear you are in, although contact or running off the road slows the bike down.</resource>

Enemies include saboteurs that plug up the pipes, bugs that fall from the ceiling to kill the player, and a monster that patrols the pipe in later levels. The player is armed with a gun that can kill bugs, saboteurs, as well as the monster (but only from behind), and is followed by a helper that can remove plugs and kill the smaller bugs. In later levels, a series of walls protect the enemies as they climb the ladder on the right towards the roof.

Gameplay is flick-screen and platform-based. Spiders and guards' darts must be avoided - contact with these drains your energy from its initial 99, as does falling any distance, although health tablets can be collected. Hearts must be collected from each screen, as must keys to operate the medieval lifts.</resource>

The basic aim is to ride a motocross bike through hazardous courses within the time limits.

The game uses a split-screen display, with a big window viewed from the side as well as a longer-range aerial view - the latter is useful for dodging hazards to the left or right, as the side-view doesn't demonstrate these accurately. The bike has 3 gears, and you must use a low gear to go uphill. You will need to do wheelies to ensure good landings from the big jumps, and to clear divots in the ground.</resource>

The game is viewed from above, with rotational control and forward/reverse power for the tank. The routes to travel along are narrow and varied, so some exploration is required – some paths are inevitably safer and faster than others. The walls are particularly useful as they are strong enough to deflect shots, so you can often attack from safe positions round a corner.

Opposition includes gun turrets firing at you, enemy tanks and landmines. You start with a standard gun, which must be held down longer to take out tougher foes, but can collect smart bombs and shields. A first-person viewpoint section follows each of these sections, with the sighting under your control, and more helicopters and jeeps to take on.</resource>

    <resource id="790215adbcc82db996ecef141e3960df30d0e10a" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Super Zaxxon is a three-quarter perspective, space shooter style game. You must first go over a base on an asteroid. Things located on this base include gun implacements, fuel tanks, radar stations, missiles, and fighters. After you successfully navigate this base, you will go through a tunnel to tangle with enemy fighters, mine layers, and mines. You then will have to navigate through a series of barriers on another asteroid in order to take on the Super Zaxxon's, the enemy robot dragons. The game is very similar in appearance to Zaxxon. The differences are: Your fighter moves much faster. This makes going after ground targets a big challenge. The graphics are different. Although this is more of a viewing difference, it can still change ones perspective after they have gotten used to the Zaxxon graphics. There is no more outer space battle. Instead, you must go through a narrow tunnel to get to area 3. Instead of 20 fighters, you now have to tangle with 25 fighters in area 2. A new enemy, the Mine Layer, is introduced. As the name implies, this ship lays mines in your path. You can destroy the mines but it takes a few hits. Instead of encountering one Zaxxon robot, you now have to deal with three Super Zaxxon, dragon looking robots. The placement of things (fuel tanks, gun implacements, etc.) in areas 1 and 3 is different then in Zaxxon. There are now indestructible, elevated guns in area 1. These guns sit on the right side and they are 2.5 units in altitude.</resource>

Unusually, the screen is split horizontally, with your action only ever using half of the screen. You can play a full season of races, or run at one of the 12 tracks as a stand-alone race (including Assen, Mugello, the old Hockenheim and Spa). A manual gearbox option and 3 skill levels ensure that you can't master the game immediately. Full information on your speed and revs, the race order and course layout are on screen at all times. Superbike Challenge is an updated version of Grand Prix 500 cc, with a better menu and title screen and some different in-game graphics.</resource>

You must explore three parts of the city stopping the criminals but also finding and rescuing girls on top of the roof-tops and taking them back home. If you hit a criminal, get shot, have a granny or girl killed then your Crimewave Overload meter rises and if it reaches the top then you lose one of three lives. If you punch a criminal or rescue a girl or granny then the meter decreases. Once you have completed three levels then you repeat them but this time at night with more people to rescue and with more criminals and faster ones. As well as the main playing area you can also your score, number of lives, your rescue quotas and your Crimewave Overload meter.</resource>

The game area is split into six sectors; 3 in the streets of Metropolis and 3 underground. Frantic citizens are running around the city and can be directed by deflectors  or by using super powers . The players cannot leave a sector until they collect a diamond . They then get to choose which sector to move to.

In between each sector is a 'combat zone' mini-game These come in a variety of styles. If the player who chose to leave the sector wins, the game moves on to the chosen sector. If they lose, play returns to the previous sector. In the sectors, the players can fire beams of set lengths (Superman uses heat vision, Darkseid fires an omega ray).</resource>

You are the Central Mentality on an advanced semi-automated planet. You were supposed to sleep - in limited cryogenic suspension - for the next 500 years, 20 miles beneath the surface of the planet, while the great Filtering Computers maintained all surface systems. But the computers have taken you out of suspension because something is terribly wrong: the weather has become brutal, food production is dangerously low, and the Transportation System is malfunctioning, causing unprecedented accidents and casualties. The planet is in chaos.

You are physically immobilized. But you have six robots at your disposal, and you must manipulate them strategically to bring the Filtering Computers back into balance. Each robot has a distinct perception of the world and offers you specific abilities - one offers you sight; a second, hearing; a third, access to information in the computer memory banks. Through the robots, you must save the planet from destruction.</resource>

Shape of tiles varies from big and small squares to triangles or hexagons. If tiles have no neighbor tiles you may take appropriate tiles from the pocket of the limited size to eliminate the rest of the tiles. Finishing the level, player will be transferred to the higher level if the results of the current level were high enough for such level. But to finish level successfully, player should acquire the certain number of points and to be qualified for the next level. The difficulty also raises and depends on quantity of colours, the shape of the tiles, and time limit presence. Undo moves are also present, but such moves decrease your final results. Game may be saved in progress and loaded later. 

Best scores and levels will be written in High Score Table.</resource>

Players take the role of Fritz, the eldest brother of a Swiss family that has been shipwrecked in the oceans of the East Indies en route to Port Jackson, Australia. As the game begins, it is your goal to find a way off of the ship, onto the deserted island, and build a shelter to survive. Numerous challenges await Fritz as he has to defend against tropical storms, hostile animals, and the mischievous antics of his youngest brother Francis, which can sometimes hinder the player's progress. Swiss Family Robinson is a classic-style text adventure game, using basic word commands and phrases to talk to your family, take action, or accomplish goals. As with most games of the the time, you have to explore the details of the scenery in order to find clues and items that will aid your survival. There are some &amp;quot;help&amp;quot; features in the game to give a player additional info. such as a &amp;quot;Help&amp;quot; key, a mapping/navigation system, and an actual &amp;quot;Guide to Nature&amp;quot; book that contains detailed information on island flora and fauna, as well as basic survival skills.</resource>

The player can move in any of the four directions (and diagonally), and fire darts. Only three darts can be fired at a time. These will ricochet off some walls, and be absorbed or cause holes to form in others. They are also the primary method for defeating the various monsters that are scattered about. Monsters can also be defeated by coming into contact with you, but you will in turn take damage. The player has a number of stats. These include health (hit-points) and Armour class, which measures the player's defensive ability and is increased by collecting better armor and rings. There is also experience which is increased by defeating monsters, and will cause the player to level up (increasing hit-points) every so often. The experience levels are equally spaced, with the gap depending on the game difficulty that is selected at the start of the game. The player's dart attack effectiveness is based on the weapon they are carrying, which may be dagger, morning-star, axe and sword, each of which may be enchanted up to +3.</resource>

Sword Slayer is a fighting game where the game is viewed from the side and you must fight various opponents one at a time with your sword and shield as well as face an Eagle that swoops in. Once you have escaped the Arena you must defend against arrows flying towards you at different heights from the right of the screen. You and your opponent have three parts of energy. As you hit and block your opponent you attempt to get a clean hit and if a hit connects then the person hit loses a part of their energy. Lose all three and it's game over. The game also allows another player to play and that person plays as your opponents.</resource>

Their job is to destroy the swarms of aliens – including flying saucers, tie fighters, space jellyfish, unidentifiable blobs, and the like – and dodge their fire. This can be achieved by shooting them with the standard zapper or use a smart missile to destroy everything in sight. 

When an entire swarm is destroyed, getting the token that appears give the player a roving sight, sideways-firing missiles, extra lives, extra missiles, and so on. Between each swarm, a meteor shower appears, and players need to avoid being hit.

Each level can have different set of paddles, sometimes one at the top and one at the bottom, sometimes one left one right, sometimes four stacked-up etc. This gives each level a distinctly new gameplay.

There are unbreakable blocks, monster generators (also unbreakable) and glass refractors that change the balls movement angle as it passes through.

After a level is cleared, the player must choose the next level by moving on a 8x8 grid of levels.</resource>

There are four customers, each has its own lane lengthier than the previous one, whom you have to keep at bay. If they reach the end of the lane without receiving their beer, you're a goner; if you miss one and accidentally spill beer needlessly you lose a life and should one of them throw you back the mug and you fail to catch it, you lose a life as well.

Occasionally a bizarre icon will appear on one of the lines and, should you grab it, will invoke a &amp;quot;cabarette&amp;quot;-style show which will keep some of the customers occupied.

The Xbox 360 version includes bonus rounds, as well as co-op and versus multiplayer modes, also online, along with achievements.</resource>

All the strange places and creatures he can dream about really exist in an alternate reality.

He hopes that Gramps will always remain asleep, which assures Snarl's own existence!

Now it's up to you, the hero of the game to travel to the alternate dimension of Tonetown and to rescue your grandfather. You interact with the environment by either typing in commands, or choosing one of the action icons available as interface. The game, therefore, combines text-based interaction with the more modern &amp;quot;point and click&amp;quot; approach.</resource>

Tazzman can only stand still and shoot in four directions, but cannot shoot while moving. Several hazards prevent Tazz from achieving his goal. Two nasties pursue Tazz, but he is supplied with bombs that he can use to wipe them out, as well as stop the walls from closing in on him. Once Tazz has killed all bugs on the screen, the left and right exits will open up, allowing him to escape into the next room before he is crushed. Every two rooms there is a bonus room which allows Tazz to collect all the numbers, obtain more bombs, and leave through either side.</resource>

Play as all four of the turtle heroes, rescue April, and then rescue your sensei Splinter from Mecha-Turtles clutches than go after The Shredder deep in the bowels of The Technodrome itself.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is an action game based on the late eighties/early nineties cartoon series of the same name. Play as Leonardo, Michaelangelo, Donatello and Raphael (one turtle only, but the ability to swap between turtles at any time) as you save your friends and battle The Shredder and his cronies. There are no 'lives', as such - when you lose a turtle, he becomes 'captured', and you cannot use him again until you rescue him from a place hidden in the overworld.

Gameplay takes place in two perspectives: a top-down view, which lets you run around and explore buildings, sewers and other places. When entering places from the top-down view, the perspective shifts to a side-scrolling view, where most of the battling takes place. In addition to each turtle's main weapon, sub-weapons (such as shuriken) can be acquired, to use at foes - these have a limited use.</resource>

Enemies are in short supply - the game's feel resembles Artificial Dreams (from the same designer). You have limited fuel and must collect fuel tokens to recharge this. Other available powerups include points bonuses, extra lives, changes to the constant speed of scrolling, and invincibility from force fields (although not enemies).</resource>

The player controls a ship, initially with limited firepower. Numbered pods appear containing further parts of the ship that will increase firepower. These additional parts combine with the player's ship to increase its firepower, and the final module transforms it into a fiery phoenix which is invulnerable for a certain period of time. Once the ship has multiple sections, the player may also split it, allowing it to fire in multiple directions. The player begins with three lives and it is possible to play with either one or two players. Home conversions of the game appeared on the NES, Commodore 64, and the ZX Spectrum. Dempa also released a port of both Moon Cresta and Terra Cresta for the X68000. An emulated version of the game was released in 2005 for PlayStation 2 in Japan as part of the Oretachi Geasen Zoku Sono-series. Three sequels of this game were released: Terra Force (Nichibutsu, 1987), Terra Cresta II (Nichibutsu, 1992) for PC Engine and Terra Cresta 3D (Nichibutsu, 1997) for Sega Saturn.</resource>

The first stage is based on the game Uridium where you have to fly over the surface of a planet or space-craft and blow up a certain amount of the scenery while avoiding and shooting waves of alien space craft who will shoot back at you. You can control the speed of your ship and the screen scrolls when you move as well as turn and fly the other way and you will need to turn if you reach the end of the level and you haven't destroyed enough of the scenery. There are various icons and they can affect your ship like destroy your ship or reverse the controls. 

The second stage is a simple shoot-em-up where you shoot or avoid waves of ships as you from move left to right with the screen scrolling constantly. You can't turn or control your speed. The final stage will see you face an end of level boss. Destroy the boss and it's of to the next level. Touching or being shot on any stage or level will see your power bar decrease and if it empties then you lose one of three lives. Lose all three and it's game over.</resource>

    <resource id="7b7eac6c86c1e11950cf5614747ce1cfcdbbfa4a" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">This multi-level action/adventure takes players back 40 years to find Professor K.K. Renegade, who predicts that a catastrophic asteroid is heading straight for earth. You're in charge of finding Professor Renegade. Select one of the five most intrepid Adventurers from England, France, Germany, Japan, and the U.S. to spearhead the search. Professor Renegade was last seen in the unexplored region of the highest Tibetan ranges; an area populated by creatures and conditions of the professor's own design: venomous stone snakes, reptilian birds, and acid storms. Not only must your Adventurer survive these tests of courage, but he must and properly use such curious objects as spurs, a vacuum cleaner, and a unicycle. Once you locate the professor and convince him to help, you'll need to help him construct an anti-asteroid deflector to prevent the destruction of earth. You must now search for high-tech tools such as an atomic pile, a 9-volt battery, and a bent coat hanger! Use the joystick and the appropriate keys to maneuver the Adventurer across the landscape. You have 30 days to complete the mission. During the mission, the Adventurer collects various items (points are awarded for each). Some items serve little purpose; others are vital; and others only work in certain places. Only one item can be held at a time and it must be held to be used. Native bearers carry the items collected. To look at what each bearer has, type 1 or 2 to scroll through the bearers. The Adventurer can exchange the item held (press S) with a bearer that is closest to him. Its trial and error time. Good luck. The game comes with cheats and a map for those that require a little help.</resource>

Different joystick combinations let your fighter perform high, middle or low attacking moves as well as dodge or block his opponent's attacks. Fighters receive scores for successful attacks. The more difficult or effective the attack, the higher the score. Unless one fighter is knocked out, the fighter who has the highest score at the end of three rounds wins.

Although the game is shown from an isometric perspective, it is not possible to move in three dimensions.</resource>

To make things more difficult you have limited time in form of a fuel tank which will get refilled after you cleared a number of waves. Besides that, your spacecraft is equipped with a laser that tends to overheat. Every shot makes the heat bar of the laser increase a bit. Once it reached its maximum you can't fire anymore and are forced to wait until it cools down while slowly running out of fuel.</resource>

Now one day, Berk, along with his friend Drutt, decided to explore his domain by going through the Trap Door.

You take control of both Drutt and Berk, swapping between them with the fire button. They need to solve a series of puzzles and deal with new creatures along the way. There are four regions to explore, and opening locked doors give access to later regions. Scattered throughout the regions are sweets and toadstools which, when consumed, will provide Berk with special characteristics. Progress is made by using the two characters together, as Drutt can reach places that Berk cannot.</resource>

The action is viewed from the side, with the graphics drawn in vectors, in keeping with the mathematical nature of everything that unfolds.

As a Resistance fighter, the player must fly into enemy lines in order to steal Klystron Pods to power more advanced starships, using your tractor beam to take them. A network of mounted guns are aiming to shoot the player down – these can be disabled by shooting their power source, but eventually this will explode, forcing the player to flee. Some of the later levels feature reverse gravity, which is where things really get difficult.</resource>

While the essence of the game remains very similar there are some differences second time round.

The Federal Resistance has captured an artificial planet of great strategic importance in the war against the Galactic Empire. However, the purification of the planet's atmosphere is not yet complete.

You must search the planet for 16 orbs, the majority of which lie below the surface, these are required for the construction of an atmospheric processor. This will involve descending into the maze-like tunnels of the planet, avoiding (or destroying) a variety of androids in your path and returning to the surface with the orbs in tow.</resource>

North Vietnam was divided up by the US military into a set of target zones referred to for some reason as &amp;quot;Route Packages (RPs)&amp;quot;. The most heavily defended area was &amp;quot;RP-6A&amp;quot;, in and around Hanoi. To enter into this target area, the F-105s had to fly over a region of hilly ground that became known as &amp;quot;Thud Ridge&amp;quot;.

You are starting your career in &amp;quot;Wild Weasels&amp;quot; as Lieutenant, description of your first mission is to get the feel of your &amp;quot;Thud&amp;quot;, but it is just a start of perilous and glorious ladder. The next missions vary from eliminating the Doumer tankers or bombing the bridge to dropping the leaflets or engaging the MiGs. Your rank may be raised if mission will be accomplished.

In the very beginning of each mission you should read the mission description, accept of decline this mission, and equip your aircraft with weapons and supplies. Taking off the airbase either from Korat or another place, you should flight to your destination eliminating the opponent MiGs, run the &amp;quot;Ridge&amp;quot;, and complete your mission. The gameplay flows in third-person view with common flight simulator abilities.</resource>

Helpful are the two weapon systems: the unlimited standard attack and a special attack which causes every enemy on the screen to die.

In a secret underwater base, the evil Madame Q is determined to control the world. To that end she has kidnapped thousands of beautiful girls to use in her diabolical experiments. Players are part of a team of experts hired by the government to find and penetrate Madame Q's fortress and free the hostages. After the submarine reaches its destination, players scuba dive to get to the base and must avoid mines and chemical spills as well as battle sharks and enemy divers with their spear-shooting harpoons.

The inside of the fortress is very similar to the territory in Rolling Thunder, and because of this ThunderJaws is considered by many as the unofficial sequel to that game. Levels get progressively harder, more elaborate and contain more enemies as the game progresses. Additional weapons are obtained when dropped by fallen enemies.

The game can be played by single players or in 2-player mode.

Each of these involves a two-man squad, whom you can switch between at any time. Each must select the correct objects to bring beforehand. You will have to move through the screens via lifts and ladders, avoid hazards and solve puzzles.

Mission one is set in a mine shaft, which is rapidly flooding and has two miners trapped. Next up is a nuclear submarine stranded after hitting a mine, which must be repaired and reactivated before it explodes. During this mission, you discover evidence of the miner's construction, so must break into a bank to steal the appropriate documents. This reveals that a madman is holding International Rescue to ransom, so you must finally travel to his lair to stop him.</resource>

For further challenges, there are finally sea rescue and armed escort missions. Each mode has three levels of difficulty. You have a limited selection of guns and missiles for combat, and an onboard computer guides you through missions.

The goal is easy to explain: destroying the enemy base at the end of five levels and avoiding the own destruction. Attackers only appear on the ground and using the standard cannon normally takes care of them. Additionally there is a limited amount of smart bombs available which can be unleashed at any time to wipe out everything on the screen. 

Extras can be collected after shooting boxes on the ground: smart bombs go into the inventory while everything else, e.g. turbo speed or better range, are limited in time and used immediately after picking them up. After losing one of the three lives, the current level has to restarted from the beginning.</resource>

As terrorists bomb his laboratory, he gets sucked ten million years into the past. During the course of his adventure he will visit five time zones with five screens each.

This is an adventure with action elements. Most of the game is spent manipulating objects in the different time zones which have an effect on a later zone, e.g. planting a seed in the stone age will cause a tree to appear in the later zones. He also may need to bring an object from one time to another. In each zone there is one big puzzle to solve in order to get access to the next zone (the ultimate goal is to prevent the time machine from getting destroyed), but constant traveling between the time zones is necessary.</resource>

Every table is divided into twp parts with their own paddles: the game only scrolls if the ball goes down. The four tables are: Volcano: The winning condition is to spell the table's name by using the associated volcano lanes. Ruins: In the middle of the table there is a &amp;quot;collect ball&amp;quot; hole. If all targets were hit and two balls were collected in the hole, a special fire ball is set loose. The stage is won when bringing this ball into the hole. Saqqarah: This pyramid themed table also required spelling a name by knocking down targets and hitting a special hole.

There is a document explaining how to be King but the problem is it is in seven pieces and the pieces are lost. The bigger problem is that each piece is in a different time zone which are 9600 BC, 893 BC, 86 BC, 1692, 1849, 3456 and 9999. Luckily in your house you have a Time Machine but a part is missing so you need to search your house for it before you can travel and search Time.

In each time zone, puzzles need solving by picking up objects and placing them in the correct locations which even means travelling with them through time and placing them in the correct location in the correct time period. To slow you down you can only carry one piece at a time but you can store in your magic closet eight items for storage which can be entered anywhere by holding down the fire button for a few seconds.. You also have the ability to fire lasers as well.

Time Tunnel is a flick-screen arcade adventure with each room or a part of each location shown on the screen at an elevated angle. The joystick is used to control your Gnome and to interact with objects and the locations. The fire button fires your lasers.</resource>

Gameplay consists of moving your character in real-time through various terrains, like forests, towns, and dungeons. The player gathers basic items, like health and magic potions, and increasingly powerful weapons as you progress through the story. Conversations are handled through keyphrases. Combat is real-time as well, against a few types of creatures (skeletons, orcs, rogues) of which there can be various flavors.</resource>

Yellow spheres boost energy, and so should be collected. This is followed by a platform-based battle, as the evil Captain Jurgen has tied up several crew members, planted time bombs, and started several fires. Use your extinguisher on Jurgen and the fires, and touch the bombs and crew members to solve those problems. Turn gravity off to reach the more troublesome bombs.</resource>

    <resource id="5aa827ab653a635922758488c79ab8ce2c01a657" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Titan is a 2D arcade game / puzzle game hybrid.

For some reason, mad professors of the future tend to invent strange entertainment games in which every participant dies. Professor Hybrys’ variant is called Titan and involves a ball, a control unit and 80 labyrinths. Your objective is either to destroy all destructible blocks in each level by hitting them with the sphere, or to pilot it to the exit. The black ball is beyond your control; it will bounce straight or diagonally through the labyrinth with constant speed. You move the control unit, a small box, with you are to position in a way that the ball bounces off it in the desired direction. You can also catch the sphere by quickly moving over it, and then release it in a direction of your choice.

The labyrinths not only contain harmless, destructible blocks, but also increasingly difficult hazards. If the sphere or your control unit hit a skull symbol, one of your nine lives is lost. Teleporters exchange the position of you and the ball, wall pieces can be pushed around or destroyed by your unit, floor tiles will grow into walls when you pass over them too often. The high game speed can be slowed down by holding the space key – a very useful option in tricky situations.

Titan mixes an arcade game foundation (requiring quick reflexes and good nerves) with puzzle game elements (requiring logical thinking to beat the complex levels). The challenge is to control the sphere accurately, yet indirectly.</resource>

Hackensack, an insane Texas billionaire bent on conquering the world, kidnaps professor Frobisher Goonhilly, a paranormal scientist working on a matter transformation weapon. As a demonstration of its powers, Arthur transforms the Isle of White into a giant custard slice, New York into a bath sponge and the Eiffel Tower into a toast rack. The ghost Blinky, secret agent for S.P.E.C.T.R.E. (Society for the Prevention of Ectoplasmic Crime, Telekinetic misuse and Reality Endangerment), infiltrates the madman's sea ship (the newly raised SS Titanic) armed with an ectoplasmic gun and a case full of disguises.

Titanic Blinky is a platform adventure and a clone of Dizzy, replacing the egg protagonist with a slightly effeminate ghost. As in that game, the aim is to collect objects (by pulling down on the movement controls) to solve puzzles. One main difference from Dizzy is the fact that Blinky carries a gun with infinite ammunition. There's an energy bar at the bottom of the screen that gets depleted every time Blinky touches an enemy. When it's empty, Blinky literally flips over and the player loses one life. The game starts with three lives, and there's no form of saving progress.</resource>

Rommel lead the Axis forces to a victory, taking out Allied forces which were gathered to densely mine a strategic defensive area of Libya. In this tactical wargame, players can do the same. Taking the six Allied supply points is crucial to your mission's success.

You must guide the movement and attacks of your units. You can also call in aircraft and engineer support. The game is turn-based; once you have given your orders, the Allies do the same. Unit damage is progressively calculated. Unlike the Allies, you use mobile suppliers, which you also command. They should be kept in range of your units (with no Allied forces in between).

The game includes optional action sequences, which can be practised outside the main game. You control navigation, driving and gunning (with turrets and machine guns) for individual units, from a first-person view.

The main levels are side-scrolling, but between each level the game switches to a behind-the-shoulder perspective.

All the controls are realistically simulated, so the airspeed is dependent on the height of the vehicle, and you can move horizontally using the rudder option as well as rolling left and right. If using a Sinclair joystick interface you can use both ports to have all these controls accessible on dual joysticks, just like the real thing. Either way, a full instrument panel allows monitoring of these.

You are armed with cannons, rockets and anti-tank missiles, each of which has its target set up independently, but only one can be loaded at once. Flight options include day/night, clear/cloudy and air turbulence on/off, allowing beginners and experts to find a suitable setting. Scenery includes trees, mountains and pylons, while enemy targets include helicopters, turrets and tanks.</resource>

The simulation here is of a full season of major league baseball. You can view statistics for every team, and play with one or two players, or manage teams while the computer plays through the season for you. Players have injury records and performance streaks.

The game could be enhanced with several add-on disks, sold separately: Great Teams 1901-1968, A.L. Stadiums, N.L. Stadiums, Classic Stadiums, and Fantasy Manager, which let you draft players into new teams and leagues.</resource>

You rotate your tyre left or right, and drift as the current sends you, making sure to avoid the banks of the river, and the dividing lines in the middle. Hazards include crocodiles, stray logs and branches, and fishermen - you are armed with a limited supply of tin cans to take care of these. There are gates to slide through on the way down - these give you a points bonus. Each level has a strict time limit to adhere to, although there's a kickin' party at the end if you succeed.</resource>

Viewed from the cockpit in full 3D, the game is a straight head-to-head duel, against another player or the computer. You are armed with missiles (while put you in control of a small target zone, which must reman over your opponent for 3 seconds), flares and cannons (which overheat when overused)- use these more wisely than your opponent. Pay attention to speed and altitude too. The computer has 3 planes to throw at you, of which the last is the toughest, while each player in a 2-player game also has 3 'lives'.</resource>

In order to do this, Quaid must go through level after level of beating up bad guys that get in his way.

Some of the levels differ in gameplay, and range between action and driving scenes. The action scenes mainly require you to collect some items before leaving the level. You have only one chance to complete the current level, which means that if your energy is lost, the game ends. Energy is lost if you are attacked by an obstacle, or if you are shot at by an enemy. You can gain more energy by either collecting some pills or a heart, depending on the platform.</resource>

Matches can be played at quarter-final, semi-final or final level?winning at one level automatically moves the player to the next one. They can last for 3 or 5 sets, with a player requiring a 2-game lead to win a set, though a tie-break comes in at 6?6 in all but the final set.

The view is pseudo-3D, from above the court, and features a shadow on the ball to give its motion a more realistic appearance and make it easier to judge the ball's height. Spectators turn their heads to view the action, and ball boys run on to the court to retrieve dead balls. Shot speed, direction and spin can all be applied, and both forehand and backhand strokes are available.</resource>

Events include the 100 meter dash, the hammer throw, the javelin throw, the long jump, the high jump and the 110 meter hurdles.

The MSX version replaces the hurdles with a 400 meter dash.

The Famicom version loses the hammer throw and the high jump, but the NES version restores the high jump while adding skeet shooting, the triple jump and archery as events. The NES version also keeps the 110 meter hurdles and forgoes the 400 meter dash.

If the player wants to go to the next event or round then they will have to qualify, by beating increasingly difficult maximum times or minimum distances. This game contains a two player option, in which the players take it in turns.</resource>

You take charge of an international team aiming to qualify for and then play in the European Championships and World Cup. This means there is no transfer market, just a pool of 100 eligible players from which a squad of 22 is selected. You can view reports on each player's ability and form at any stage of the squad and team selection process. You can arrange friendly matches to try out players and ensure that the squad plays together as much as possible.

The matches are presented as a running commentary, with a small graphic indicating which area of the pitch the ball is in. A wide range of tactical options are available to dictate the team's passing style, defensive approach and so on, and in another first you can give specific instructions to individual players (maybe telling a particularly pacy defender to man-mark a dangerous opposition winger instead of staying in a set position).</resource>

You can jump these holes by pressing fire, although you have a limited number of these for each level, and adjust the speed by pulling the joystick forward or backwards.  You face a time limit on each of the 21 levels, although your time is boosted every time you complete one.

As Resistance member Pierre LeFeu, helped by wounded former engineer Le Duc, must prevent this happening, but taking the paintings by train to Normandy and Allied control.

Once in control of the train, you must set the throttle level, ensure that there is enough coal in the furnace, control the speed, and ensure that steam is released when necessary. Use the provided map, and the communications network once released, to plan the strategic side of your mission. Each station has coal and water supplies which may be needed to keep the train running.

You must raid railway stations in order to get track switches into the right position. Both this and the initial capture of the train involve aiming at the enemy, current indicated point, and ducking before their bullets can hit you. Taking control of bridges is similar - you control a cannon and must take aim.</resource>

In the age of steam-powered trains, there are opportunities to make money on great railroads. It will be up to the player to take control of a train on a railroad and turn a profit. The player does this by moving the train to a loading station that will supply raw material, and stopping in front of it with the appropriate car and blowing the whistle to begin the loading process. This is then delivered to the stations of industries that need them, unloading taking place the exact same way. The faster goods are delivered, the more money is made, with extra profits available when an industry is in critical need of a supply. Meters of available industry supplies can be shown on the screen. The train itself can only be stopped and move forwards and backwards, following the path of the train track, left and right movement is used only at switches, where the track splits into two directions. Each action of train movement uses coal, multiplied by the weight of the goods being carried. Coal is resupplied at the coal yard, and is loaded into the coal car the same way as other goods, spending money in order to buy coal. If the player runs out of coal while driving the train, it will cost them twice as much to have the coal delivered to the train. Every 3 minutes, $200 is deducted from the player for payroll and any crashed train costs another $200 in penalties. Each level is a unique track design, and can take place across cities, deserts, mountains and plains. As industry supplies are managed, a track is gradually built at the edge of the screen which will lead to the next level.</resource>

The struggle between the good Autobots and the evil Decepticons centers around energy as the objective is to collect four pieces of the Energon Cube and getting them back to the Autobot base. The Decepticons will do their best to get in the way and use the cubes to their own nefarious means.

You as the player control five Autobots that can either be in robot or vehicle form. You move around the platforms searching for the cubes. While in robot form you can either walk or fly, but while in vehicle form you drive around the platforms. Defensa-Pod can be used to switch between Autobots.

Once all the cubes are collected the game repeats at a higher difficulty.

Each Autobot has shields that deplete when shot at or hit by an enemy Decepticon, when all the Autobots are destroyed, it is Game Over.</resource>

    <resource id="aa6609a662f6a4500b40a598268d517ca20dff87" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Transylvanian Tower is a single player maze game in which the player must explore five levels of Count Kreepie's castle, kill him, and find his stash of loot. The castle has over five hundred different rooms to explore. Some contain items that can be used but the inventory is limited to only three items at any one time, and this includes weapons, so it's important to collect just what's important. The items/weapons available are: the golden ring, an invisible cloak, a magic apple, a special floor plan, a clove of garlic, a mirror, a knife, a dagger, a sword, a silver cross and your gun - which is limited to 10 shots. If the player is killed at any time on level 2 and beyond, the game is over and they are returned to the start of level one.

Level 1:nnThis is an exploration level. A floor plan may be obtained at any time by pressing the 'h' key.

Level 2:nnOn this level the player will encounter bats and objects. Bats are bad things and must be killed. If enough bats are killed the player will be transported to level 3. If insufficient bats are killed the player will be transported to a random room on level 2. There are sealed rooms and it is possible to be transported into one. Fortunately one of the objects encountered is a magic ring that allows the player to move through two walls, so it is advisable to carry this to avoid having to replay the game. The 'h' key can again be used to view the floor plan, but this time it's only available when a bat has been killed.

Levels 3 &amp; 4:nnThese play as level 2 but all bats must be shot through the heart.

Level 5:nnThis is where the evil Count Kreepie resides. Only one off the items you come across will kill the count. This, as the game says, &amp;quot;will force you to find all the objects so you can try them out&amp;quot;. After killing the count you will receive a map showing where his treasure is, but you must still fight the bats on the way there.

The game can be saved when necessary, but only after thirty minutes of gameplay. Control is by cursor only. Keys 5-8 move the player in the appropriate direction, key 6 rotates the character 90 degrees to the left, so pressing the 6 key twice means you're retracing your steps. Transfer between levels can take up to two minutes because a new maze is generated for each game.</resource>

The game notably contains fewer enemies than the previous title. It is more centred around inventory based problem solving.

To do this Dizzy must journey through haunted mines, tree villages, as well as underwater. The game also features a subquest (albeit one essential to completing the game) in which thirty gold coins must be collected.</resource>

The board is composed of 21 lines which cross to form triangles. The lines intersect to create 55 points where players can place their stones. The game is available for up to four players who take turns placing stones on the board. The aim is to capture the stones of the opponents by creating triangles. A triangle is created when three stones are positioned so that they can be connected with straight lines. All of the stones that are located within the triangle can then be captured if the player chooses to. When making a capture, both the player's own stones and those of the opponents are removed from the board. The player's own stones can be brought back into play while the opponents' are permanently out. To win the game the player has to become the last one still able to make a move (due to still having stones left).</resource>

    <resource id="291f80d1561fdbe77ac6609752ff741c851c9167" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">This is the earliest home computer incarnation of Horn Abbot International Ltd's classic board game, Trivial Pursuit. The game involves answering questions on one of six subject categories to gain moves, and answering questions on special squares to gain one of the six 'Wedges' you need to gain the right to take on the final winning question. Questions are aimed at British players - many entertainment questions are based on British TV, and sport questions relate to popular British sports.

Two game modes are available:- single player (which involves answering questions against the clock) and multiplayer (where you can take on up to five human-controlled players). The computer reveals the answer, and you select 'yes' or 'no' to tell it whether you got it right.

The question categories are exactly the same as the board game, however two different question styles are added to take advantage of computer technology - some questions relate to a picture or diagram and some relate to a piece of music. 

One additional feature not available in the board game is a statistical analysis of the number and type of questions answered correctly. This can be split into the performances of all the players, or the performance of an individual player within the six categories. It is especially useful at the end of the game, when choosing which category a player must answer to win the game.</resource>

Problem is shopping here is dangerous with creatures roaming and obstacles in your way. You can lose one of your four lives by touching a creature, falling from a height or touching certain obstacles. Another problem you have is that you can only carry five items at a time, once you have five you must go back to the start to pay for them and store them. Switches also need to be find to make certain walls that are blocking your path disappear.

Trollie Wallie is a platform game that scrolls when you move in all directions with a small part of the supermarket shown on screen. As well as the main playing area, you can also see your score, lives, items on your person, total items and a bonus clock that counts down from 1000.</resource>

There are two tracks to choose from, Loonies loop or Devils Deathtrack. Before the players drive you can select which gear shift to use (regular or auto) and how many laps (1-9). Each player now takes it in turns to drive round the track and complete the chosen number of laps. Your score gets higher the longer and faster you drive but straying too far off the track or hitting an obstacle on the side stops the car and stops your score from getting higher. The winner of the race is the player with the highest score.</resource>

A classic &amp;quot;Drive &amp; Shoot&amp;quot; game with stylish presentation unmatched on the C64, you control a red sports car speeding down narrow roads, shooting every car in sight while trying to avoid enemy gunfire and various obstacles as you drive through exotic locations like Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Thailand, South Africa and more.

In early stages there is little hostile activity, but in later stages almost all vehicles will shoot you on sight. You'll have to deal with cars, vans, trucks as well as helicopters and jets! Obstacles on the road, including traffic cones, mines and even rather large rocks will test your reflexes. You must collect fuel on the road to keep your car going. Finally, there are intersections where one route will lead to a dead end, causing your car to crash.</resource>

A map is built into the car, which can instantly show the positions of the baron's cars - this is crucial because you can't interrupt them before the initial deal is done, as this will simply make them leave and try again another time.

The game's environment is large and varied, with traffic lights, junctions and zebra crossings accurately implemented, and pedestrians to avoid. The roads are multi-laned, and at the end of each road you can turn across, which makes the game's perspective shift in a flick-screen manner. One unusual feature for the time is a saveable high-score table.</resource>

Taking the role of Turbo the Tortoise, the player must travel through six side-scrolling platform levels, each of them well-guarded by enemies. Limited weaponry can be collected, although jumping on the heads of these foes will also kill them. Turbo must allow for moving platforms, switches, fragile platforms and water hazards. Enhancements and extra lives are in hard-to-reach places, often only accessible by using enemy heads as launch pads.</resource>

An evil mega-robot called The Machine attacks the United Planets Ship Avalon 1, slaughtering all who resist. All - except Bren McGuire, who manages to escape and slips into the experimental Turrican bionic armor. As Turrican, he strives to show The Machine who's the boss.

Unlike other games of its type, this game contains three levels of horizontal shooter action in the spirit of R-Type or the developers' own Katakis. Six large worlds are to be explored, where you are basically free to go everywhere you want, since there is no automatic scrolling and the levels are packed with hidden extra lives and weapons. All those levels are very different: the first one in the rock desert is pretty colorful with parallaxing rainbow background and happy music, while the following worlds get darker and darker.</resource>

When he disappears you are determined to find out what might have happened to him, and what secrets may lie within.

This side scrolling arcade adventure is split into three stages, taking in the harsh and barren desert, an underground network of caves, and a tough tribal jungle. The natives are hostile to your presence, and weaponry must be found to fend them off, although its use does little to put the natives at ease initially. The machete to cut through the jungle is equally important. At many other points you will need to use objects you have found along the way. The backgrounds are in full 3D and can serve to obscure the character when he is behind trees or rocks.</resource>

Be warned as the people of the land move about in real time going about their business so people won't be in the same place twice. You have rented a hut from the local inn, The Sword Inn so you can store everything that you collect (or Steal). Other items can be found to make your quest easier like swords and armour. There is even talk that the secret of life is hidden here.
Twin Kingdom Valley is a graphic text adventure where you will see a picture (with some animation) of your location before seeing a text description of what you can see, any items and any characters in that location. You type in commands to control your player. You can ask to see your score and your strength score. Your strength score is high at the start but not eating or drinking, or being attacked will weaken you and decrease your strength score, but you can wait (if it is safe) to increase it. The aim of the game is to get 1024 points.</resource>

This left the way clear for evil men such as Maldur the druid to step in and slaughter the family, shattering their magical amulet. Only one of the family survived, and the amulet was broken into 23 pieces. As Ulopa, the sole survivor, you must reclaim the pieces. They are spread across 23 levels of platforming action, combining surface areas with some underground tunnels. You have 3 types of weapons with different functionality: switching between them at the right moments is vital. You can also collect upgrades from the carcasses of dead enemies. Other upgrades such as springs and a parachute can also be found.

Sitting in Ajax H.Q., you must pilot the remote controlled drone ship to do this. The drone represents jet fighter (behind view) and helicopter gunship (top-down view). It may be moved on the screen, fire air-to-air and air-to-ground guns and pow bomb. Limitless hordes of mechanoid invaders, whose sole intent is the total domination of the Earth, will try to stop you. Exit from each level is guarded by the powerful boss, who you should eliminate.

There are two versions of the arcade version (Typhoon in Europe and Ajax in Japan) which only differ in the order of the eight stages. The DOS and Sharp versions are based on Ajax while the Commodore 64, CPC (five levels) and ZX Spectrum (six levels) versions are based on Typhoon. The PlayStation 4 version includes both arcade versions.</resource>

The aim is to wipe out the enemy, which has gathered around the allied airspace of 'Area 88', in a series of military aircraft-based scenarios.
 You choose one of three unique pilots; Shin Kazama, Micky Schymon or Greg Gates, each with varying abilities at damage repair, weapon handling and flying skill, and engage the enemy over a series of challenging missions. The player starts out with the weakest plane, the F8E Crusader, which can only be armed with a very basic range weapons. But, through completing various missions, enough cash can be raised to purchase higher-quality aircraft. These superior planes are more agile, have improved resilience to damage and have a greater range of fire. Furthermore, the more advanced fighters can be armed with superior special weapons, such as napalm.
 The missions include attacks on sand bases, the nuclear submarine 'Seavet' and enemy supply camps, as well as seeing off groups of airborne 'bandits' who swarm-in on Area 88.
 The enemy is plentiful, and the pace is frantic. Shoot at everything on the screen that moves, and the allied forces might just come out on top......</resource>

Ultima IV is among the few role-playing games, and perhaps the first, in which the game's story does not center on asking a player to overcome a tangible ultimate evil. Unlike most RPGs the game is not set in an &amp;quot;age of darkness&amp;quot;; prosperous Britannia resembles Renaissance Italy, or King Arthur's Camelot. The object of the game is to focus on the main character's development in virtuous life — possible because the land is at peace — and become a spiritual leader and an example to the people of the world of Britannia.

The game follows the protagonist's struggle to understand and exercise the Eight Virtues; Honesty, Compassion, Valour, Justice, Sacrifice, Honour, Spirituality and Humility. After proving his or her understanding in each of the Virtues, locating several artefacts and finally descending into the dungeon called the Stygian Abyss to gain access to the Codex of Ultimate Wisdom, the protagonist becomes an Avatar.

His fundamentalist visions led him to create a police state, where failure to adhere to the virtues is punishable by death. Behind Blackthorn are the three Shadowlords, anti-thesis to the three principles of Truth, Love, and Courage. The Avatar must understand their meaning and origins, find a way to defeat them, rescue Lord British, and restore the former ethical principles of Britannia.</resource>

    <resource id="1a95665d771d34c8497cc75281e15b8f8fc9b56a" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Several years after having restored Lord British to his rightful position as the monarch of Britannia, the Avatar is captured by demon-like creatures and placed on a sacrificial altar. His friends Iolo, Shamino and Dupre appear just in time to save him. In the Britannia castle, the Avatar learns that his abductors were gargoyles, a race of enigmatic creatures who have recently invaded Britannia and occupied the shrines of Virtue. As the Avatar embarks on a quest to liberate Britannia, he begins to gain insight into the gargoyles' true motives, and realizes that it is his duty to achieve peace and understanding between the two races.

Ultima VI is notable for having a fully continuous world. There is no &amp;quot;world map&amp;quot; in the game; all the locations are seamlessly connected to each other, turning the game world into an open environment. Compared to the previous installments in the series, the game focuses more on quests and exploration rather than on combat. The latter no longer involves separate screens; battles occur during exploration, without any transitions. The turn-based system from the previous games has been preserved.

    <resource id="3df9f86ae9f5d548528e58a9911c0aa72daaaacb" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Sabreman’s second game (following Sabre Wulf and preceding Knight Lore and Pentagram) finds him trapped in an underground cavern network, split into nearly 600 side-viewed screens. There are three ways to escape, each protected by a guardian who can be killed using one of the three major weapons you can locate – a dagger, a torch and a knife.

As you explore the levels, you will encounter randomly-moving nasties, who can’t kill you but can knock you off your path and cause you to fall. Eagles can grab and drop you in mid-air. Falls of much more than a screen’s height cost you a life, although extra ones are available. Jewels can be collected for temporary invincibility.

The game’s screens are functionally split into Castle and Caverns, with the castle screens higher up. Moving across the castles involves a lot of blind jumps, often deliberately bouncing off fortuitously-placed objects such as flower pots. In the caverns, use a rope to hook onto the ceilings and move up and down – if you have found it. How many screens deep you are is noted on screen at all times.</resource>

While driving on a lonely road at night, a strange figure blocks your vision causing you to swerve and crash your car. When you regain consciousness, you find that your brother is missing (in the NES-Version it's your sister who is missing). The only place he could have gone is a creepy old mansion which looms in front of you. With nowhere else to go, you enter the mansion in search of your brother. It turns out the mansion once belonged to an old wizard and his apprentice, and somehow it has become infested with the Undead.</resource>

In later levels, there are dead-ends or gaps and a vehicle that is carrying a flag you need, so you will need to jump on it. If you are hit by another vehicle or go off the course, you lose a life. Two player games are alternating with the players taking their turns.</resource>

Your Manta class Space Fighter will be transported to each planet in turn and it is your task to destroy each Dreadnought. First you must attack the defensive screen of enemy fighters, then you must neutralise the majority of surface defences before you land on the Super-Dreadnought's master runway.

The plot involved an alien invasion of Earth by a reptilian race known as &amp;quot;The Visitors&amp;quot;. In this game, you play as Mike Donovan, a resistance leader who enters the visitors' huge spaceship in order to blow up its reactor by setting explosives at key points.

The aliens will try to stop you as will surveillance, cleaner, maintenance, and security robots. If you touch any robots or are shot by them, a static charge will cause your hearbeat to increase. If this happens several times you have to rest or it could kill you. In 8 different laboratories you will find formulas for Red Dust which is lethal to the aliens - releasing it into air purification plants will kill many of them and also slow the robots. You can use a laser or when its charge runs out, you can jump over or roll under enemies.</resource>

If it wasn't for him, where would you be after your heroic career in the army came to an abrupt end. A one-time war hero, you had put your unit on the map. You were the best and they knew it. A role model to all the young rookies. Your methods, though questionable, got the right results. However, your type worried the men at the top: &amp;quot;no man is bigger
than the job&amp;quot;, you had to go...
Intent on obtaining the secret formula your brother has devised for developing the ultimate weapon, a blood-thirsty terrorist gang has kidnapped him and his daughter. The same terrorist syndicate you had dispersed in Saigon some years previously.
Your work now seemed incomplete... You have to squash them once and for all...
The police think you were involved in the kidnapping, so you must also endeavour to clear your name.
Your paramilitary skills will be tested to the full. With your own personal collection of weaponry and an elite weapon system installed in your Ferrari F40, your strategic mission unfolds across the country.
There are docklands, army camps, airports and parks, all linked with hazardous driving sectors where possible death looms with every turning and every new piece of the puzzle solved.
This has become personal...This is now a VENDETTA.

The game has three distinctive parts: the first is set in an underground complex where blueprints containing a way to destroy the aliens have to be found. To do so the vindicator has to navigate a maze, find keycards, kill aliens in the way and finally solve an anagram puzzle. After that stands a long way towards the alien base which plays out as a vertically scrolling shooter section. Here the player takes control over a plane or - after a life loss - a jeep with a regular weapon with unlimited ammo and a special weapon (bombs or grenades) for larger enemies. Inside the base the vindicator has to navigate side-scrolling platforms while using lifts and trap doors and shooting a lot of opposition.</resource>

It is based on a British comic magazine VIZ which, like the game, features lots of crude humour and fart jokes. The player controls one of the 3 Viz characters - Johnny Fartpants, Buster Gonad, or Biffa Bacon. The race takes place in five different scrolling environments; country, town, building site, beach and a disco. During the race you have to dodge traps and other characters from the VIZ comics. There are also two mini-games for each character which include Pint Drinking, blowing up balloons with farts and Pancake Flattening.</resource>

Above your spaceship hangs a nest of space-vultures. One after one, they come down to shoot at you. Unlike Galaga, they don't wrap at the end of the screen, instead they &amp;quot;bounce&amp;quot; back and forth across it. Mind the vulture's course, because otherwise you might find yourself trapped in a corner with the inevitable collision as only way out. A good tactic to ameliorate your chances is to dodge the vulture's bullets and concentrate your fire on its mates that are left hanging above. When all the vultures are killed, their eggs start to hatch and spawn similarly devious creatures. Shoot them down, and you have passed the first level.</resource>

The board is divided into 20 shapes around the edge, each of which has a value from 1 to 20 points, a special double area around the edge and a special treble area in the middle (each of which multiply the shot score). There is also a bullseye right in the middle for 50 points and an outer bull around it, worth 25 points.

Players always take three shots at a time. In the 501 game the aim is to reduce the score from 501 to 0, finishing with a double or the bull. If the score reaches 1 or a negative number, any shots in that set of 3 are cancelled out. In Round The Board, the player must hit each target in turn starting with 20, but moving back 2 or 3 for a double or treble, eventually finishing with Double Top.</resource>

All the bunkers need destroying to obtain this vital information as well as show the exact location of the Commander who keeps moving his HQ's position. You have been tasked to take control of a number of three vehicles types, two planes and a tank, each with their own strengths and weaknesses to be considered as you attack the enemy. You are also equipped with a radar to show your position on the area, and once the bunkers are destroyed then the Commanders location will be shown.

War Play is a shooter that is viewed from a elevated angle with the screen scrolling in multiple directions when your vehicle moves. You must move about the area shooting enemy vehicles and buildings while avoiding being hit by the enemy or you lose that vehicle when it is destroyed. While the tank only moves along the ground and shoot forward, the two planes can be used to bomb buildings and vehicles. The altitude can also be increased or decreased but fly too low and that plane is lost if it hits an obstacle. Once all your vehicles have been destroyed then it is game over. Two players are able to play and they both play on the same side, with each player taking it in turns to attack the enemy when the other player loses a vehicle. There are three skill levels to choose from (easy, medium, hard) and these adjust the control of each of your vehicles.

It doesn't feature the questing and RPG aspects of the other title and is instead a pure strategy game. The player controls the forces of good in the War of the Ring from J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings. The game begins with the Fellowship of the Ring just having formed in Rivendell and the hobbit Frodo Baggins carrying the One Ring. The ultimate goal of the game is to get the ring bearer to the cracks of Mount Doom to destroy the ring. The game is lost if the ring bearer is killed or corrupted by the ring's influence or if Sauron's forces capture the city of Minas Tirith. War in Middle Earth is a real-time strategy game released for the ZX Spectrum, MSX, Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC, MS-DOS, Commodore Amiga, Apple IIGS, and Atari ST in 1988 by Australian company Melbourne House.</resource>

The gameplay involves guiding your character through a succession of 8 mazes. The standard bad guys are there, as are items to pick up including health and extra weapons. The game gives you one life, which represents the gradually declining amount of energy. You should get further on each go, with the difficulty curve being quite precise. As a bonus, an exclusive conversion of Druid is included.</resource>

    <resource id="43d297e7dd29ea95641be467918bcf69ad2ac953" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Warp! is an arcade racing game where the player, whose country's research center has just been raided by aliens, needs to rescue kidnapped scientists and recover stolen computers, weapons and microfilms. To pick up a scientist or an item the player has to stop and leave the car and move by foot to the item without getting killed by an alien. In the same way it's necessary to pick up fuel canisters to avoid running out of gas. Hitting any object or alien leads to a life being lost. In addition to fuel it is also necessary to collect energy vapor. As the energy is filled the vehicle is upgraded, first to a turbo racer and then to a jet fighter and finally to a combat tank. With the jet fighter it is possible to fire back at the aliens while the tank can run over road hazards.

    <resource id="45ad79577f087f7988b38471f8ecba2a050ae3a2" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">This is the sequel to the first part of the Warriors of Ras series, Dunzhin. All games in this series are early graphical Roguelikes. The story is quite simple: Enter the mystical monster-infested dungeon Kaiv, slay monsters and grab treasures. 

You explore the dungeon in a turn-based manner by entering commands in text adventure, like &amp;quot;MOVE NORTH&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;LIGHT TORCH&amp;quot;. The commands may be abbreviated by one or two letters. You can also move several squares at once (like &amp;quot;MOVE EAST 3&amp;quot;) to speed up your quest. Another very helpful command is &amp;quot;SPEED&amp;quot;, which makes the game's messages go by faster. Your progress is hindered by traps (acid pools, slimey floors etc., some of which you can escape by quickly pressing a key), thieves who rob you, random teleports and, of course, by a variety of 24 different monsters, ranging from simple Zombies, Wolves or Dwarves up to Wyverns and Vampires.

The combat system makes the Warriors of Ras series stand out from other roguelikes: Apart from your total hit points, you and the monsters also have hit points and armor for each body party separately. If the hit points of one body part reach zero, you're dead. Each attack must be directed to one of the body parts, some of which are easier to hit than others. You may also &amp;quot;AIM&amp;quot; a hit (which costs some time, but makes the attack more likely to hit) or &amp;quot;FORCE&amp;quot; an attack (this makes it more difficult to hit, but increases the damage). This and the body parts result in a quite tactical combat -- you have to guess or find out the weak parts of your opponent and choose the right way of attacking.

Kaiv extends the originally quite simple game of Dunzhin by adding a shop at the dungeon entrance where you can equip yourself. You now also have a bigger variety of items like torches, crosses (against Vampires) and mirrors (against Gorgons), and you can also find magical items: several rings, wands or potions that improve your magical or physical protection or increase you fighting skills. You also need to take enough food and drink with you to prevent dying from hunger or thirst.

The difficulty level of the game is quite high with new characters -- you often die just by being hit once by a low-level monster or by stepping into some trap. The game is generous in allowing you to save your progress at any time.</resource>

The moves are arranged logically, and reverse depending on the character's facing direction, similarly to the Exploding Fist games.</resource>

The object of the game is to fill in the missing letters of an incomplete word. On each round a word will appear at the top of the screen with several letters missing. The word will slowly begin moving towards the bottom of the screen and along the bottom of the screen is the complete alphabet. The player needs to select the letters that are missing from the word before time runs out and the word reaches the bottom of the screen. Successfully completing a word earns points, but if the word reaches the bottom of the screen then the player loses a life. The game ends when all five lives are lost.</resource>

Although you're racing against the other cars, you must make each checkpoint in the required amount of time in order to complete the game. The lap is split into three sections, so the fourth section is identical to the first, the fifth to the second, and so on. 

As the game goes on, the bonus time offered for each section drops, so you have to drive better as the game goes on to stay in. Night is represented as well, with everything darkened and the need for headlights. The circuit features barriers and trackside trees, so avoid contact with these, and try not to stray onto the grass as this slows you down.</resource>

The only way to rid yourself of the curse is to kill all the relatives of those who inflicted it. The more you kill, the more the police want to capture and jail you, but with the right equipment you can get out and continue your murderous rampage.

The game is an arcade adventure viewed at an angle. Collect as many objects as you can from people, including Underground tickets to get around London more quickly, torches and manhole cover removers to access and function in dark areas, and bandages to repair shot wounds. These objects can be stored for later use, even inside your jail cell.</resource>

    <resource id="54f839d8f1b2dfabc54e6bf8ad43bc1d471fb688" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">The story began years ago on the campus of a large university. You were a first-year student who spent more time learning how to sufi dance with a local whirling dirvish than studying. Your brother, while always a bit more clumsy and scatter-brained than you, somehow managed to graduate with a doctorate and was immediately offered a research position in the archeology department.

Trouble began when your brother returned from a year-long research expedition in the rain forests of South America. Not only did he return without any of the tools he'd borrowed from the university, but he had no notes documenting how he had spent his year. Out of concern for your brother's future and intrigued by his repeated mumbling about priceless ancient artifacts, you decide to retrace his steps.</resource>

The game is a 1st person shooter with the whole embassy building on the screen. There are a number of windows and terrorists or hostages will slide past the various windows in a different colour top. As the people appear in the windows you are told what colour the terrorists are wearing and these have to be shot by moving a cross-hair and pressing fire.

You have only six shots and when these run out then you must move to a cross-hair in the bottom left and shoot it to reload your gun. For every terrorist shot you receive a merit and collect enough before the time runs out and you are promoted. Shoot a hostage though then you are demoted and if you are demoted from Private or let the time run out then it is game over. During the game the colour of the terrorists can also change to a different colour.</resource>

You are armed with a rifle (activated by a short tap of the fire button) and five grenades (used via a longer press), and must not only kill off the enemy forces, but also rescue your comrades who have been tied to trees along the way. You begin at the bottom of the first screen and slowly make your way upwards; enemies pop up from all sides, walking around and shooting, and you have to dodge their shots while trying to shoot them yourself. The foes make good use of the decoy opportunities of the terrain, and you must do the same to have a chance. The levels include rivers with narrow bridges, potholes, and train-lines.

Extra supplies are dropped in as you progress through the game, as are extra lives in addition to your starting 5.</resource>

The game is flick-screen and viewed from the side as you move left or right on top of the rollercoaster. Below the rollercoaster is a scanner and this shows your position, position of the bomber and the position of a bomb. When a bomb is placed it moves upwards, bounces off the top of the screen and moves downwards and if it hits the track then you lose one of three lives. You have to run along the track to the correct part of the coaster and touch the bomb. Once you stop enough bombs then you move to the next level.</resource>

It is very similar to offerings like Winter Games from Epyx.

In Downhill skiing, you must avoid the obstacles and make it to the bottom of the hill, by swerving left and right and adjusting your speed by pushing the joystick forward and back. The Slalom is similar, involving skiing around flags.

In the ski jump, you must position the skis for a proper landing. In the bobsled event, you must carefully control the angles so your bobsled doesn't flip. The Biathlon event combines skiing to shooting ranges and shooting the targets archery-style.</resource>

Wizard Willy is an action game with platform elements. Willy can fire lightning bolts at the many enemies who intervene. The enemies are dangerous to touch, but don't fire back until later levels. Four icons are available to collect. One kills all monsters in the area, another gives an extra life, the third restores Willy to full strength at his current life, and the last restocks his lightning bolts. The levels incorporate forests (which include climbable trees), dungeons, stairways and fortresses.</resource>

The creatures wander about at various speeds, may shoot darts at the player, and some even have the ability to disappear temporarily. At the bottom of the screen the player has a radar which can be used to locate creatures that are invisible.</resource>

The game is viewed slightly top-down, with indoor rooms bordered by line drawn vectors rather than the fuller jungle graphics.

The pace of the game is quite fast, and the challenge of the action elements is increased by not having infinite weaponry. The route through the game is non-linear, with multiple exits and secret rooms commonplace. Although the screens always contain a particular area, rather than the sections of different areas viewed in Atic Atac (which meant that you'd often have to work out how to reach some sections via other screens), a river is a central aspect of the layout, and delimits some sections of the screens.</resource>

It is an early example of an expansion pack, requiring the player to have the original Wizardry installed to play. It uses the same engine and spells, but is scaled for importing existing characters rather than creating a new party. Players explore a 3D wire frame maze searching for a key item, the Staff of Gnilda, required to complete the game. The player creates a party of up to 6 characters of various classes, and then gain experience points by fighting random encounters. The maze has many hidden doors and secrets, so the player is encouraged to map out each floor on graph paper to find their way.</resource>

You see, when he goes through the exotic locations, he has to come face to face with its inhabitants, like bees, spiders, snakes, coal-kids, frogs, bats, snails, coyotes, and octopuses, to name a few. The hatchet is Tom-Tom's only line of defense against these menaces.</resource>

    <resource id="7e2ddb94367fd4efbf3f3e2ac520b5f167436fd4" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">In World Championship Boxing Manager the player can develop the careers of aspiring heavyweight boxers. The option are selected through an icon-based system, representing the manager's office.

Training the boxers involves deciding which areas they should work on, considering their strengths and weaknesses and any damage inflicted in previous fights, and those of their next opponent. There are 97 of these in the game, so reaching the top of the rankings will take about 15-20 fights. Choosing a beatable opponent who can get the fight as high up the Friday Night bill as possible, as well as negotiating the best financial deal and a mutually agreeable dare, are the main considerations.

Two different governing bodies are included in the game, each with subtly different rules. A fight in one set of rules won't be viewed quite as significantly by the other.

The matches are presented from the commentary box, with the two expert analysts exchanging textual descriptions of the key punches, and who is dong the best (a clue to how any judges' decision would go). Before and during the fights the player can instruct the boxer as to what tactics to adopt.</resource>

Once you pick your team you can also select which players you want on the field, so that you can round out the team's strengths and weaknesses. Also provided are modes for single exhibition matches, either against the computer or against a friend.

The action is viewed from above with large player sprites. Violent play is encouraged as there are no free kicks. The gameplay is rather simple: you can only control the player closest to the ball, and many soccer rules (such as penalty flags and offsides) are missing.</resource>

Through five levels, you have to shoot countless enemies, complete with the obligatory mid-level and end-level bosses. The most innovative part of this game comes after a level when you get to purchase new weapons - instead of simply buying upgrades, you can customize your ship by placing your new weapons anywhere on it.</resource>

The game is actually nothing like its sequel, with completely different control scheme and gameplay. The plot overlaps however, with the Xenites making their first attempt to control the galaxy.

Xenon is essentially an overhead shooter, where the player controls the ship and moves around the screen. However, the difference between Xenon and its sequel is that here the player actually controls the movement of the playfield (up or down) by simply moving the ship in the direction of choice. To do this in the sequel, players need to slam your ship against the bottom of the screen and pull back on the stick in order to reverse-scroll the playfield.

It also features a 3D playfield (some enemies, for example, will be mounted on hills of sort, where players can't shoot them). To combat these the player can transform its tank into a plane. The game then switches to the more familiar gameplay style as seen in other vertically scrolling shooters. The plane has to transform back into a tank again to combat most ground units.

In Xenon, upgrades are taken from destroyed enemies.</resource>

A distress call is received from space stations orbiting your homeworld, then silence.  A single ship escapes, piloted by a battered man who tells the tale of pods that hatch into acid-spitting Xenos.

A small band of engineers has been dispatched to combat the Xeno threat before it takes over all the space stations and, eventually, your homeworld.  Assemble your band of engineers and fight the Xenos on each station, striving to either clear it or abandon it.  You start out with a standard issue laser, but can pick up additiona weapons as you find them, including Phasers, Lightning Rifles, Poofer guns, and bombs.

Xenophobe was originally an arcade coin-op by Bally/Midway, released in 1987.  Gameplay premise and setting is heavily inspired/influenced by the movie Aliens.</resource>

Of course this involves fighting a wide range of opponents in a traditional one-on-one 2D environment.  Oolong has a wide range of attacks he can use to lower his opponent's life bar, including traditional punching and kicking attacks as well as jumping ones.  Opponents are well armed with unique weapons and attacks, so Oolong's task won't be easy.</resource>

Yogi must travel across Yellowstone Park to rescue his friend Boo-Boo, who has been kidnapped. Travel through 198 screens to reach him, collecting six toffee apples en route - these are converted into a code which allows Boo-Boo to be rescued without his kidnapper raising a fuss.

The park scrolls sideways, with Yogi moving into and out of the layered screens. It contains animals who can harm you on contact, as well as black holes and water hazards. Contact with the park ranger or tourists is also forbidden. Yogi must watch his energy level, which is kept up by swiping fish and pick-a-nick baskets. Boo-Boo must be rescued before he and Yogi have to hibernate for the winter.</resource>

On one search, Yogi over hears an awful telephone conversation with Ranger Smith that the Park is closing and all animals must be caught and transferred to a zoo. Not wanting to live in a cage or enclosure, Yogi has decided to escape and thus the beginning of his adventure. You have to guide Yogi over six levels (ending in New York) keeping ahead of a tracker and his dog. You must complete each level in 2 minutes 40 seconds or it is game over. On the way there are obstacles like holes and water, as well as other characters to get in your way. Touching these loses one of three lives. Scattered over the levels are various food items which will give you 100 points as well as invisible ones giving 250 points. If you want a bigger score then on certain levels you can collect six items which reward you with 7500 points.</resource>

Defeat them with your arsenal of weapons which include explosive special abilities that spread out to each side - very efficient against heaps of smaller enemies.

Being a budget title and coming in relatively late in the C64 life cycle, it is known for its smoothly scrolling visuals and amazing soundtrack by Charles Deenen of Maniacs of Noise. It was also infamous for having a high difficulty, even for its time.</resource>

Stage two is a space shoot out against hordes of enemy aircraft - those you failed to destroy in the first part of the task. Complete this and you reach the final battle with Zaxxon, with the game looping with increased difficulty if you can survive the first time.

This is where the Timelords have established their base from which they intend to dominate this planetary system. You must navigate the caves and undermine their forces! In this game the player controls a zeppelin traveling through a cave system. The goal is to survive the cave defenses, acquire a TNT bomb, and unlock access to the chamber where the bomb can be detonated. The zeppelin is capable of firing in all directions. The player has limited ability to control the advancement through the caves, as the screen constantly scrolls with directions shifting according to the cave layout. The caves have many defenses, from laser walls to falling rocks. Most of these can be disabled by shooting switches on the cave walls. In order to access the room where the bomb can be detonated, the player has to find a hamburger and use it to bribe the hamburger creature that blocks the entrance. The two-player mode has one player controlling the zeppelin movement, while the second player controls the guns.</resource>

The setting is Los Angeles which is made up of five side view screens which the player flies between. The blimp is moved around with joystick but the manoeuvrability is limited by its size as well as the gravity. There is no reverse so it needs to be turned around to change direction.

In total there are 48 people waiting to be rescued and they all need to be brought to the home base where a space ship is being built. It's important to pay attention to the fuel gauge and refuel before it gets too low. There are also obstacles such as clouds, bridges and buildings that have to be avoided since any crash will lead to all passengers getting killed and the player losing a life.</resource>

A coven of black magic masters has gained terrifying powers after removing the Signs of the Zodiac from the Time Vaults, leading to great confusion. The Signs of the Zodiac are guarded by demons and a lethal force field flows along the walls of the corridors. The player's objective is to kill the demons and recover the twelve signs and return them to the time vaults. There are four hundred corridors in total and enemies are continually multiplying. Any contact with either demons or walls will lead to a loss of life. Being on the move is important as it is not possible to shoot while standing still. Once all the signs have been collected the player will face Jemon, the most powerful of all the demons.</resource>

Whenever this pixel moves over the playfield, it leaves a line behind - and when the line becomes a closed form, it gets coloured. The goal is to colour 75% of the playfield; everything above gives bonus points for the high score list. Well, it is not that easy. White pixels fly around the field and touching them result in death; similarly deadly is going backwards on a line. At least the player has two tricks to help himself: he can change the direction of the white pixels by pressing a button (limited) and jail them when drawing a closed line around them. This is possible because the pixels are either confined to the coloured or uncoloured parts. After finishing a level a new one starts with three changes: one more white pixel, an extra life for the player and one additional usage of the &amp;quot;direction change&amp;quot; button.</resource>

The player steps into the deliberately vague role of an &amp;quot;adventurer&amp;quot;. The game begins near a white house in a small, self-contained area. Although the player is given little instruction, the house provides an obvious point of interest. When the player enters the house, it yields a number of intriguing objects: an ancient brass lantern, an empty trophy case, an intricately engraved sword, etc. Beneath the rug a trap door leads down into a dark dungeon. But what initially appears to be a dungeon is actually one of several entrances to a vast subterranean land?the Great Underground Empire. The player soon encounters dangerous creatures, including deadly grues, an axe-wielding troll, a giant cyclops and a nimble-fingered thief. The ultimate goal of Zork I is to collect the Twenty Treasures of Zork and install them in the trophy case. Finding the treasures requires solving a variety of puzzles such as the navigation of two brutal mazes and some intricate manipulations at Flood Control Dam #3.</resource>

The purpose of the game is not initially clear. The Wizard of Frobozz is soon introduced. The wizard was once a respected enchanter, but when his powers began to fade he was exiled by Dimwit Flathead. Now bordering on senility, the wizard is still a force to be reckoned with. Your goal, as you venture into the wizard's realm, is to avoid his capricious tricks and learn to control his magic. Like its predecessor, Zork II is essentially a treasure hunt. Unlike the previous game, the ten treasures are tied together by a crude plot. Finding the treasures does not end the game, nor are all the treasures needed to finish the game. Instead, the adventurer must figure out a way to use the treasures in order to reach the game's finale.</resource>

This computer version of Zorro is a strange beast, he can leap across buildings, fall 50 feet and land like a feather, with neither a scratch to his head or a crease in his cape. He can also perform masterful tricks, such as balancing a large plant pot on his head, while simultaneously climbing up a ladder.

Zorro has similar platform gameplay to the same company's Bruce Lee game, but with a slower pace and more puzzle elements. There are 20 different screens in the game, with The Ole Hotel screen being used continually throughout the game. The player must overcome various puzzles, including the branding of a bull and catapulting into the air via a conveniently left spring board and a dazed Garcia guard!</resource>

In a humorous twist, every creature in the game is named Zub, including the main character.

Zub must ride the intergalactic elevators to reach other planets and continue the search for the Eye. The worlds are very empty, featuring a few platforms and sparsely populated by dangerous monsters called Zubs. Zub must hop to the existing platforms, position them next to each other, and keep jumping and alternating between them to ascend to the top of the level and move to the next planet. The Zubs float around the scene following the hero, trying to touch and drain some of the health energy, and have to be killed with the laser gun.</resource>

Holding down the fire button will initiate your shield and make any Zulu who touches you disappear. The shield count decreases but when not in use increases.</resource>

Power-up tokens are offered for destroying some enemies, which can be used to obtain better weapons including ground-attack lasers, speed-ups and multiple bullets.

Extra lives are on offer as well; you start with three spaceships and get your first extra ship at 10,000 points, followed by another every 20,000 points.

Losing a life means being mercilessly returned to the beginning of the level, no matter how far you had already proceeded. The game has no ending; it simply loops back to the start if, by some miracle, you actually manage to finish all the levels with the few lives you're given.</resource>

The player can steer the ship left and right, and he can also control the forward speed, even bringing everything to a halt. There are enemies on the ground, such as tanks and turrets, and planes in the air. There are also hazards such as electrical currents that need to be avoided. To leave the planet the KEY icons on the right side of the screen need to be gathered to form a sequence. This is done by landing in bunkers marked with an I, which contains information about the planet. At the end of the stage four bunkers are shown and the player needs to choose the one that matches the key sequence to exit. Along the way there are also regular bunkers that repair the ship. Not every enemy hit is lethal, it fills up a damage bar on the right side of the screen. The player starts with three lives. The game can be played with up to eight players, taking turns.</resource>

To help you in your quest you have a truck carrying a rocket which you use to traverse the six levels of the city. To destroy the city you have to collect six pieces of a bomb to place on the lowest level which destroys the outer defences allowing you to shoot the inner defences. Your truck can travel over various rough terrains but some obstacles like gaps in the ground or water require blocks to be placed to allow you carry on moving. Here you can send the rocket to find and collect the blocks to place in your path. The rocket though has limited fuel and ammunition. A parachute is also needed to be found to allow the truck to drop through the holes to the next level of the city. To protect the city, the inhabitants have sent out various vehicles to destroy you as well as electrical discharges which need turning off by a control panel.</resource>

Your goal is to launch the Discovery, establish an orbit around the Earth, open the cargo bay doors and recover a satellite to perform repairs, and finally land the Discovery successfully, all while using as little fuel as possible. Each time the complete mission is accomplished, it will then repeat at a higher difficulty level (in the higher difficulty levels the satellite has a more erratic flight path). The game is played from a first person perspective in the space shuttle cockpit where you can control everything from the shuttles engines to cargo bay doors. When the game is over you will be given a ranking which is based on the number of successful dockings and the amount of fuel that was used. In addition to the full flight mode, two easier game variations (autosimulator and simulator mode) are included. The autosimulator mode is the easiest; the computer will control the flight (you can take over at any point you wish) and the controls are simplified. The simulation mode is closer to the full game, however you have an unlimited amount of fuel so there is no time pressure, and the computer will help compensate for inaccurate maneuvering.</resource>

But now nature itself seems to be attacking the land of Llylgamyn, as earthquakes and tidal waves ravage the land. The Sages believe the Orb of Scrying is the city's salvation, but it is guarded by the dragon L'kbreth. A band of explorers must once again venture forth in search of the Orb. Legacy of Llylgamyn is the third entry in the Wizardry series. Like its predecessors, it is a first-person dungeon-crawling role-playing game in which the player assembles a party of up to six characters and explores a large maze-like dungeon, fighting randomly appearing enemies in turn-based combat and occasionally returning to the game's only town to rest, buy supplies, and outfit the characters. Characters must be imported from either the first or the second game. Character classes, combat system, and overall gameplay mechanics are very similar to those of the two previous games. Good, evil and neutral alignment, however, plays a larger role. While the first level of the dungeon is accessible to everyone, the other five levels impose alignment restrictions, requiring the party either to have at least one good or bad character, or contain no neutral characters.</resource>

    <resource id="5ec9bcb816543098187c6314dbba88b528e6c1d4" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">In Wizball the player takes the role of the friendly wizard Wiz who can turn himself into a green ball that is able to defend his world against the color-sucking enemies who have turned his once brightly colored Wizworld into a drab planet. With his trusty feline companion Catelite, the wizard will restore the colors to the world by retrieving them from defeated enemies.

The player starts out as a bouncing green ball that can shoot and be put into more or less heavy rotation to move slowly or faster, physically correct through the side-scrolling levels. The first task is to upgrade the ball by shooting the first non-moving enemies, and collect the green bubbles that are left by them. In order to stand a chance against the following moving enemy waves, some upgrades are a must. First and foremost, complete control over the ball should be activated (i.e. flying through the levels), a shield sheltering the top and bottom of the player's should be acquired, and two-way fire (left/right) should be obtained.

But the extra needed to advance in Wizball is your friend Catelite who will, once summoned, take the form of a small green satellite that will imitate the ball's movement, or can be directly controlled by the player. Besides upping Wiz' fire power, Catelite is able to collect paint drops left by a certain kind of defeated enemies until the respective color pot is filled up. There's three colors available (red, green and blue), and several different combinations of them must be collected to complete a level and restore it to former colorfulness. Every color combination collected will send Wiz to a bonus stage, then to his laboratory where one of the power-ups can be made permanently.

The game also features a bunch of multi-player modes, there's even a two-player cooperative mode amongst them.</resource>

The Zoids take the shapes of dots which change into other shapes, and depending on the time it has been on screen it requires a certain amount of hits. You can move your ship in multiple directions but you can only point and fire to the right. You have an energy level which decreases when you fire you laser but energy packets in the shape of spacemen appear and can be collected to increase your energy. If you touch a Zoid then you are killed and you lose one of three lives and a joystick is used to control your ship.</resource>

Your character is the Ultimate Wizard. You must face dark enemies as you move through the bricks, ladders, staircases of the game. Cast spells to destroy them, or otherwise avoid them using levitation arrows or other magic. When you Wizard finds the key and places it in the keyhole, he is finished for that level, but soon the next level will appear while sounds play as the level materializes in front of the player.</resource>

You are trapped inside one of 26 mazes (composed of 90-degree direction changes) and must find the exit. The game records how many movement units you use up, and saves the best scores to disk. Up to nine in-progress games can also be saved.

You have a compass and a map-making kit, enabling the game to automatically map the areas you explore. These can be stolen by the Cleptangle beast, but you can chase him to get them back. 

You can't push against the wind without finding a special way of overcoming it. Fireflies automatically move with the wind, and can serve as a clue to its direction.</resource>
