The games included are:
The player is a construction worker trying to get falling tools with a bucket. He must get as many as he can until the time runs out.
2. The player is what looks like an alien machine, side scrolling over a planet collecting food and avoiding obstacles such as bombs. He must get as many as he can until the time runs out.
3. A skateboarding side scrolling game: the player must run as far as you he while avoiding obstacles such as holes in the street, until the time runs out.
4. The player is what seems to be a flea, running and jumping while the screen scrolls over a mountain of blocks, avoiding to get stuck behind the hills.
5. The player is a mouse trying to catch the cheese pieces that fall from the shelves. In order to do so, he can jump (by pressing button 1), and he must get as many as he can until the time runs out.
6. The player is a diver on a sunken ship, getting coins which fall from above, while avoiding being caught by a shark. He must get as many as he can until the time runs out.
7. A motocross racing game: the player must run down the road while avoiding obstacles trying to reach the next checkpoint before the time runs out.
8. An arcade racing game: the player must run down the street while avoiding getting hit by the other cars, until the time runs out.
9. The player is a little Brazilian Indian sailing his boat on a river, while avoiding obstacles such as rocks and arrows. He must get as far as he can until the time runs out.
10. A helicopter combat game. The player must shoot (by pressing button 1) the enemy helicopter as much as he can, avoiding to get hit, until the time runs out.
11. The player is a frog trying to catch the insects that fall from the sky. He must get as many as he can until the time runs out, while jumping from one victoria amazonica to another. He must project his tong (by pressing the button 1) in order to get the insects.
12. A classic space shooter. Fly your spaceship while the screen scrolls down, avoiding obstacles and shooting as many spaceships as he can, until the time runs out.
13. A side scrolling flight shooter. The player must shoot (by pressing button 1) as many balloons as he can while avoiding getting hit by other planes, until the time runs out.
14. A roller skating side scrolling game: the player must run as far as you he while avoiding obstacles such as logs in the street, until the time runs out.
15. A pong game with a twist: the player is a cooker trying to hit mini-pizzas inside an oven. The pizzas will bounce back if they don't get inside the oven. The player has 5 mini-pizzas and must try to hit as many as he can until the time runs out.
16. The player is a insecticide can trying to kill the insects that fall from the roof. He must kill as many as he can until the time runs out by  shooting insecticide (by pressing the button 1) at them.
17. In this side scrolling game, the player is a boy who must run all the way right while shooting (by pressing button 1) other boys with his water gun, avoiding to get hit by them, before the time runs out. He must shoot as many boys as he can.
18. A skiing game: the player must race down the mountain while avoiding obstacles trying to reach the next checkpoint before the time runs out.
19. The player controls a police car running up the screen, while avoiding getting hit by other cars. He must get as far as he can, until the time runs out.
20. Another pong game: this time the player is at a squash court. He must try to hit the ball as much as he can until the time runs out. He has 3 balls.

In order to win, the player must score a certain amount of points in each game (which vary from game to game). If the player scores less the specified amount, he loses. In the &amp;quot;catch the object&amp;quot; and shooter games (1, 2, 5, 6, 10, 11, 12, 13, 16 and 17), points are earned by catching or shooting objects. In racing games (3, 7, 8, 9, 14, 18 and 19), points are earned by the distance ran. In game 15 points are earned by hitting the oven; in game 20, by number of hits in the ball. In these games (15 and 20), the player can loose if he misses all his balls/pizzas. In game 4 no points are earned at all, and you'll loose if the character gets stuck and the screen scrolls over him.

The game has only two songs, one played at the title screen, the other played during all gameplay. All the text in the game is in Portuguese.</resource>

Despite its title, it does not accurately reflect the team roster of the 1994 World Cup: there is, for example, no Brazil among the 24 teams available for selection. There is also no possibility to actually play through the competition; players can only opt to participate in a single match (against each other or computer AI) or a series of penalty kicks. There are no individual player statistics, substitutions, or any other features beyond playing the match itself. Active team members are selected automatically, and the player can only pass, kick, or perform a tackle when playing in defense.</resource>

It's white knuckle aerial combat simulation, combining the exhilaration of flight with the gut-wrenching pressure of enemy confrontation. During World War II, Mosquitos downed 659 enemy aircraft and 500 V-Buzz Bombs. Your only allies are your wits, your weapons and your radar. Are you equal to the challenge? Down the Nazi bombers, sink de U-boats, outrun the V-Buzz Bombs and stop the enemy trains to release the POWs. Should you fly around a storm or around? Navigate carefully, consult your intelligence reports and maps to make a decision. Choose your weapons and fuel wisely - once your're on a mission, there's no going back. Select one mission or any combination. If you complete all four successfully - and make it back alive - you'll become the most distinguished flight veteran of World War II - the Ace of Aces!</resource>

You are quite vulnerable to attack at first, but power ups come in the form of a Sega van which you have to dock with. The first time you dock you get double fire, the second time gives you a rocket, the third gives a rear force field and the fourth invulnerablility.

By destroying cars and bikes that appear on your way, you can collect A-F letters. Collecting A through to D allows you change into a sportscar which is less vulnerable to attack, but not as nimble. Collect all the letters in order to be able to transform into a high tech plane. This is the final stage of one of the five missions. Only the high tech plane can guide you to your destination in which your main target is hiding.

There is also time limit in which you have to complete the mission. It is advisable to transform into the high tech plane as fast as it is possible.

Picking up flags gives you bonus points with 10,000 points gaining you an extra life.</resource>

The player takes the role of Gomez who searches for his missing family members. To find them he has to explore six different parts of the mansion, e.g. the woods, which are basic platform levels: the player moves from left to right while jumping a lot and avoiding enemies. Some of them can be dispatched of by a jump on their heads. 

The main difference to the other versions of this game is a unique level design. There is also a life meter which allows to get hit more often before dying.</resource>

The goal is simple: use your F-14 Tomcat and shoot as many enemies as you can. This aircraft has two weapons: lock-on missiles and Vulcan cannons (basically machine guns). In some versions there is an option to let the cannons shoot automatically all the time.

The game is viewed from behind the plane with you fighting wave after wave of enemy fighters. But at heart it offers the usual shooter mechanics, meaning you spend most of your time dodging and shooting. Sometimes you come across a friendly supply plane and if you dock with it you can replenish your missiles.</resource>

The player controls Aladdin, making his way through a variety of locations, including the streets of Agrabah, the Cave of Wonders, the Sultan's palace and more. Gameplay takes several different forms: some levels are chases, where Aladdin runs automatically, but must be made to jump over chasms or rolling rocks and barrels, evade falling objects and avoid getting caught by a guard. Other levels are platforming affairs: Aladdin must run, jump and climb, find keys or switches to open doors while searching for the exit. Rocks can be collected and be thrown to dispatch enemies or hit buttons otherwise out of reach. Finally, there are also several magic carpet rides in the game, in which the level scrolls automatically and the player must make sure to avoid any obstacles in the way.

Once again you play Alex, whose mission is to run through each location, knocking down enemies, and obtain the six miracle balls. These balls are hidden inside the strangest places like golden eggs, the Fantazy Zone ship out of action, clamshells, Christmas presents, pumpkins, and desk bells.

Alex must then venture in outer space to defeat the evil Ziggurat. Locations include Toy World, Machine World, the World of Make Believe, Water World, and Monster World. You will even tour through the giant's body. Once you obtained the six miracle balls, you have to run through all the locations again, but these repeated locations introduce new enemies. 

With all the locations, you're under a time limit, and as usual, if the time expires, you lose a life. Alex starts the game with nothing, but during the game, he can collect power-ups that give him extra time, and allow him to shoot enemies or jump higher.

    <resource id="bc02ecf8ecd40efb6e05929a7212fa422beb4282" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Many centuries ago, on the planet Aries, there lived a boy called Alex Kidd. For seven years, he lived on Mt. Eternal studying Shellcore, an ancient art that makes one strong enough to break rocks into pieces. As he was leaving the mountain one day to travel to his spiritual homeland, a dying man told him that the peaceful city of Radactian was in grave danger. Before taking his last breath, the man gave Alex a piece of a map and a medallion made of Sun Stone.

There are eleven locations in which Alex must explore, each of them has its own unique dangers. In each location, Alex can collect bags of coins, which can be used to buy items at the shop and are used to help Alex get through each location (eg: motorcycle, peticopter, power bracelet, etc.) There are also traps that Alex must avoid like the ghost that chases him. He can also collect the Telepathy Ball that will help him read people's minds.

Later, Alex learns that in order to save Radactian from destruction, he must first defeat Janken the Great, Emperor of the planet Janbarik (he got his name from his expertise at the game of Janken -- or what people call &amp;quot;scissors, paper, stone&amp;quot; in the Western World. Janken has sent his henceman all over Radactian to prepare the game for Alex as he passes by them. In order to get past them, Alex must win three times at Janken. If he loses, he is turned to stone and vanished from Radactian forever. Later on in the game, Alex must play with the same henceman, but only this time, when Alex wins, they decide to play dirty.

Alex uses his fists to wipe out some of Janken's enemies such as birds, sea horses, bats, monkeys, frogs, and a few others. If his quest to save Radactian from the evil hands of Janken becomes difficult, he can instead use the power bracelet to perform the &amp;quot;Shocking Waves of Destruction&amp;quot;, an ancient trick in the art of Shellcore.

Before Alex comes face-to-face with Janken, he should rescue his brother, Egle, from imprisonment, and get the letter and two medallions.</resource>

The Dark Ninja, whom was banished 10,000 years ago, has returned to rule Miracle World. He also takes young Alex's girlfriend and use her as a sacrifice. To help Alex defeat the Dark Ninja and rescue his girlfriend, a god enters Alex's body, causing Alex to become a ninja master.

There are four rounds, with three levels each, and has Alex travel through locations like office blocks, construction sites, shipyards, and jungles. He must go through each level defeating ninjas and other wildlife. In the last levels, he must defeat bosses including Kabuto, Heli, Robster, and Hanzo. To survive some levels, you must learn the secret jumping technique, described on page eight of the game's instruction manual. You start the game with three lives and are presented with an energy bar with three units, but you'll lose one if an enemy touches you. Furthermore, If you lose all three energy units, you lose a life, and if you lose all three lives, the game is over.

Additional energy units can be obtained by collecting hearts that can be found by breaking treasure chests. The maximum units you can get is six. From there, the heart is replaced by a mini-Alex. Collect this and you've earned yourself an extra life. You'll get hearts if you have less than six units. 

You can also get weapons like spears and power swords by breaking these treasure cheats. However, if you're lucky, you can obtain a Tornado icon, letting you transform into a tornado while mini-Tornados whirl around the screen, seeking enemies. This allows you to either go left or right so your enemies get sucked in and are knocked out.</resource>

Enemies (thieves) spawn from the top of the playfield attempt to take the bags of money from the bottom of the screen to their hideout. It's your job to reclaim any stolen goods and defeat the 40 thieves. Three of the thieves (blue, green and white) can be crushed by Ali Baba simply by colliding into them. The red &amp;quot;captain thief&amp;quot; will always pursue Ali Baba and cannot be stopped.

Occasionally a number of &amp;quot;?&amp;quot; tiles will appear in the centre of the stage, changing the style of gameplay. Sometimes the top section of the screen will open up, allowing Ali Baba to reclaim some of the items stored in the thief's hideout, while others will make Ali Baba (or the red thief) double in size, making them more of a threat.</resource>

The plot of the movie picks up directly after the end of Aliens. Ellen Ripley, the main character of the Alien series, is in cryo-sleep aboard the space ship Sulaco. Unfortunately, an alien or two has stowed away on the Sulaco, and wreaked havoc within the ship.  Thus, it crash lands on the prison colony planet Fiorina 161.  Ripley and the unarmed prisoners have to figure out a way to survive the aliens terrorizing the colony until help arrives.

The game play of the various Alien³ conversions varies from platform to platform. The Genesis Alien³ game is a side-scrolling action game with large maze-like levels. In each level, you have to rescue all the trapped prisoners and then make your way to the exit, all while surviving multiple alien attacks.

The Busters consist of Karla, Gordon, and Scooter. Each one of them have their own weapons and special attacks.

When you start the game, you can select any one of these characters to play as. There are six missions to complete (eight in the Genesis version) with several stages, and each mission has you blasting aliens all the way to the end, from the streets to the mother ship where you'll meet the mother of all aliens. Unfortunately, blasting these aliens will not be an easy task, as they get tougher in every mission, and are capable of hiding into objects such as plants, postboxes, trashcans, drums, and several others. Each mission has an objective such as rescuing people destroying an UFO.

When you deal with a few aliens, flying heads will appear, which you can shoot to collect life or energy (by the way, life is important to you, since if yours get empty, you're dead). However, rather than using your ordinary weapons, you can use the special attacks that are enough to kill aliens you currently see. These types of attack vary depending on the character you choose at the start of the game. For instance, Gordon summons a U.S. Air Force Jet that drop bombs across the street, while Scooter is able to teleport out of his present location, and leave a series of bombs that will blow up aliens on sight, he will then re-appear. However, using your character's special attack uses up a lot of energy, and if you have little or no energy, you can't use it.

At the end of some missions is an alien boss, which you must destroy in order to complete the mission. Also, at the end of every one, you have to enter buildings where you participate in a shooting gallery. The object is to kill aliens popping up from several locations with the building. 

You can play Alien Storm by yourself, or with another person.</resource>

With a scenery inspired by Ancient Greece, you have to fight hordes of undead and demons, with a boss at the end of each level until you meet the god Neff, who holds the girl captive.

The title refers to your shapeshifting abilities. In this platformer, you can collect spirit balls by defeating two-headed wolves, allowing you to mutate into different beasts such as a werewolf, a dragon, a tiger, a bear and others depending on the version. Each form, tied to a level, comes with special abilities such as flight and powerful attacks, easily superseding the basic set of punches and kicks in your human form.

The game can be played in singleplayer mode, or in same-screen multiplayer co-op mode.</resource>

There are four modes in the game: Exhibition, Tournament, Watch Mode, and finally a Home Run Contest. In the Watch Mode the computer just plays against itself, and in Tournament Mode you compete against the computer. The other two modes can be played against computer or a human opponent as well.

You can choose Major League Baseball teams in all of those modes. During the game, the player controls the pitcher and the batter from a third-person view; the view changes to top-down after a strike by a batter, so that the player can view a large part of the field. Events such as injuries or cheerleader performances are graphically shown in the game.</resource>

Gameplay features all the usual moves: smashes, passing shots, volleys and all kinds of backhand and forehand plays, but unlike other games, precise positioning and timing are crucial to avoid hitting the ball outside the court, swinging the racket into thin air or more embarrassing, let the ball hit you on the head.
Three courts are available: Grass, Clay and Indoor (Sega versions  add a fourth, Hard), but the differences between them are minimal. Game modes change according to the version, with the 16-bit versions including a &amp;quot;Skins&amp;quot; game, where each point is worth a sum of money based on the number of times the ball was hit.</resource>

Such is his power that no living creature dares to cross paths with him. But the legendary warrior Rygar rises from his grave to restore peace and justice. Armed with his famed weapon Diskarmor, Rygar begins to traverse the vast lands that lead to the lair of the demon, as his minions are trying in vain to stop him...

Originally released on the arcades, Rygar is a side-scrolling action game. The player controls the titular hero, advancing through stages populated by hostile creatures. Beside the Diskarmor, a weapon that looks like a shield with a chain attached to it, the hero can use a variety of other weapons, including projectiles that can be fired in four directions. Various &amp;quot;powers&amp;quot; are scattered through the levels and can be collected. The effects of these powers include increasing the fire power of the equipped weapon, adding time to the clock, temporary invisibility, extra points, etc.</resource>

The robots robbed them of their weapons, and occupied various military bases and factories. The war robots that were manufactured there murdered men one after another, and the survivors organized a resistance and went into a full-scale offensive against the enemy's army. You are Joe, and you swear that nothing can stop you from destroying the control system which forces the robots to kill.

Assault City is a one-player shooter. At the beginning of the game, you participate in a little shooting practice, where you must shoot squares that contains pictures of robots, and avoid shooting squares that contains pictures of humans. In the levels that follow the shooting range, you must kill robots that appear and attack you. If you are hit by these robots, some of your energy will be lost. Occasionally, shooting the power-ups that appear will result in more weapon power or more life. At the end of each level, you need to defeat a boss in order to proceed to the next level. The game ends when you lose all of your energy. You have unlimited continues, however.

Assault City comes in two flavors: the control pad version, as well as a Light Phaser version.</resource>

It is 50 B.C., and the entire Gaul (today's France) is conquered by the Romans. Only one village still remains independent, thanks to the incredible powers of its two great warriors, Asterix and Obelix. In the game, they must first of all liberate the village Orvio and rescue their friend Dogmatix.

You can play as either Asterix or Obelix. You make your way through platform levels, fighting enemies by punching them, and jumping to access higher ares or to avoid falling down. There are also some items you can collect, such as bombs, with which you can overcome obstacles and advance in the game.

In this side-scrolling action game, the player can choose to play either Astérix or Obelix at the start of each one of the six levels. Although the main setting of each level is the same to both characters (forests, caves, deserts, underwater stages, waterfalls and such) the level design for each one may vary. In two player mode (Master System version), players will take turns playing as Astérix and Obelix. Both characters jump (by pressing button 2), punch enemies and break blocks (by pressing button 1). Astérix can run can run (by pressing and holding button 1 while moving) and double jump (by pressing 2 in the middle of a jump). Obélix is stronger and can break several bricks in a row when jumping over them (pressing 1 while jumping), and can also slide down hills (by pressing down at them).

Astérix can get some potions (thrown by pressing up and 1), which can break rocks, kill or shrink enemies. Obelix can get miniature menhirs which can be thrown (by pressing up and 1) against enemies. Both characters can also get bones throughout the game, granting access to bonus stages where the player controls Dogmatix. Some levels also involve minor puzzle solving, like pushing switches or moving rock blocks.

Your only weapon are bullets as your only defense, but if you shoot the flashing red pieces on the terrain, chances are that a green ship will approach you, and if you collect this ship, your weapons will be upgraded so that you shoot a laser beam instead. Keep collecting ships and you can shoot up to three laser beams at once. 

At the end of each zone, you will come across a boss that takes multiple hits to kill. If you manage to conquer all three zones, you are back to where you started. The whole point of this game is to earn as many points you can without losing all of your lives.</resource>

As Aventuras da TV Colosso (which means &amp;quot;The Adventures of TV Colosso&amp;quot;) is a modified version of Astérix and the Secret Mission, with Astérix and Obelix replaced by Gilmar and Priscila, characters from a Brazilian TV puppet show, popular during the early 90's.

As before, the action is viewed from within the cockpit, but depicted using sprites rather than polygons. 

There are three main modes:

1. Senna GP: Features three non-championship circuits with a preliminary race followed by three laps. 

2. World Championship: The full 16-race championship. There are two modes in the championship mode that affect how the game is played. Beginner is a regular season, with the same difficulty level as the remaining modes, and cars have roughly the same power. Each race has three laps. In Master things get a twist. There are five groups of cars, and the player starts on the lowly competitive SERGA team. To climb the ranks and get a chance of claim the title the player must challenge a driver from other team and beat him to the top spot. The winner of this particular race gets (or holds) the fastest car. Races are also longer in this mode, and pit-stops are activated, required if the player knocks on too many objects or other cars frequently. 

3. Free Practice: This allows the player to drive on any race without caring for championship positions. There are two options in Free Practice: Free Run is just the player against the clock and Image Training is a race, but instead of having to quality and then run the three laps, the player can set the number of laps (between one and six), starting position and the condition of the track (dry or wet, only on some circuits).

While each mode presents it's own variations, the core of each race is the same: Along controller setup options, the player can choose between an Automatic or Manual with 4 or 7 speeds gearbox, and races against 16 drivers. The car can be instantly wrecked if it goes on top speed against a roadside object.</resource>

More often than not, you must jump over water, and along the way, you can get power-ups such as more energy, more time, and jets that lets you fly through the scene, but only if you perform a wheelie can you get these power-ups.

Based on the second installment of the popular Hollywood series Back to the Future, this movie conversion has Marty McFly and Doc Brown travel through time to stop their arch-rival Biff from changing the future. The game consists of five parts, each inspired by one of the movie's most memorable scenes:

1. Hoverboard Chase: A Paperboy clone without newspapers, but with isometric levels and lots of enemies to dodge.
2. Jennifer Rescue: Guide Marty's girlfriend Jennifer out of the house without her meeting one of the four family members. Open and close doors to make the persons go from one room to the next in this top-down puzzle sequence.
3. Beat Biff: A side-scrolling beat-em-up sequence in the tradition of Double Dragon. Fight your way through a grim 1985 by jumping, hitting and kicking at Biff's lackeys.
4. Band Puzzle: Rearrange the mixed-up parts of an animated picture of the school band in this sliding block puzzle. The clock is ticking.
5. Hoverboard Chase 2: Another hoverboard sequence, similar to the first one, only this time set in 1955.</resource>

Marty McFly and Doc Brown have traveled back through time to the year 1885 - and they're soon deep in trouble when they face &amp;quot;Mad Dog&amp;quot; Tannen's gang and have to find a way to return to the present. This game takes four scenes from the Hollywood movie Back to the Future III and turns them into arcade sequences:

1. Buckboard Chase: Doc Brown goes horseback in an attempt to save Hill Valley's lovely school teacher Clara. This game of quick ducking, jumping and shooting alternates between a side-scrolling and a top-down perspective.

2. Shooting Gallery: The name says it all. A classic game of aim-and-shoot, spiced up by hidden extras and bonus targets.

3. Pie Throwing: Meet the Mad Dog gang. They have guns, and you have... cream pies. It's an isometric version of the shooting gallery, only with ammo. And the targets shoot back.

4. The Train: Basically a side-scrolling beat-em-up on train wagons with some ducking and jumping. Get rid of the mechanics and collect speed logs to push the engine to a magic 88 mph.</resource>

But the King says she already has too many, and she can't take care of so many animals. Thus the Minister purposes a contest of skill and daring to select the Royal Zookeeper. Master Piggy then sends his pupil, Polly, to participate in the contest.

Baku Baku Animal is a variation on the very often copied Tetris type of game. The game has three different play modes: practice, normal and hard. It also can be played by two players against each other (except for the Master System version).

The objective is to pair animal heads with their respective food. If a rabbit head comes falling, you must make it fall on a pile of carrot tiles, dog heads with bones, panda heads with bamboos and monkey heads with bananas. There is a bonus item, the &amp;quot;BB coin&amp;quot;, which will appear from times to times, and remove piled tiles from the playfield. Removed tiles will be sent to the opponent's playfield all at once, increasing the difficulty of the task. Polly will face several contestants, and she'll win when her opponents get their playfield piled to the top.</resource>

The bank has 12 doors, and the bandits are behind each one of them. When they pull a gun out at you when you open a door, you have only a few seconds to shoot them before they shoot you. If you shoot them too early (ie: before he sticks his gun out at you), it is considered unfair, and you won't score any points, but if you're too late, he'll shoot you and you lose one of your three lives.If you waste too much time, a bandit will come out from one of the doors and stick dynamite on it. You must then shoot the dynamite to get rid of it. 

If you're lucky, either a man or a woman will throw you a bag of gold coins. If you shoot any of these people by accident, you also lose a life. More often than not, the person will throw his/her hands up, saying &amp;quot;I haven't got anything&amp;quot;. That's when they will be replaced by bandits. 

Some men will carry three to five pieces of gold on top of their heads, and shooting at all of the gold will award you with a bag of gold coins. Others will be tied up with rope. If you shoot the rope, there's more money for you, because not only will you receive one bag of gold coins, but you'll get three bags of gold coins.

There are more than ten rounds in Bank Panic, and each one ends when a person behind all 12 doors was able to throw you a bag of gold coins. The rounds get difficult the further you get. For example, in later rounds, a few bandits will block your shot, and you have to then shoot twice. Also, regardless of what round you're on, you can shoot so many bandits before time runs out.</resource>

But then the captain had a strange dream, nightmare in fact, where he was playing basketball against all these strange creatures in exotic locations.

Basketball Nightmare is a basketball game where the player plays basketball against strange humanoid creatures on the court where the creature lives. The player must play and defeat each creature before moving onto a new place with a new harder opponent. The player starts of playing against Wolfs in the Forest and then, upon defeating that opponent, moves on to play Frogs at the Pond, One Eyed Aliens at the Waterfall, Vampires in the Skeleton Cave, Geishas in the Bamboo Forest, before finally playing against Samurais at the Shrine.  If the player loses a match then that match can be replayed until won.

The player at the start of each match gets to pick how long the match duration is out of the options of 15, 30, or 45 minutes (not in real time) before being placed on the court. When on the court the player always plays towards the right of the court. First the player tries to get the ball from a throw by a well timed button press. When the player has the ball the player has the option to move, pass the ball, and jump. When jumping the player can shoot, with the accuracy of the shot depending on the timing, or just simply pass. When defending the player can cycle through the field or just simply run into the opponent to challenge for the ball. There are a few penalties that the player can get including but not limited to Travelling (not passing after jumping), Charging (Sometimes called when the player with the ball runs into an opponent), and Pushing (Sometimes called when the player without the ball runs into an opponent) with all the penalties resulting with the other team getting the ball on the side of the court.

Also there are two more modes called CPU vs CPU, where the player can get the CPU to play itself and Versus Play to play against a friend. In both modes the player or players pick one of the 8 nations that are USA, CBA, CHN, JPN, URS, DDR, CAN, and FRN all with a character representing a player of that nation. All the rules are the same as single player mode.</resource>

    <resource id="5e3626d0becdfa0f0bc5c9d6aa1ddbe5aa8a933d" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">From Sega 8-bit specialists Aspect comes one of many adaptations of Tim Burton's 1992 superhero sequel Batman Returns. Like other versions, it is a side-scrolling platformer. While very similar to the Game Gear version, the Master System version has slightly different levels and gameplay mechanics.

Batman must move through five stages on his way to defeat the Penguin. These include the streets and rooftops of Gotham City, Max Shreck's department store, the sewers, and the Penguin's lair. For the first four levels, a route can be selected from two options, allowing for different paths through the game.

Enemies standing in Batman's way can be defeated by throwing the Batarang at them. At the beginning, the weapon's range is very limited, but it can be expanded by collecting powerups. Other tools Batman can use are a grappling hook to pull himself up to higher levels or swing across dangerous areas, and his cape, which can be used as a parachute, for more control during falls.

Unlike in the Game Gear version, there is no health bar: a single hit will kill Batman. To compensate, the game contains a generous amount of extra lives.</resource>

You drive a red sports car and must apprehend eight target vehicles in selected cities across the USA, including Los Angeles, Chicago, Miami, and New York. You have to do this while avoiding yellow cars and other obstacles. Halfway through the eight stages, you enter a shop that allows you to upgrade your car and get some nitros, as long as you have money, and you will be rewarded if you apprehend the vehicles. This can be done by bumping into them to disable them.

All of a sudden a monster jumps out of the gameworld, captures both the Psicone CEO's daughter &amp; Zitz and takes them back into the Gamescape. Of course Rash and Pimple will have to enter the Gamescape and rescue them.

Battletoads in Battlemaniacs is another game in the Battletoads series by Rare. Much like its predecessor, it blends fighting game elements (in the style of Double Dragon) with other kinds of gameplay, like racing levels, &amp;quot;snake riding&amp;quot; levels and such. There are some bonus levels between some of the regular ones, where the player can collect extra lives.

Buddies can team up and defeat the opposition together in the two coop-modes available. In mode A, players can hit each other while in mode B, they can't.

Kyoko, your beautiful Japanese girlfriend, has been kidnapped, and in order to rescue her, you must get through a tireless army of enemies. These enemies come equipped with weapons that include whips, knives, swords, and flamethrowers, but Riki has to make do with his well-trained martial arts body.

Black Belt is a side-scrolling game that is split into seven chapters. During these chapters, you are fighting Chinese Kung Fu men, wrestlers, jujitsu men, eagles, ninjas, and black women. When you get halfway through the chapter, you will fight a different enemy than one that you encounter before. At the end of each chapter, you have to defeat several bosses before continuing on to the next round. Each type of these has their own personal strengths and weaknesses.

Once you touch an enemy or boss, you will lose energy. once you lose all energy, you lose a life, but more life can be restored by getting the cake when it comes across the screen in mid-air, or by defeating an enemy that will come at you halfway and you receive a bonus for doing so.

Black Belt is a modified version of the Japanese-exclusive Hokuto no Ken, with the licence removed and new level designs.</resource>

You just have to shoot your way on three planets (you have to travel through space first), blasting as many enemies as possible. Along the way, there are several bosses that you have to defeat. The later ones drop a power-up, which you can use to upgrade your ship. Some of the power-ups include double shots and laser beams. Another power-up gives you the ability to have an extra ship on your side and will join the fight, and will later serve as a backup. Blade Eagle is designed for play in conjunction with the Sega 3-D Glasses. If you play without the 3-D glasses, it will look like as if there are two of your ships, not just one. If there are four enemies approaching you, they will look like eight.</resource>

This figure asks them to collect certain items that he has placed inside various buildings to test his security force. If they return the items successfully, Mobo and Robo will be rewarded. The two of them state that they will get the job done in just three minutes. However, little do they know that each building is packed with security guards who will raise the alarm if they are caught red-handed. Fortunately both Mobo and Robo are equipped with bullets that can knock the guards unconscious for a few seconds. An $100 reward will be given out if Mobo and Robo are apprehended.

As either Mobo or Robo, you must collect all the treasures before leaving the ten buildings and shoot any security guards that get in your way. Remember that you are under a time limit. An in-game map will help you locate the treasures. There is a bonus stage after three buildings, where the object is to collect the gold bars in a limited amount of time without  one of the three spotlights shining on you. If it is possible, hide behind open doors. If you manage to get all the gold bars, 10,000 points is added to your score. There are three of these bonus stages, but each of them varies.</resource>

Now he needs to stop her, free his pal Lucky and find the Toon Toaster to un-wax the Toons.

In this platform game, the player controls Bonkers through several levels where he must find 7 pickle clues. By pressing the pause button, a compass is shown, with the number of remaining clues and the direction of the next one. Bonkers can run (by holding button 1), jump (button 2) , duck and slide (by running and pressing the opposite direction on the d-pad).

Bonkers will find several items to restore his health (like cups of coffee, donuts, slices of pizza and badges) as well as some bonus items. He'll also find some of his friends, like Marylin, who'll show him the way to bonus levels, where he must find pieces of the Toon Toaster. In these bonus levels, Bonkers will ride a mine cart in a rail course, trying to collect items.

After a row of sub-levels, Bonkers will have to fight a boss, usually villains from the TV show.

Players take the role of Jonathan Harker whose mission to to destroy Count Dracula by first heading to Transylvania and then London.

Jonathan Harker can move left and right, jump and attack with a weapon, the most basic of which is a knife. The status display on the screen shows Harker's health bar, countdown timer to complete the level and currently held weapon.  Throughout the levels question mark boxes (similar to the Mario games) can be found, attacking these will reveal power ups which include health restoration, timer increase and new weapons. Among these new weapons are axes, daggers and a shotgun. Question mark boxes can also be used as platforms to reach other areas and enemies. Each stage is divided into two sections: the &amp;quot;Daytime&amp;quot; and the &amp;quot;Nighttime&amp;quot;. These are entirely different levels comparable to stage 1-a and 1-b. Harker must jump to various platforms and obstacles and defeat minor enemies throughout the levels. The end of a Nighttime level is usually guarded by a boss creature who must be defeated to progress.</resource>

The only way to transform back is to reach the end of the cave...

Bubble Bobble is a platform game, with each level being a single screen. The enemies must be cleared from a level to go to the next one. With one player controlling Bub and the other controlling Bob, the player can jump and collect items for points (such as fruit). The real power Bub and Bob have however is the ability to blow bubbles. These bubbles can be as platforms to leap on, or to trap enemies. Enemies trapped in a bubble must be popped by jumping into them, wherein they'll turn to fruit. Additionally, power-ups sometimes float by in bubbles. They include lightning, which flies out horizontally at enemies, and water, which drags the player and enemies straight down flowing over platforms. Taking too long to complete any level will summon Baron Von Blubba, who will float around the screen trying to destroy the player.</resource>

You embark on a journey to find Captain Silver's secret treasure hoard, which is rumored to be hidden on an island in the Eastern Seas.

There are six scenes in the game. During his travels, Jim will explore villages, fight his way on board ships, venture through caves, and wander around tropical islands. In each of these six scenes, Jim must use his sword to kill cats, rats, bats, witches, skeletons, and other creatures that are waiting for him. When Jim touches, or is shot at, by a creature, he loses one of his lives, but when he kills a creature, he can collect some gold that they leave behind, which can be used to buy items from shops. However, rather than getting gold, enemies leave behind some gold containing one of the letters that spell the word &amp;quot;CAPTAIN SILVER&amp;quot;. If Jim manages to get all of these letters, he will be awarded an extra life.

Jim may only use his sword to start off with, but once he collects a fairy that floats toward him in every scene, Jim will be able to shoot stars at enemies, making his kills more efficient. The maximum number of stars that he can have is six. There are other power-ups that Jim can collect in the game. These include the &amp;quot;clock&amp;quot; power-up, which gives Jim extra time; the &amp;quot;boot&amp;quot; power-up which allows Jim to jump higher; and the &amp;quot;coffee?&amp;quot; power-up, which enables Jim to shield himself from creatures until he is hit by one.

There is a boss in each scene, which he must defeat in order to proceed to the next round. There is also a certain time limit, which Jim must complete the scene before it expires. If he does not, then he will lose a life.</resource>

Once inside, Zequinha went to the kitchen and saw a jug with some kind of juice inside it. Not thinking twice, he drank it, only to discover it was one of Dr. Vitor potions, which turned him into a baby once again! Now Pedro and Biba must find 4 ingredients to make an antidote to the potion.

Castelo Rá-Tim-Bum (Ra-Tim-Bum Castle) is an action/adventure game based on a quite popular educative Brazilian TV series, produced during the mid 90's but aired as late as 2007. The player can chose to play either Pedro or Biba to search for the ingredients through five levels. The main difference between the two is that Biba is a little faster than Pedro.

Each level involves some platforming and minor puzzle solving elements, like jumping over the right sequence of platforms, or finding food inside the kitchen's drawers in the right order. To enter each level, the player must choose the right door, based on the doorkeeper's tips.

The player has three lives and a health bar, and continues are available. All the text in game is in Portuguese.</resource>

Story and themes remain the same, but the game has unique levels and slightly different gameplay mechanics.

To save his girlfriend Minnie from the evil witch Mizrabel, Mickey Mouse must venture into the Castle of Illusion. Crossing six levels (including a magical forest, a toy land and a candy world), he must collect the gems of the rainbow in order to confront and defeat the witch.

Each level features unique obstacles, enemies and a final boss. The enemies can be defeated by jumping on top of them. An alternative way is to pick up objects lying around (like rocks in the forest or blue balls in the toy level) and throwing them at the enemies. Mickey's ability to pick up things and carry them around also leads to puzzle-oriented gameplay. By placing objects in the right spot and jumping off of them, he can get to areas otherwise out of reach. In some levels, he also has to collect keys to open doors. A unique type of object is the treasure chest - by jumping on top of one or throwing it, Mickey gets access to its contents, which might include extra lives, a health power-up or coins to collect for points.</resource>

Chapolim X Drácula: Um Duelo Assustador (which translates Chapolim vs. Dracula: A Frightening Duel) is an authorized &amp;quot;hack&amp;quot; of Ghost House, with Ghost House's hero, Mick, replaced by Chapolim (or El Chapulín Colorado in original Spanish), a famous Mexican character from a TV series. Chapolim is a parody to superheroes in general. He dresses a red grasshopper costume with a yellow heart in the chest with the leters &amp;quot;CH&amp;quot;. He also usually carries his Marreta Biônica (Chipote Chillón in the original, Squeaky Mallet in English) a red (toy) hammer.

At each stage, Chapolim must defeat five vampires that are in torpor within their coffins. The coffins are locked, so he must first find the keys to unlock them. He'll find the keys killing the most diverse enemies that haunt the mansion he's in, such as ghosts, bats, fire blowers, mummies, etc. Once he's got a key, he must unlock a coffin and then defeat the vampire who sleeps there.

In order to kill his enemies, Chapolim can jump over them or punch them. Every once in a while, his Marreta Biônica will come flying from one side of the screen to another, and if he jumps over it, he'll catch it. Chapolim can also punch the lights of the mansion: they'll flash and paralyze his enemies.

Chapolim starts with 3 lives and no continues. He'll be healed by collecting treasures through the castle, and will gain additional lives at every 50,000 and 150,000 points.

As you may remember, Chuck Rock had to rescue his girl, Ophelia from the bad dude Gary Gritter.  Well, he was successful in his efforts, and now Chuck and Ophelia are married.  Eventually, they have a son, named Junior. Chuck works in a factory, where he develops great skill at carving automobiles out of stone. A rival manufacturer becomes jealous of Chuck's abilities and kidnaps him.  Now it is up to Junior to rescue his dad!

The gameplay in this sequel is similar to the first game, but with some minor differences since you are playing as Junior, rather than Chuck. This is a side-scrolling platform game with occasional rock-moving puzzles thrown in. Unlike Chuck, Junior carries a club that gives his attacks further reach.

However, in columns they are groups of 3 same-size but varying color blocks, which must be arranged into sequences of 3 or more, either horizontally, vertically or diagonally. Sequences of 4 or 5 count for double or triple points, and diagonal sequences score the most. The real trick is to set up 'combos' - where one line causes other blocks to drop so as to create other lines.

As well as the normal game mode, there is also a 'flash' mode, in which the aim is simply to remove a particular block from the base of the pre-formed pile of bricks. The difficulty of this can be determined by increasing the number of complete rows which are already in place.</resource>

Cool Spot could also cling to and climb various things by jumping up in front of them. In each level the player must rescue other cool spots, who look exactly alike, from cages at the end of that level, which is not necessarily the point at the far right of the level map. In order to do so, the player is required to collect a certain number of &amp;quot;spots&amp;quot; that would change (usually increase) as the game progressed. &amp;quot;Spots&amp;quot; were placed across the level in large quantities.</resource>

Trouble is, no one believes his tale of the planet he discovered! Your job is to help Linus make his way back to planet Earth so he can take some pictures to convince his friends. Gameplay consists of two parts, an adventure and arcade action. In adventure mode you can explore lands, find objects, and talk to people. Sentences can be constructed by using the pointer to select actions or objects on the screen (This is similar to the interface LucasArts used in games such as Maniac Mansion.) To reach many new locations involves the action mode, where you will need to cross treacherous landscapes and evade dangerous creatures. This portion resembles a side scrolling platform game. Once you've cleared an action sequence, you will not need to do so again if you decide to revisit a location. Whenever you wish you can receive a password allowing you to continue the game later from the same point.</resource>

Time has passed and it is the year 2XXX where atomic power plants in countries around the world are attacked, and plutonium, which was the equivalent of 100,000 megatons of explosive power, was stolen from these plants. The words &amp;quot;Cyber Zeed&amp;quot; was always written at the scene of the crime. Later, the world realized what Cyber Zeed had planned to do: use their nuclear capabilities to terrorize the world. Every nation sent their best forces to stop this threat, but all of them failed. 

Joe Musashi came forward to this great evil, and he is required to fight those who rose from the ashes and put an end to this threat.

Cyber Shinobi is a one-player game that consists of six rounds. You need to fight ninjas that get in your way using your fists and legs. You can also defeat them using special attacks and ninjitsu. Power-ups can be collected along the way, which will give you more shots, ninjitsu, power, and life. A boss needs to be defeated at the end of the round.

Cyborgs are about to take complete control of the universe under the direction of Vipron, their evil leader. You are sent to the cyborg fortress to get rid of all the chief cyborgs in each of the seven areas. 

The game screen is divided into three sections. This includes a first-person view of the map, in which you can see objects that are coming your way. There are two types of objects: red objects indicate the lower cyborgs, while white ones indicate the chief cyborgs. Next to it is a map of the area, your life and psycho power count. Below these is the action screen. 

In each of these seven areas, there are several floors which can be reached via the elevator. At the beginning of the game, your only weapons are your fists, but weapons can be collected throughout each area, which include psycho punch, ray gun, light gun, and bombs. Power-ups like extra life and psycho power can also be collected. If you use the psycho punch or psycho gun, your psycho power gets depleted, and when it is empty, you must stock up on some more. You can also get shields that will protect you from laser beams, and jet engines so that you can fly over hazards.
In some areas, you defeat a boss which leaves an ID card, which you can use to access other areas of the fortress. 

Some chief cyborgs are easy to kill, while some are hard. You will just have to work out which weapon works best with them. The game ends when you lose all your life. 

You are not alone in this mission. You also have Adina, your contact back at headquarters. Follow her instructions carefully and you may survive.

Cyborg Hunter is based on the Japanese-only Borgman.</resource>

    <resource id="83c0f23d9c6ce3c3dae3b3333e8127ddccfeb471" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Long ago, in the distant land of Moralos, in a time when vast jungles still covered the Earth, an evil presence emerged from its tomb beneath the ground. His name was Gilbas, and he was about to destroy the inhabitants of the land. Aganan, a great warrior, was summoned to save the troubled land and put an end to Gilbas by sealing him in the tome from where it came.

Unfortunately, Gilba was successfully resurrected and another warrior, Danan, was called. His quest is to locate the three sacred objects that Aganan used to defeat Gilbas: &amp;quot;The Orb of Light&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;The Amulet of Light&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;The Knife of Light&amp;quot;. 

There are about four rounds to complete, and has Danan going through exotic locations defeating enemies such as valkyries, ogres, bees, spiders, and several others. At the end of each round, you come face to face with a boss, which takes quite a number of hits to kill with your sword. Once they are defeated, they are likely to give you one of the objects that you need to defeat Gilbas. More to the story is then revealed.

Assisting you with your journey are three animals: an eagle, a monkey, and some other animal that I am unfamiliar with. To get these animals to help you, however, you will need to collect three of their tokens that are found in yellow chests. These animals are quite useful in dangerous situations. The eagle, for example, can get a hold of you and fly you to safety if more than one type of enemy surrounds you. Anyway, you can get these animals to help you at any place, at any time, as long as you have three of its tokens. Yellow chests can also reveal extra strength, extra time, or extra health.

The game ends when you run out of time, or when you lose your health, and there are no second chances, unless you manage to find some elixirs, which are rare.</resource>

But Uncle Scrooge has been cursed by a pendant he found while adventuring, and is now floating in the air like a balloon!  He gives Donald his adventurer's diary and asks Donald to retrace his steps and return the pendant to its rightful place - this is the only thing that will return Scrooge to normal.

Deep Duck Trouble is a platform game where you play as Donald Duck.  You must make your way through four different areas of the island - the jungle, an inlet, a volcano, and a valley - and defeat bosses at the end of each area.  Donald can defeat enemies by jumping on their heads.  He can also defeat them by kicking bricks which will may then hit his enemies.  Donald's trademark temper also comes into play: if he eats a chili pepper, he will become furious and plough through anything in his way, whether it be bricks or enemies!</resource>

You are Dick Tracy, a police detective who enjoys a peaceful life with his wife. But his wife's father is murdered by a local gangster named Big Boy Caprice, and Dick Tracy is now out for revenge. The game doesn't follow the exact plot of the movie, but simply lets Dick Tracy fight his way through several levels until he faces his archenemy.

This is a platform shooter/&amp;quot;beat-'em-up&amp;quot; game. Plenty of gunmen will attack our hero from all the sides. Dick can only move to the right or to the left. He can use his pistol gun to take out enemies who are in front or behind him. Since he can't approach enemies who attack from the depth of the screen, he can dispose of them using his machine gun. When the enemy is too close, Dick will punch him instead of shooting.</resource>

Your journey will take you through jungles, wastelands, villages, seashore, and finally, to the mountain.

It was developed in South Korea by a company known as &amp;quot;Sis Co.&amp;quot; in 1991, without the backing from either Sega or Nintendo. The game uses a completely different set of graphics and music to Dr. Mario, but the gameplay is exactly the same.

Despite being released on a Master System cartridge, the Master System version runs in SG-1000 mode, and hence appears to have weaker graphics than most other Master System games. This is likely because the MSX and SG-1000 share similar specifications, and porting from one system to another was not too difficult.</resource>

    <resource id="e91bf99d4d5458f8fa4f8acac66a7ec68b7ee17c" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Dragon Crystal is a dungeon crawler with RPG elements, along the lines of classics such as Rogue or Nethack. Without relying on a story, the game throws you into a randomly generated world which you should explore carefully - and most importantly, where you must survive! The complex, maze-like levels reveal their structure only after you cover the corresponding map areas. Your goal in each level is to reach a teleporter which will take you to the next one. There are also a lot of random items scattered around - weapons, armor, money, and food. Money allows you to continue the game if you die, food prevents you from starving. The enemies are visible on screen, and you fight them in a fast-paced turn-based combat, moving around and pressing direction arrows to strike with the equipped weapon. You are always accompanied by an egg which will eventually grow up to be a dragon if you have leveled up enough.</resource>

Being able to use direct-combat moves as well as collecting bonus weapons, and food for energy recharging, is pretty typical as well. Games of this type that were converted from the arcade to home computers are particularly commonplace - Renegade and the Double Dragon series are famous examples.

Where this one stands out, however, is the setting of your character as a duck called Bin, and with motion having a clear waddling appearance. The enemies to fight are all from the animal kingdom, but somewhat warped - crocodiles with boxing moves and cows armed with rocket packs for example. Bin has six levels to clear before he can rescue Lucy from Archaca's clutches.

You control a little character whose main attack comes from his disembodied head. Yes, years before Rayman appeared, we already had a hero who used detachable appendages to attack his enemies.

Rather than the traditional power-ups, Dynamite Headdy enables you to swap your head for different kinds – such as heads that heal you or heads that stick on to walls. You use your head in order to climb up on platforms as well, as you can grab hold of things with it, and on certain stages of the Mega Drive/Genesis version it is used to turn the game into a side-scrolling shooter, as you gain a propeller, jet, or bird head. Basically, Dynamite Headdy is just a traditional platformer at heart.</resource>

Police officers who are promoted to this unit wear a cyber-suit that contains state-of-the-art military equipment including two Turbo-Booster Thrusters, extra ammunition, and increased protection. In order to become an ESWAT member, all a dedicated police officer has to do is arrest enough criminal masterminds to progress through the ranks, which include Captain, Assistant Chief, and Chief.

ESWAT: Cyber Police is a horizontal-scrolling beat 'em up where you have to make your way from left to right and defeat a mastermind. There are 15 stages to complete, and have you patrolling through Liberty streets, car yards, stadiums, restaurants, the CBD, construction sites, and boat docks. While you're out on patrol, you can pick up ammunition, and the amount you get varies. For example, on some levels, ammo may be worth 10 bullets, while in others, you may get 60 bullets. Once you have obtained the cyber-suit, you wear it for the duration of the game.

Ecco: The Tides of Time features even better graphics than its predecessor, and introduces a new gameplay mode in which the camera follows the dolphin from behind instead of from the side.

The gameplay involves you racing against the clock to get to the finish line and jumping over ramps. At the end of each race you get points for how many cars or bikes you have overtaken with which you can upgrade your bike.
There are various different terrain for you to race on including desert beach and dirt tracks plus a number of things to slow you down or even knock you off of your bike all together. The main idea is to find the best route through each level to shave off valuable seconds in order to over take more cars and bikes.

The Japanese version of the game has more Tracks than the European and US versions have. Among  them is a snow track which is one of the hardest tracks in the game, because there is a lot of stones on the thin road.</resource>

There are two modes of play available: &amp;quot;Arcade&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Grand Prix&amp;quot;. In both of these modes you complete a certain number of laps (4, 8, or 12) and select which circuit that you want to race on. The circuits include San Marino, France, Britain, Germany, Italy, Portugal, Japan, and Australia. Some circuits are easy, while some are difficult. 

There are slight differences between the two modes. For instance, &amp;quot;Arcade&amp;quot; allows you to select the circuit in any order that you like, whereas &amp;quot;Grand Prix&amp;quot; only allows you to fine-tune your car before starting a race. You also need to race a circuit in the order that they appear on the circuit selection screen, but you can skip a track if you want. 

F1 is a 1-2 player game, meaning that if you have another player handy, you can compete against each other.</resource>

The televisual presentation, one of the unique points of the early EA Sports titles, with hosts introducing the matches, was another thing making the game stand out from a market dominated by Sensible Soccer and Kick Off games.

Based on international teams (with fictional player names), their abilities in each skill area rated out of 10 to give the player an overall impression of how good they are. The options available follow the standard set: fouls and offsides can be toggled on and off, the match length can be set, and if the timer operates  continuously, or only while the ball is in play. Gameplay privileges quick runs, short passes and blistering shots outside the penalty box, and set pieces are controlled by moving a box into the target area for the ball, and then passed, lobbed or kicked directly. On the tactical side, formations can be selected, with 5 different strategies also available (although not all of these combinations make sense) as can the team Coverage - the areas which defenders, midfielders and strikers cover.</resource>

The most technically-advanced of Dizzy's adventure games in many ways, it was the only one to feature actual scrolling rather than a flick-screen system, the only one not to be released for the 8 bit computers the character originated on, the only one to originate on a console, as well as featuring many mini-games, such as Bubble Dizzy and an Operation Wolf clone. 

Gameplay involves walking Dizzy through the levels, picking up objects and using them to solve simple puzzles. There are plenty of tests of arcade skill along the way as well, as gaps must be jumped and baddies avoided - starting with a limited number of lives, the player can earn more by completing Theodore's puzzle. Before rescuing Daisy the player must capture all stars that unlock the gates of the tower.

    <resource id="edfb6ffd7260b5684ec2c2ee1d39f79a825c661d" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Sega decided to make their last game in the Fantasy Zone series different. You see, the gameplay now involves you going around mazes, collecting all the dots while avoiding enemies. You are awarded points for each dot collected, but they vary depending on their size. For example, small dots award ten points each, while you get 200 points for each larger dot you collect. Once you have collected all the dots in the maze, the enemies will turn into coins, which you must quickly get in a strict time limit and you move on to the next maze. Just before this, though, you get a statistics screen that shows the amount of time that you spent in the maze. Points are also awarded, but sadly, if you spent over sixty seconds in a maze, you won't get any.

Every world you travel to consist of three mazes, and after you complete all three, a bonus round appears where the object is to collect all coins before time expires. While you are collecting the dots in the normal mazes, you must touch the enemy's energy, a flashing red spot within each maze to avoid 2nd-generation enemies from entering the mazes. Some power-ups can be collected, which consist of weapons and speed boosters (big wings), which can be collected by landing on the circle which it is in. However, you need money in form of the amount outlined just before each maze. If you land on a circle while you are short of cash, a 'NO SELLING' sign will appear above it, and you have to collect some more dots and try again. 

Also you can die by touching an enemy. When you die, a coin will take you place, and when you get resurrected, you can grab the coin. The game can be played with two players, but the same rule applies in a 2-player game.

You must destroy the large creatures in each world before moving on to the next. Your task becomes difficult by other small creatures that happen to pass by. If you destroy a large creature, they will drop a dollar bill, which you can pick up and use at the shop to buy items and powerful weapons such as laser beams, x-way shots, and big wings. Another way to get money is to shoot certain kinds of enemies all in a row.

More often than not, some large creatures will reveal a warp gate rather than a dollar bill. You can go through the warp gate to get to another part of the land, and destroy more large creatures. Only one of them will have a warp gate in the form of a 'stop' sign - that is your ticket to the round boss, but you must defeat all large creatures in order to pass through it. Also like in the original can you walk on the ground to avoid approaching enemies, and spend money in the shop to get new weapons (but they only last for a limited time).</resource>

In the levels you must jump on platforms and kill your enemies. The enemies (for example, birds and penguins) can be shot with your ice cubes; they become frozen, so you smash them. Sometimes they leave part of a key behind after they're destroyed.  The complete key, assembled from all the pieces, opens the door to the next world. 

In this &amp;quot;jump &amp; run&amp;quot; you can also get some power-ups. You can find some coyote puppies; these puppies follow you, are invulnerable, and also shoot enemies. In higher regions you find some snow-flakes; enough of these and you get a great snowball for freezing more enemies on the screen.</resource>

Apart from a speedy protagonist, the game has some similarities to Sonic the Hedgehog, as the levels have a similarly complex structure with different passages and many optional areas.</resource>

It's weekend! Fred Flintstone thinks of only one thing: bowling  
with his friend and neighbor Barney.
Unfortunately, his wife Wilma got other plans for him. Fred has to paint the living room and Wilma is not going to help him with it. No, she goes shopping.
And if that's not enough, Wilma also tells Fred that his mother-in-law is coming over.

The Flintstones game is divided in four parts.

Part 1: Painting the walls of your living room.
To go to the bowling alley before it is closed Fred has to paint  the walls as quickly as possible. To paint the walls Fred uses the tail of a living squirrel. 
Pebbles tries to leap out her playpen and starts crawling around and starts scribbling on the walls. If Fred wants to put Pebbles back in the playpen then he has to drop the squirrel, that immediately starts wandering off. When Pebbles is back in the playpen Fred has to chase the squirrel and dip its tail in the paint again.

Part 2: Driving your car on the way to the bowling center.
Finally, when all walls are painted Fred can go to the bowling  
alley!
Fred has to drive to the bowling alley but unfortunately the roads are in a very bad condition. The road surface is dire and covered with rocks!
And if one of the wheels hit a bump it will break off the car and disappear into the distance.

Part 3: A bowling competition between Fred and Barney.
At the bowling alley the following bowling parameters can be set: the spin and speed of the ball and the starting position of the player.
Each turn gives two throws (except he gets a strike). A game  
takes ten turns. while a match takes three games.

Part 4: Saving Pebbles at a construction site.
On his way home Fred discovers that Pebbles has disappeared!  Don't let Wilma find that out!
Fred finds Pebbles at a construction site on top of some  
scaffolding. He has to climb the scaffolding to rescue her.
If Fred fails to rescue his daughter then Barney rescues her and Fred will be branded as a failure!</resource>

Once you have done that, you must get through one of the open doorways. To navigate the room, you can walk either on the gray tiles, or the yellow ones that surround them. Monsters also can walk on these gray tiles, but you can make them fall down if you smash a tile that they're on. The monsters will regenerate in the room after five seconds.

Be careful of dragons that will throw fireballs at you. If you get hit by a dragon, its fireball, or one of the monsters, you will lose a life.
You can collect keys that will open locked doorways, so that you can exit through them. Some power-ups can also be collected. Collecting hearts, for example, will freeze all monsters on screen for a limited amount of time, giving you the opportunity of killing them.</resource>

It confiscates a horde of planes and warships, and as a UN loyalist, it is your job to shoot them down. Solving starvation and disease can wait, apparently.

The game is split into 8 stages, which are split into sub-stages over land and sea, each of which has a strict time limit, and a target number of planes to shoot down. They take place from behind your plane, which can be controlled with ‘up’ referring to ‘climb’ or ‘dive’, depending on player preference. You are armed with 10 missiles as well as standard weapons. The plane can survive a few hits, so watch the damage report as it goes from red to black. 

Fail to complete a section in the time limit and you use up a continue, but the amount of planes previously shot down is not reset, making the second attempt easier Chase HQ style. As you destroy enemies you gain access to better planes, and the rank reported at the end of the game improves – this is also dependent on the skill level you play at.</resource>

    <resource id="1166be9eadfa6b20016018a221c3a85da8bae380" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">GP Rider is an arcade like motorcycle racing game that players can race in all the tracks of all the 15 tracks of the 1989 Motorcycle Grand Prix. There is also an extra Arcade track for the player to race on.

There are 3 modes of play that are Arcade, Tournament, and Grand Prix. In Arcade the player races on only 1 track that is named Arcade. In Tournament players get to choose any number of tracks to race, from 0 (which defaults to the Arcade track) to all 15 available tracks. Grand Prix is where the player races in all 15 tracks in order of the 1989 season. 

All races regardless of the mode played in the same way. The game is played on a split screen even if only one player is playing. A CPU character named Wayne controls the bike on the top screen if there is no other player playing. Wayne races like a real player would, having both good and bad races and occasionally making mistakes. The race is made up of a Qualify to determine gird position and then the Race where the player races 15 other races (including Wayne) over a predefined number of laps depending on track length. The track can raced in ether the wet or the dry (only dry in Arcade mode) and the weather can change from the Qualify to the Race. The races take place on flat roads with straights and curves simulating the layout of the real track. On the bike there is a fuel gage that simply counts down the seconds left of fuel and is automatically refilled at the completion of each lap. If the player doesn’t complete the lap before time runs out then the player will “Out of Fuel” and end the race in the placed down with other non-finishers. At the end of each race (accept in Arcade mode) the player will get points depending on there position before going onto the next race.

The player sets up the bike with some basic set ups that are all available from the start. In Arcade mode the player has the options of an Automatic or Manual gearbox with either High Gearing (better top speed) or Low Gearing (better acceleration). In Tournament and Grand Prix modes the options are extended to Engine type of Lean, Medium, and Thirsty which progressively adds speed while cutting the time available per lap. There is gearing that works the same as Arcade mode, and a tyre type of wet and dry depending on the weather.</resource>

All it really shares with the cartoon are the main characters, and even they don't look quite the same.

The game resembles Alex Kidd in Miracle World quite a bit. Kkachi has to retrieve six keys from six stages that are selectable from the beginning. Enemies are either beaten by slapping them or by using limited special moves. There are random items (garlic, fruit, etc.) lying or floating around throughout the levels that amount to money, which can be used in stores to buy items. After each (mostly uninspired) bossfight, Kkachi gets also a special weapon only usable against bosses. Unfortunately the mechanic is broken and only the first weapon ever gained can be used, and even that only once throughout the entire game.</resource>

The goal is get all of the soldiers to the opposite side of the screen or to kill all of the enemies. Each soldier in the army has a unique specialization, from among 20 types. Each soldier can attack in two different ways, using either a normal weapon or a special weapon. The strategy comes from deciding which soldier would do best in which situation. Some weapons are better at dealing with certain enemies and obstacles than other weapons.

Players start with only three soldiers but can encounter other soldiers that can be rescued, by touching them. If the new solider survives long enough to reach the exit, they can be added to the soldier inventory. The number of possible soldier in a player's army is over 30 soldiers. There are 50 stages total, divided into rounds of 10. At the end of each round, players encounter an enemy boss.</resource>

If you fail to shoot at them quickly, the debris will eventually come in contact with it. If this happens, 10% of the planet's life will be lost. Once you have destroyed enough debris, you receive a bonus for how much planet life that remains and move on to the next round. Later in the game, you will receive a 3-way shot as well as protection that will greatly help you in further rounds. The game ends when you lose all your lives or the planet blows up. 25 rounds.</resource>

The game is divided into four &amp;quot;scenes&amp;quot;, or planets: the A world is a green planet, world B is a fire-ridden lava planet, world C is a green water planet and world D is barren ice planet. You must fly your spaceship above the planet's surface, facing not only Space Harrier-style enemy attack waves, but also natural phenomena such as meteorites, lava eruptions and tornadoes. To fight them, you have a vulcan as well as an undepletable stock of missiles.

Once you have fought your way across the planet, you enter a tunnel system in the inner confines of the planet. As the tunnel turns, you are given directions as to which way you must manoeuvre, but the narrow tunnel gives you little space to take evasive action. Once you escape the tunnel, the entire planet is destroyed, leading you towards the ultimate boss encounter.</resource>

Four of its six events were removed and now the player can only compete in the Surfing and BMX events. The team selection (sponsorship) was also removed, as well as the ability of naming your players. Each player will get a default name (PLAY1, for instance), and the game will select teams in order (player 1 gets Maxx-Out, player 2 gets Costa del Mar, and so on). The trophy screens were also removed, so the player don't see the team logo on it. He only knows in which team he is during the event competition, when his name and team appears on the top of the screen.

Up to eight players can take turns competing in either one of the two events, or both. They can also choose to practice in one single event. 

In the Surfing event, the player must perform maneuvers on the wave as trying to keep as much time as he can inside the tube, or jumping off and on the wave. He can speed up his board by climbing and descending the wave, and can slow it down by holding button 2 while maneuvering. When his time runs out, the judges will tell him his score.

In the BMX event, the player must perform jumps and maneuvers while trying to complete the course. He can speed up his bike by pressing button 1 repeatedly and jump by pressing button two. While in the middle of a jump, pressing different directions on the d-pad will make the biker perform different kinds of jumps. The more dangerous the maneuver, the more points he gets. If he crashes three times, he's eliminated.</resource>

One or two players must make their way through 100 levels of mayhem and magic. 

It featured a choice of four characters to play with, each with different weapons. Thor the Warrior, has a  bludgeoning battle axe, Thyra the Valkyrie, has a close range sword, Questor the Elf has his long range bow, and Merlin the Wizard has magical bolts.

Ghosts, goblins and even the life draining Death are your enemies. Enemies stream out of generators, so destroy these before tackling the rest. 

Keys are needed to open the many doors within the levels, and in some situations a door will contain only bonus items, not a progressive route.  Scattered magic potions act like smart bombs and clear the screen of all enemies. Beware of poison though, this reduces your energy level.
Treasure is abundant throughout the levels and adds to your score.</resource>

The game is a reworking of the Master System title James 'Buster' Douglas Knockout Boxing, not to be confused with the Genesis title with the same name, which is entirely different.

Just like the other versions players are cast as George Foreman to go through a series of boxing matches against different opponents to win the championship title belt. Compared to the other titles, these versions have new opponents and show the boxers from the side. Players can move left or right in the ring to avoid punches. Other moves including blocking, and left and right punches that can be varied into jabs and crosses. Matches can last up to ten rounds and when no regular or technical knock-out occurs, the winner is based on the jury's points, provided between the rounds. During knock-out phases, no buttons need to be pressed to get the boxer back to his feet. At the start of the game, a slow or fast speed for the gameplay can be selected.

Each match the player's boxer can use three super punches. These need to be charged and then unleashed when near an opponent. It sends them straight to the back of the ring, a dangerous area as it is easy to keep punching them into the ropes. Health is slightly restored during the intermission and after each won match the player is awarded skill points to be distributed over three characteristics. Matches for two players are supported.</resource>

Geraldinho is a modified version of Teddy Boy, with Teddy Boy replaced by Geraldinho, a famous Brazilian comic character. Geraldinho is an infantile version of another comic character, Geraldão (both drawn by the Brazilian cartoonist Glauco). He is a boy addicted to soft drinks, ice cream and TV, and he's always with his friends, the dog Cachorrão and the cat Tufinho.

In this platform game, Geraldinho must defeat enemies using his ray gun. The enemies will come out of dice-faced boxes, and there will be as much enemies as shown at the box face. Once they are shot, they are turned into little balls, which must be quickly collected. If they're are not collected in a short period of time, they will turn into little creatures which will steal away time. Once all enemies are defeated, Geraldinho will proceed to the next level.

If Geraldinho stands for too long on a platform, it will disintegrate, causing him to fall to the platform below. Sometimes this is the only way to get out of some closed places.

From time to time Geraldinho will also play a bonus game, in which he must shoot boxes to get objects inside them. He must also avoid boxes with those little stealing time creatures.</resource>

They're hidden inside the haunted mansion, which wouldn't be such a big deal if it weren't infested with Draculas, Bats, Fire Blowers, Mummies, and other deadly weirdos. You'll have to ward off or destroy everything that gets in your way -- no matter how grotesque it appears. Furthermore, you'll have to keep punching your way through the mansion until you find the secret key. You then have to use it to open one of the five coffins, defeat Dracula, capture the jewel he drops, and make your way out of the mansion.

You play the role of Mick, and everything is going to stop you from completing these tasks and making you way out of the mansion. You just have to punch, or jump on, your enemies to defeat them. And arrows will be flying from either direction and will attempt to hit you on the head, and you must either duck or jump on them for extra points. You can jump or touch lights to freeze everything on screen for a few seconds. Rather than punching, you can collect a sword on the lower level by jumping on it as it flies past you. The sword is useful when you fight Dracula or getting rid of Fire Blowers.

You start the game with three lives, and receive an additional life every 50,000 and 150,000 points. You also have an energy meter. You lose energy when you touch one of the monsters. When you run out of energy, you lose a life. You gain energy by collecting treasures scattered throughout the mansion, and it is restored when you kill a Dracula.</resource>

However New York City has suddenly become a very haunted place, and the number of ghosts has suddenly increased. The Ghostbusters must reduce the paranormal (PK) level in the city, representing ghost power, before the Temple of Zuul awakens and ressurect an evil goddess, Gozer.

Ghostbusters is an action game that combines an overhead view and a side-view. From Ghostbusters HQ, the player must monitor the map of New York City for &amp;quot;ghost alarms&amp;quot; as well as casual spirits, and plot a route to the alarmed area. The player then controls the Ghostbuster vehicle as it drives through traffic. Here, the player is able to capture casual ghosts on the way if they are en route. Once at the location, the game switches to a side-view. Two of the ghostbusters will take position and activate their proton beams and toss a trap to the ground. The player will attempt to  maneuver the ghost(s) over the placed trap. Once activated, the trap attempts to capture any ghosts directly above it. Successful capture will earn the player money, which can then be used to purchase new Ghostbusters vehicles and new modifications for the vehicle. Unsuccessful capture will see the ghost fly away.

As the game progresses, the PK energy of the city increases. Ghostbusters must keep it under critical levels by being constantly  successful at ghost captures. Eventually the Temple of Zuul will activate, and if the PK levels are still manageable, the Ghostbusters can venture there for a final showdown with Gozer.</resource>

    <resource id="feb204c39c9228e3bd84570e65f1c902db2b6e97" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Three years have passed since Arthur defeated the Demon King Astaroth and rescued his beloved Princess Prin-Prin (see Ghosts 'N Goblins). A new villain, the Great Demon King Lucifer (Loki in some versions) has become the new leader of Ghoul Realm. While returning from a journey, Arthur sees the Princess' castle and her village under attack by Lucifer's forces. While rushing towards her beloved knight, the Princess is struck by one of Lucifer's laser beams.

Now, Arthur must venture back to the Lucifer's palace and destroy the demon in order to rescue the Princess' soul and bring her back to life! And it won't matter whether he fights in his shining armor or in his underwear alone...the bravest Knight in the land isn't going to be stopped by some monsters! Although the game starts with graveyard and marsh territory familiar from the first game, later levels are set in a tower, a mass of skeletons, and a castle.

Players progress from left to right (from bottom to top in level 3), and have to hack down the aforementioned monsters with a sword. The journey includes ledges, ladders, lava pits and slippery slopes. Different weapons can be collected, by finding suits of armor inside chests. Each of the five stages has its own setting and a final boss.

Your job: To destroy alien attackers who are waging a nuclear war against planets in the solar system, including Earth and even the moon!  What's unique about this title, is the satellite and your primary weapon move independently of each other.  Position your satellite too far away from the action and the bullets take too long to hit your target.  It's a good balance between dodging objects crucial to your survival and shooting down the enemy targets.  If the planet takes too much damage, you lose.  There are both Offensive and Defensive battle modes.  There is also a 2-player mode where you and a friend can team up, one controlling the satellite and the other controlling the weapon making this a multiplayer game as well.</resource>

In ancient times a horde of giants rebelled against the elders and a brutal war ensued. Things looked grave until finally a hero, carrying the Golden Axe, appeared and drove back the giants. Since then, the kingdom of Firewood has been ruled by a family that had mastered the power of the nine crystals to ward off all evil from Firewood. Everyone lived in peace until one of Firewood's ministers betrayed his king and sold the nine crystals to Death Adder, one of the evil giants. Death Adder has hidden the nine crystals in nine dungeons, has unleashed hordes of monsters and is threatening to take over the world. Will there be another hero who can find the Golden Axe and defeat Death Adder?

Gameplay in Golden Axe Warrior is very similar to The Legend Of Zelda, meaning you will spend most of your time exploring the large overworld fighting against lots of enemies and looking for the dungeons in which the crystals are hidden. Inside the dungeons you have to fight more enemies, find treasures and keys, solve simple puzzles and defeat the dungeon's boss to get one of the crystals. In order to survive against the large number of enemies, you will be able to find many different weapons and three different spells.</resource>

    <resource id="c25e4d4ecced9b813cef3e3efe73c93be4d69170" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Golfamania is a golfing simulation game where players play on an 18 hole golf course with all the rules and scoring like in the real game.

Within the game there are 4 different modes to play on that includes Practice, Match Play, Stroke Play, and Pro Tournament. In Practice a single player can play any of the 18 holes available. Match Play is 2 player mode against human or computer. Stroke Play is the player can play up to 4 others that can include 1 computer player. In this mode the character skill can increase in 3 different areas that are power, accuracy, and luck with the 6 different characters available. The main mode is the Pro Tournament and it is where the player plays against over 30 computer players (all playing different holes) with the objective to score lower than the other players (as per the rules of golf). Based on performance the player can earn experience points (XP) that they can use to upgrade the power, accuracy, and luck of the character for future tournaments. Some of the holes have awards like ‘longest drive’ and ‘hole in one’ awards that can earn bonus XP.     

Regardless of the mode the game is played in the same sort of way. The player selects a character (the selection depends on the mode) and then sets up the character by naming and picking their style.  In all modes but Practice the player must pick 3 golf clubs that they must remove from their selection of 17 different clubs (1-5 wood, 1-9 Iron, Pitching Wedge, Sand Wedge, and Putter). When playing the player is presented with a top down view where the player lines up the shot and the location on the golf ball they want to hit (for spin). Then the player selects the club they want to use (all go varying distances). When that is all done the player must play the skill part of the game, where they are presented with a power bar that has a marker that going is up and down along it. The player must stop the marker on the red area in the centre of the power bar to get a good hit (with the center been a perfect hit)and if this area is missed the ball will only travel about 20 yards (compared to about 100+ yards of a good hit). The amount of red that is on the power bar depends on the golf club used. To help the player the distance of the shot can be lowered in exchange for a lower marker speed and can be used for shots closer to the hole (very helpful for putter shots). The game uses battery backed RAM save to continue play later.</resource>

But in order to find him, you must defeat seven of his fiercest demons that were sent to stop you. These demons are found in caves throughout the valley floor, but in order to access these caves, you need to defeat some of the wild beasts that are scattered throughout the valley. When you kill these beasts, you will receive some gold, but when you are hit by these beasts, your energy will be lost. Some caves will appear when certain objects are struck with your sword. In some caves,you will find fairies, sorceresses, and wise women who will help you in many ways be increasing gold, giving you life potions, and restoring your energy.

There is a password save feature in this game. At the beginning of each area, you can enter a cave where a woman tells you what the password is, but if you die in the course of your quest, the password will already be revealed. By entering this password, you will be able to begin the game from the opening of the valley (if you get that far) with all your possessions intact.

One has the option to choose from the AFC league or the NFC league and then choose from several fabricated teams such as the Bombers, Sharks, Beavers or Bucks.
During gameplay, one must choose from a number of play formations. The player can choose from running and passing plays to field goals and punting plays when the time is right.
In a one-player game, the player only competes on offense. The game starts out with the CPU ahead in score and the player must try to score enough points to win. The CPU will automatically kick-off after a possession is over, there is no defense to be played. In a two-player game, there is both offense and defense to be played. One must try to do whatever possible to win, whether it be through touchdowns and field goals on offense or interceptions and safeties on defense.</resource>

Welcome to the Sega Master's Tournament where you need to play better than &amp;quot;par&amp;quot; if you want to win.

So tee-up for some real fun. And remember to play with caution. This championship course has been groomed for a truly competitive challenge. Eighteen holes full of roughs, bunkers, and water hazards will put your nerves to a real test.

But not to worry. You've got some clever moves to meet the challenge of a &amp;quot;dog leg&amp;quot; fairway or a tricky green. So go for a sneaky slice or hard hook to outplay the rest. Winner takes all! FORE!</resource>

Before going to her house, you decide to buy a present for her. You visit a shady foreign man's shop and buy an egg that he promises will hatch a cute pet. When Laila sees the egg, she recognizes it as a Mio egg, Mios being a rare animal that is thought to be extinct. Since you gave her the egg, it is your responsibility to find out how you keep a Mio. Still, the fact that you have a Mio egg should not be known to everyone, since scientists will be very keen to take the animal from you for purposes of their studies.

Your quest for the well-being, and eventual mystery, of the Mio animal takes you on a quest across several planets, not too far from the planet system of Phantasy Star. The game is controlled using an interface popular in Japanese adventures of the eighties, mostly identical with ICOM's interface used in adventures from the same era, such as Shadowgate or Déjà vu. You can talk to people in the game by deciding whom to talk to and the topic, but these interrogations have little in common with the more interactive LucasArts adventures. Finding out things is often a matter of repeatedly asking, asking at the right moment or in the right order. Battery-backed up RAM is not used for saving, instead you are given a password when quitting.</resource>

Or not, as this is a standard platform game with a twist of questionable taste and purpose. 

You play a crash test dummy, trying to progress through levels filled with hazards such as cars and fireballs, within the time limits. Contact with each of these loses you a limb, and once you have none left, contact means game over. Since the character isn’t handicapped by missing limbs in any way, in practical terms you can think of these as hit points  especially as there are screwdrivers to pick up which restore one limb.</resource>

Indy is armed with his trusty whip to fight off foes, but can also get involved in hand-to-hand combat. The first level takes place in caves underneath Colorado, before you reach a moving circus train strewn with traps, a Zeppelin which is full of guards and ladders, and then Castle Grunwald in Austria.

Pond has been armed with an Inspector Gadget-style stretch device, which he can use to view higher areas or claw onto ceilings so as to slide across them.

The gameplay takes place across worlds themed around particular types of toys, such as sporting goods, candy and aircraft. The levels scroll sideways, although a small amount of vertical movement is included. On each level Pond must collect 2 penguins and reach the exit, although there are usually multiple exits and lots of secret areas to explore. After completing each pair of two worlds (each of which has three sub levels), a boss must be faced.

In Joe Montana Football the player can play a game of American Football with Joe Montana giving the player basic tips on the next best move. The player can play against a friend or play the computer with 3 difficulty levels (beginner, normal, and professional) in a full game (5 min per quarter) using all the real rules and scoring. The teams are made up of 28 American city names with no team names (or player names) mentioned. Once the coin is flipped and the kick-off the game begins. 

The player controls the on-screen player as they try to run up the field. Once the player is downed the game turns to a play selection screen where the player can choose their next play (tactic) out of the 17 different preset plays available, as well as a punt, attempt at a field goal, or a turnover, all done in full view of the opponent (the CPU will change their play to match yours). More often then not Joe himself will give a tip on the best play that it will default to. On the field the player controlling the quarterback can throw it to the receiver (changing the player control to the receiver), change the receiver to pass to, or try to run with the quarterback. When play changes hands and the player becomes a defender the player has 6 defensive plays to choose from as well as a turnover. On the field the player controls a single player chosen by cycling though the players or selecting the player closest to the selected receiver. Two player mode works the same as single player but with a player instead of the computer.</resource>

Although most of the main elements remain the same, the most noticeable differences are in level design and some missing items.

The player controls Mowgli in his journey to the human village. Mowgli will swing on and climb vines, run and jump while facing enemies such as coconut-throwing monkeys, snakes and vampire bats. To fight them, Mowgli can throw bananas in eight directions. He'll also find upgrades and weapons such as boomerangs inside banana bunches. There are some boss fights with main characters of the movie, such as the snake Kaa.

The objective of each of the 10 time-limited levels (or &amp;quot;scenes&amp;quot;) is to collect gems scattered around them. Collecting certain amounts of gems grant access to bonus levels. The player starts the game with 4 lives and 1 continue.

    <resource id="87b999c179ad1a8e4b5e29df7cf48a19254702c3" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">One of many games based on the 1993 blockbuster Jurassic Park, the version for Sega's 8-bit systems combines side-scrolling shooting action and platforming levels.

In each of the five stages of the game, one escaped dinosaur species must be recaptured. Each level begins with a side-scrolling driving section. Dinosaurs attack the car and must be fend off by firing at them with a crosshair. If the player survives long enough, a boss battle against an especially powerful dinosaur follows.

After the completion of the driving section the level continues with a platform section. The player must jump, duck and climb to survive moving lifts, floors that will crumble under his feet, environmental hazards like acid drops, steam leaks or giant boulders and more. Dinosaurs will of course also stand in the way, but can be defeated by using several weapons: a rifle, a grenade launcher and hand grenades. Navigating the often maze-like levels will lead to the dinosaur that must be captured and a corresponding boss fight.

The first four levels (featuring a Velociraptor, Pteranodon, Triceratops and Brachiosaurus) can be tackled in any order, but the final level, featuring the Tyrannosaurus Rex, is only unlocked when the others have been completed.</resource>

Kenseiden is a one-player game that comprises of sixteen levels. Each of the levels are side-scrolling, with bamboo houses or dank, haunted caves as their backdrop. These levels see Hayato beseigned by ghosts, skeletons, and other spirits of the supernatural. On his side is his curved sword, which he can swish at will against the monsters. If Hayato comes in contact with a monster, he will lose some life.

At the end of each level, you will have to fight a warlock or one of their henchmen. More often than not, there is a hut with a sealed door, but the door is not unlocked unless a warlock or henceman is defeated. You gain a new special power whenever you recover a scroll from them. These special powers range from high jumping to the ability to whirl your sword around like a windmill.</resource>

If Graham takes these treasures back to the royal castle, then the ailing King Edward the Benevolent will hand over the crown. During his travels, Graham will meet characters that will either help or hinder him. 

You move Graham around with arrow keys, and perform actions by typing commands into the game, usually a verb/noun sequence. Some of the puzzles in the game rely on fairy tales, and a good knowledge of them is needed to complete them.

More often than not, there will be a boss that you need to defeat in order to continue the game. If you get hit by a ghost, you will start to lose life. If your life meter is empty, the game ends. In each chapter, you can shoot cracked walls, graves, and broken windows to get extra life or special attacks.</resource>

One day, a terrible shadow crept over the kingdom, threatening the lives of its inhabitants. The king's adviser said the only way to stop the shadow would be for the king himself to travel out and to seek the cure. But the cowardly king Pete preferred to stay in the castle, and sent a simple laundry boy named Mickey instead! 

As Mickey Mouse, you will travel through various levels in this platform game. Mickey shoots an unlimited amount of little balls on the enemies, can jump, climb on stairs, hang on ropes, and perform other tricks. Mickey can also pick up items and put them in another place, for example to access a higher level or to break a treasure chest open.</resource>

These creatures simply walk blindly through the world in the hope of reaching safety at the end of the level - unfortunately these levels include steep drops, gaps in the ground, barriers and rivers amongst other hazards.

You are in control not of any individual Lemming, but of a cross-hair, which can be moved over any of the Lemmings. Along the bottom are a selection of functions which can be assigned to a Lemming, including climbing, floating and bashing. You must click to select the appropriate function, then click on the Lemming to activate it. Each level has a different range of skills on offer, a different amount of Lemmings, and a different percentage target in order to progress.</resource>

The Lemmings have split into 12 distinct tribes, each of which has their own landscape and their own cultural identity - they include Egyptian, Circus and Highland. However, Lemming Island is now in danger, and you must complete 10 levels for each tribe in order for them to reunite and reassemble the Talisman from the 12 pieces.

Across the 120 levels there are over 60 skills, although no more than 10 are in use on each screen. The Classic tribe has the ones form the original and is perhaps the best option for first-time players.</resource>

Soon he is hunted by disgruntled enemy soldiers who want their toy back. The game takes the players through six levels controlling Jack in an armoured jeep. The gameplay is shown through a top-down perspective, with the screen scrolling vertically at a constant rate. The jeep cannot access the top part of the screen, only two thirds of it and getting stuck behind certain objects blows up the jeep.

The jeep is equipped with an unlimited amount of bullets and about 50 missiles per mission. Certain objects in the air can only be taken out using missiles. After launching them, players can apply &amp;quot;aftertouch&amp;quot; to guide towards the target by moving left or right. The settings, including a factory and a jungle, sometimes have obstacles, also requiring the jeep to jump over rivers. There are three difficulty levels, the vehicle can take multiple hits and there are three lives per continue.</resource>

His father is the current King of the Savannah and the young prince is able to frolic the lands at will; jumping on and around other subjects of this animal kingdom. When Simba's father, King Mufasa, is killed and his evil brother Scar takes over the kingdom, Simba is banished from the lands of his birthright and has to grow up fast, honing his skills, for the day of his return.

The Lion King, based on the famous Disney movie, is a platform game where you control Simba - initially as a young cub, and later as an adult lion. The plot of the game follows the plot of the movie. Each of the levels represents a part of the movie. 

As young Simba, you can fight various beasts, such as lizards, by jumping on them. You can also roar to scare some creatures into submission, though every time you roar, you have to wait for your &amp;quot;roar meter&amp;quot; to charge. 

As an adult lion, you can still roar and jump, but now you fight enemies by slashing at them with your claws (if you're skillful enough, you can also grab them and toss them off the screen). 

The game features no in-game save function, and it needs to be replayed from the beginning every time.

To pass the three tests, Landau must find the Tree of Marill, subdue the Goblin of Balala Valley, and destroy the Statue Of Evil.

Landau is controlled in a 3rd-person side-scrolling view. He can explore the world map (which can be seen by pressing the pause button) freely in a non linear way, but some portions of the map will be available only after defeating certain enemies or getting certain items. The Kingdom of Baljinya has towns and villages where Landau can stop to rest (restoring his health) and gather information from the people. There are also castles which can only be entered after completing certain tasks. Between those villages, towns and castles lie different kinds of terrains, like flatlands, dark forests, mountains and swamps. Those terrains are plagued by different kinds of monsters, some specific of each terrain.

There are two weapons which can be used by Landau: a sword and a bow. The sword can be used by pressing the button 2 while standing, kneeling or jumping. The bow can be used by pressing the button 1 only when standing or kneeling. Landau cannot walk and attack at the same time. Along his way he'll find new and stronger swords and bows.

Landau has only one life, but the game offers a continue feature which can be used up to 10 times.</resource>

Marksman Shooting and Trap Shooting were previously available as a bundle on a single cartridge, while Safari Hunt was released individually.

1. Marksman Shooting is a target practice game where one must shoot targets at an FBI shooting range. One must shoot the targets before they disappear and score enough points to qualify to the next round.

2. Safari Hunt is a hunting game where one must shoot as many animals with a limited amount of ammunition. One must shoot the various game animals to acquire enough points to advance to the next round.

3. Trap Shooting is a clay pigeon shooting game where one must shoot each disc as it is thrown into the air. One must shoot the pigeons before they disappear into the distance and score enough points to advance to the next round.

You play as a psychologist trying to defeat Dracula. This requires you to fight your way through several spooky locations such as cemeteries, laboratories, castles or a house of wax dolls. To defeat your enemies, you can use several primary and secondary weapons. Primary weapons are close combat weapons ranging from knifes to rapiers and axes, that differ in range and efficiency. Secondary weapons are long-range weapons (pistols, bombs etc.) with limited ammunition. The game features 5 Rounds divided into 3 stages. At the end of each stage, a boss must be defeated.</resource>

Finding strategic placings is important, especially as you can't shoot while on water. Most of the time you are on foot, but at times you can hijack vehicles of shot foes. There are improved weapons, smart bombs and energy recharges to collect. Each of the 8 levels ends with a large vehicle requiring multiple shots to destroy.</resource>

As he fell asleep, he woke up in the Kingdom of Beanwick, which is constantly tormented by earthquakes. Then, he offers his help to solve the mystery behind those earthquakes.

Mickey's Ultimate Challenge is a puzzle game in which the player chooses either Mickey or Minnie to play with. They'll find five characters from the Disney's universe in the kingdom, and will be prompted to help them in several tasks.

Each task is a different puzzle, given by a specific character. Daisy, for instance, will ask help to clean the castle's paintings hanging on a wall. The task is in fact a memory game, where Mickey or Minnie must clean the pictures matching pairs. After completing one task, they'll receive a gift.

After completing all tasks, Mickey or Minnie must trade the gifts they won with the right characters. For instance, after finishing Goofy's task, they will receive his hammer. The player must then guess who among the other characters would like to receive that hammer.

Giving the right items to the right characters will allow Mickey or Minnie access to the last puzzle and character.</resource>

    <resource id="0ba7fefcc70509f0a2efa06fdadd6774bd2a1293" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">If you're bored of racing Formula 1 cars, rally cars or MotoGP bikes in their natural habitats, the Micro Machines series could be for you. It involves racing miniatures representing particular vehicle types across a particular terrain found around the house. The Sports Cars race on the desktop, 4x4s in the sandpit, Formula 1 cars on a snooker table, and so on.

These levels were packed with variation. The Snooker tables has the track painted on, although this is open to deviation (as are most levels), and had you racing through the pockets and across the rim of the table. Tanks raced as well, with the chance of shooting out your opponent if they got directly in front of you. The desktop levels include binders to jump across, pencil-sharpeners to avoid, and lots of visual jokes in the open homework.

Viewed from overhead with small graphics, the races include up to 4 cars. In one player challenge mode you race through the 21 tracks in a set order, selecting your 3 opponents as you go along (adding a fair amount of strategy - ideally you should aim to eliminate the better CPU cars early on), eliminating one after every third race (assuming that you can finish in the top 2 of a race within your 3 lives). If you win 3 races in a row without using a continue you get a time-trial race which can earn you an extra life.

The real innovation of the game was in the multiplayer modes. You started with 4 points each, and when one car gets far enough ahead to force the other car off-screen, the slider moves in their favour. Once it reached the end (which involved beating them 4 times more than they beat you) you win the level, although if 3 laps were completed, the person leading at that point is declared the winner - with a sudden death play off if scores are level. 9 of the tracks are available in this mode, although you can also play this Head to Head system as a 1-player game across all the tracks.

You start your quest by yourself, but you must find three other companions who will join you to defeat Terarin. You also must venture through five lands. You will find villages, towns and castles in your travels in these lands. In each, you will find or be able to buy weapons and armor (both for you and your companions), medicine and...clues. You will also find caves, dungeons, and monuments that are scattered. Some you may enter unhindered. Others will be locked...until you find the right person or learn the right spell. 

Also within each land, you will encounter monsters such as evil merchants, Weasly wimps, Unmutaks, Great Lions, Gelfises, Zirods, and many more. Some of these monsters do less damage than others, and  take more damage themselves. You can either attack them yourself using your weapons or spells, or make your companions attack the monsters themselves. When defeated, most monsters will either leave behind some coins, which you can spend to buy stuff at the towns, or some items, which you can also use to defeat monsters.

However, not all inhabitants are monsters. You will also meet merchants and travelers who might tell you where to go and what to do.

But beware, the catacombs are a large maze inhabited by monsters. Bouncing and rolling skulls, dancing spiders, disappearing and re-appearing chains and tons of fire await you. You'll have to find many keys and unlock doors in order to reach your goal. Panama Joe can jump and climb ladders, but doesn't have much to offer in terms of combat. That's why the monsters in the game should be avoided: a collision with an enemy leads to a premature death.</resource>

Shang was accompanied by Prince Goro, a warrior of the Shokan race (a four armed half-human/half-dragon). Knowing that if ten tournaments in a row were won by the Outworld champion, the Earth Realm would be conquered by evil and fall into darkness, Shang entered Goro in the tournament and had him defeat the great Kung Lao. Goro has been  reigning supreme as the undefeated fighting champion for five hundred years now. As the last tournament required draws near, Raiden, Thunder God and protector of the Earth Realm, enacts a plan to tip the scales in the humans favor, Seven fighters step into the arena on Shang Tsung's mysterious island: Shaolin warrior Liu Kang, Special Forces operative Sonya Blade, the mercenary thug Kano, fame-seeking actor Johnny Cage, the ice wielding Lin Kuei warrior Sub-Zero and his undead adversary Scorpion, and Raiden himself.

Mortal Kombat is a side-scrolling 1 on 1 fighting game. Fighting is set as one on one kombat, allowing each player to perform a variety of punches, kicks, and special moves in order to defeat their opponent.  When the opponent faces their second round loss, the winner can perform a finishing move called a &amp;quot;Fatality&amp;quot; on the loser.  The Fatality is a move unique to each fighter that graphically kills the loser in a blood-soaked finale.

Mortal Kombat began its life as a 2-player arcade title. It is notable for its use of digitized actors to represent the game's fighters, as well as its use of copious amounts of blood during gameplay.</resource>

In order to revive his Queen Sindel, the emperor Shao Kahn used the Outworld Tournament from Mortal Kombat 2 as a diversion while his Shadow Priests revive his fallen Queen on Earth. Once enacted, the dimensional bridge between the two realms connects, allowing Kahn's extermination squads to invade and destroy Earth, and enslave the population's souls.

A small team of Raiden's &amp;quot;Chosen Warriors&amp;quot; survives the attack: Mortal Kombat champion Liu Kang and his ally Kung Lao, Special Forces agents Sonya Blade and Jax, the shaman Nightwolf, the riot cop Stryker, the nomadic Kabal, and former Lin Kuei warrior Sub-Zero, who has gone rogue from his clan. Facing the warriors are the mercenary Kano, cyber-ninjas Smoke, Sektor and Cyrax, Sheeva, a female Shokan, the sorcerer Shang Tsung, and Queen Sindel herself.

Mortal Kombat 3 brings new elements to the 2D fighting series: multi-level playfields, &amp;quot;Dial-A-Combo&amp;quot; attacks, a &amp;quot;Run&amp;quot; button to speed up the battles, and &amp;quot;Vs.&amp;quot; codes, which unlock new powers and abilities once both players enter a code sequence in pre-match-up screens. Also included are more stage fatalities and finishing moves as each warrior attempts to go one-on-one with the Centaurian enforcer Motaro, and Shao Kahn himself.

Mortal Kombat 3 is the last traditional one-on-one fighting game game in the series to feature motion-captured digitized graphics for its kombatants, and introduces online network play to the PC version.</resource>

To win the main tournament, the player must beat each of the other human players, before taking on Shang Tsung, Kintaro and finally Shao Kahn. Players have a range of punches and kicks available, as well as flying kicks, uppercuts, roundhouses, and the special moves, which vary for each player. These include throws, uppercuts, long-distance bullets, bicycle kicks and a teleport feature.</resource>

This sequel continued on the &amp;quot;eat the dots/avoid the ghosts&amp;quot; gameplay of the original game, but added new features to keep the title fresh.

Like her boyfriend, Ms. Pac-Man attempts to clear four various and challenging mazes filled with dots and ever-moving bouncing fruit  while avoiding Inky, Blinky, Pinky and Sue, each with their own personalities and tactics.  One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Ms. Pac-Man.

Ms. Pac-Man can turn the tables on her pursuers by eating one of the four Energizers located within the maze. During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Ms. Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points (ranging from 200, 400, 800 and 1600, progressively). The Energizer power only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghost's eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Ms. Pac-Man again.

Survive a few rounds of gameplay, and the player will be treated to humorous intermissions showing the growing romantic relationship between Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man, leading all the way up to the arrival of &amp;quot;Junior&amp;quot;.</resource>

A key feature of NBA Jam was the exaggerated nature of the play - players jumped many times above their own height, making slam dunks that defied both human capabilities and the laws of physics. There were no fouls, free throws, or violations except goaltending and 24 second violations. This meant the player was able to freely shove or elbow his opponent out of the way. Additionally, the game had an &amp;quot;on fire&amp;quot; feature, where if one player made three baskets in a row, he would become &amp;quot;on fire&amp;quot; and have unlimited turbo, no goaltending, and increased shooting ability, until the other team scored (or the player had scored four consecutive baskets while &amp;quot;on fire&amp;quot;).</resource>

    <resource id="0150abe0aaadfe3146cc4a6e64c77e833b563ed7" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">One day, a kiwi tribe was having fun and games outside the zoo, only to be kidnapped by the evil-minded Leopard Seal, who plans to sell them at the black market. Fortunately, during the kidnapping process, Tiki, leader of the tribe, managed to escape the sack, and her job is to rescue Phee-Phee and the other kiwis scattered around New Zealand, and are held in cages in various locations that include Auckland, Rotorua, Waitomo Caves, Strait Cook, and Mt. Cook. 

If Tiki doesn't rescue a kiwi in a limited amount of time, the devil will appear and try to kill her. When Tiki reaches the outskirts of each city, except Strait Cook, there is a boss waiting to meet Tiki, and kill her by using their own choice of weapons. Also making the rescue mission difficult are several nasties that attempt to throw their own weapons, like bombs and arrows, at her. To defeat these enemies, Tiki shoots at them using her crossbow and arrows. More often than not, when Tiki shoots at enemies, they will leave behind pieces of fruit that she can pick up for points. However, it is likely that Tiki may get other weapons or the letters E, X, T, E, N, and D. Collecting all these letters will result in an extra life, and as for the weapons, they include laser shots, bombs, and fireballs. 

In some levels, a few areas are located further up than just left or right, and the only way that Tiki can go up is by snatching something off the enemy that gives her the ability to fly up. Other areas are underwater, and when Tiki goes underwater, her oxygen  meter decreases, so she has to rise up to the surface again to restore her oxygen levels. Apart from her own weapons, Tiki is able to squirt water at enemies if she gets to the top of the water.</resource>

The story is also about the original protagonist, the Dragon ninja Ryu Hayabusa, who returns to his clan's village only to find it utterly destroyed and the inhabitants murdered. A single survivor tells Ryu in his last seconds that the Sacred Scroll of Bushido was stolen. With the power of the scroll its owner is mighty enough the gain control of the whole world. Thus Ryu swears to recapture the scroll and the avenge the annihilation of his clan.

The game is sidescrolling platformer/ beat'em up title and incorporates most of the mechanics from the NES games: Ryu can jump and attack with his Dragon Sword. Furthermore, he can collect different kinds of Ninja Magic (which again vary form the powers in the NES games), from shuriken to fire wheels, which can only be used finitely many times, as the use up energy which again must be collected. However, instead of clinging to walls and climbing them, Ryu can push himself off the wall in this game, which must be applied for instance by jumping and forth between two close walls to get higher and higher.

The goal of each level is simply to reach the end of the level before the time runs out. Each level is divided into several sections, and at the end of each level is a boss fight. After beating a boss, a cut scene is shown which continues the story about Ryu's quest for the Bushido scroll and his revenge.</resource>

Gyokuro, an evil emperor, gained power and his oppressive rule caused great hardship to the people, and the princess who opposed him was confined to a dungeon somewhere in the Ohkami castle. Gyokuro has the Ohkami ninja under control at his command. Utilizing various ninjitsu techniques, in addition to the one that transforms them into a wolf, they protect him from the people who are his enemies.

You play Kazamuru, a great warrior who challenges the clan to a fight in order to rescue the princess. However, he can't rescue the princess unless he finds the five scrolls in the thirteen areas of Ohkami. On his quest, he must defeat various ninjas such as Kuno-ichi and Ninniku, as well as fire-blowing ninjas, slashing ninjas, and footloose ninjas. You'll explore grassy fields, shrines, river banks,  towns, and the castle itself. Some of the steps have varied gameplay. For example, you must avoid boulders in Step 2, must use logs in order to cross a river in Step 5, avoid being trampled on by horses in Step 7, and scale a cliff in Step 9.</resource>

    <resource id="185c120cd993febce04d0e20be26b0a84b235178" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">The official game of the Games of the XXV Olympiad, held in Barcelona in 1992, featuring seven different events: 100M Sprint, Hammer Throw, Archery, 110M Hurdles, Pole Vault, Springboard diving and 200M Freestyle Swimming.

Gameplay features the typical button mashing formula used by Epyx during the 80s. 100M Sprint, 110M Hurdles and 200M Freestyle Swimming feature a button mashing sequence with just some changes: in the hurdles the player must hit the action key to jump over a hurdle (the timing sets the loss of speed) and in swimming, the sequence takes over one and an half minutes and the action button touches the edge for the return swim. In these events, the player initially faces a semi-final round and only qualifies for the final if ends in the top half. It's possible to watch the other semi-final.
Hammer Throw combines a strong mashing sequence, along an accurate press of the action button to release the hammer, while Pole Vault combines an initial mashing sequence, a first tap on down to set the bar, then pressing up and the action button to release the pole and jump over the bar. Archery is a technical event where the player has three rounds with six arrows each, the winner being the one with the highest score on all three rounds.

The player can choose to compete for eight nations: Great Britain, France, Germany, Italy, hosts Spain, United Stats, Japan and the CIS (formerly the Soviet Union). Each nation has it's own sample of the anthem and a set of athletes to compete against the player. Each athlete is unique, and will perform differently according the the event: in some they are capable of braking World Records, in others, lucky enough to get to a final or a top-6 spot. The competition is split in two tables: sorted by medals and by total score (the gold medalist gets 24 points, the 12th only 13).

It is a &amp;quot;rail-shooter&amp;quot;, where you basically hold the gun and shoot just about everything that moves, while conserving your ammo and grenades.  Your primary machine gun can kill everything if you hit it enough times, but you can also use the grenade launcher for really deadly targets like helicopters or armored cars. You can collect a machine gun which will allow you to shoot faster for a few seconds.
You'll be pummelled by a LOT of enemies. Some will be shooting, others will be tossing grenades, knifes, ... Some are armored and requires more than a few hits, others dodges. You can shoot grenades and knifes out of the air if you aim well enough.
Bosses appear at the end of some levels, and each has a specific weakness you need to exploit.</resource>

It's an ordinary evening, and Bruno's dad is working late at office. Reason enough for Bruno's vivid imagination to run riot, thinking that his dad has been kidnapped by aliens! Jelly babies, that fell from his father's pocket on the way to work, blaze a trail to the office. Now it's up to Bruno to fight his way through hordes of terrorizing toys, Ottifant-eating plants, tear through gloomy caverns of doom and cut across a perilous jungle - workaday objects and boringly normal settings as seen through kids' eyes - and rescue his dad!

The Ottifants for the SEGA Game Gear is a 2D side-scrolling platformer where the player controls Bruno through five worlds: starting with the house and the basement, through to the building site, the office and finally the jungle, whereas each world is in turn divided into three stages. Bruno's primary weapon is his trunk, which gives him the ability to blast enemies by firing sweets at them, or suck in objects like out-of-reach platforms or boxes by holding down the Fire-button. Furthermore, yellow, green and red lollies are spread throughout the stages. Gathering three of them activate one of Bruno's special skills and can - depending on the colour combination - transform the baby Ottifant into Superfant with the ability to fly, boost his speed with Speedy Shoes, give an extra Continue and more. 

Picking up jelly babies, blasting enemies and collecting papers gives points and raises Bruno's score up to a fixed value of 9,999 pts. There are several entrances to secret rooms hidden in the five worlds. But, unlike the Genesis-version, the rooms are quite small and basic and there is no 1,000 point reward by completing them. On the whole there are two different tunes backing your journey through the game: one for the stages and one for the boss enemies. The varied background music and sound effects of the Genesis-game are completely missing, as is one entire world: The Garden.</resource>

Your Ferrari is at the ready, complete with female passenger, over a series of short tracks.

Gameplay is viewed form just above and behind the car, so you can see it. The roads are full of sharp bends and hazards, contact with which can cause the car to roll and lose you time. On each section of track there is a fork in the road, allowing you to choose which direction you go in. You have to complete 5 track sections in total, out of the 15 in the game.</resource>

Little else is modified. You still drive a red Ferrari on a road which forks into more and more levels. The main differences are the levels, which look slightly different, the fact that your Ferrari is slightly smaller than the original Master System conversion, and that there are three new sound tracks to choose from; Midnight Highway, Color Ocean and Shining Wind. The original Magical Sound Shower is still left for the traditionalists.

The three-click control method (the first to start the swing, the second setting power and over-swing, the third setting draw or fade) allowed for a multitude of different shots, and required a sense of timing. 

Four courses are included, one of them a fantasy 'links' course designed by the programmers. Some of the holes are fiendish, with bunkers, water hazards and trees, and the need to plan strategies to get the best approach to the green.

When playing a tournament there are 60 opponents, each representing top US golfers - ten of these appear with tactical advice for each hole.</resource>

You need to guide Pac-Man around a maze and eat all of the dots on the board in order to proceed on to the next round. Numerous, multi-colored ghosts also roam the maze trying to stop you. If you eat one of the power pellets in the maze, the ghosts will temporarily turn blue and run from you. Pac-man can earn bonus points by eating the ghosts when they are in this state. The maze is now in 3-D and is larger than screen which will scroll to follow the action. To help get out of tight spots, Pac-Man now has the ability to jump. But be careful, because some of the ghosts have learned this trick as well and you could end up in a mid air collision!</resource>

This game is the very first installment in the long-lived Phantasy Star series. It is a futuristic RPG that uses a turn-based combat system (viewed from first-person perspective). An unusual feature of this game is that some locations are also viewed from first-person perspective. You can explore those locations by moving forward or backward, and the environments are in pseudo-3D.</resource>

To win, you must help your chosen people take over the world and wipe out the vermin who worship that other god.

Each god starts out with a single human, dumped into the middle of the wilderness.  Sometimes there is inhabitable land in sight, sometimes not.  To get win, you must change the landscape, creating flat land for your followers to build on.  The more followers you have you have, the more powerful you will be, so take care of them. Build as fast as you can, because the other god is doing the same.

When you have enough followers, you can make the leader of your people into a hero.  He will then go around the land you have built, literally taking strength from the people into himself, and working his way toward the enemy.  When he gets there, he will engage in holy warfare upon your enemy's people.  He will burn; he will kill.  And he won't stop until they're all dead... or he is.

But you don't have to let your people have all the fun; the god's have other tools as well.  You can drown your enemies one at a time with your land lowering powers.  Submerge their towns in swamps. Raise a volcano in the middle of their best farmland.  Even better, you can flood the land and drain all the people who didn't build on high-ground. 

And when you win, you'll have 500 more worlds to conquer.  A god's play is just never done.</resource>

To do this, you must go out at sea with a submarine and destroy several enemy targets. Once you have defeated each enemy target, the mission is completed, and, upon completing some of them, your rank increases. Before defeating each target, however, you also need to destroy enemy jets, choppers, and submarines who will launch missiles or rockets at you. If you are hit by any of these, damage is inflicted to the submarine, but you can shoot down any of the missiles or rockets. You will need to keep an eye on the built-in radar and sonar to find out where enemies will hit next. Your fuel is limited, and can be increased by destroying certain enemies. The game ends when your submarine is destroyed or you run out of fuel.</resource>

Only one force can stop the evil vegetables from taking root: Power Strike, the most versatile jet fighter in the world.  Blast the enemy in the air and and on the ground and save the planet from the creeping green menace. 

There are six rounds to complete (three in the mobile version). In each round, numbers (from 1 to 8) can be found on the ground either enclosed by a ring, or in the air carried by a ship. Getting these numbers will upgrade your firepower. Get more of the same number for a maximum upgrade. Unfortunately, whatever the type of firepower you get, you will have a limited supply of ammo, so you need to stock up on the same type of firepower if you get too low. 

At the end of each round, there is an end-of-round boss which involves shooting parts of its base in order to destroy it. Intermediate bosses can be found in the last three rounds (console version only).</resource>

Power Strike II is a top-down shooter where you must select which weapon you want to use during the game, and then fight your way through various stages, destroying both air- and ground-based enemies along the way. You can upgrade your weapons by collecting power-ups that can only be found by shooting specific ships. You will need to defeat the end-of-level boss (by destroying parts of it) in order to proceed to the next level.</resource>

Mike has to fight drug dealers and must rescue a certain number of hostages at each level. The Predator's three-dotted laser aim is a menace to avoid, which can kill either the hostages or Mike himself. Gang members killed drop drugs which can be picked up for points (and sent to the drugs squad). At the end of each level a boss must be defeated.

Mike can move and shoot in all 8 directions, but can only stop and shoot up, down, left and right. Besides his pistol, Mike can also collect new weapons such as grenades, shotguns, machine-guns and rifles. Body armor can be collected for health and med kits for extra lives.</resource>

Now go, you've got 60 minutes!

Prince of Persia is a 2D platformer with run and jump gameplay. Your hero must avoid deadly traps, solve some simple puzzles and engage in sword fights with the guards. The player has an infinite amount of lives, but has to restart at the beginning of a level each time he dies, and must complete the game within an hour. An especially noteworthy aspect of the game is the very fluent animation of your character.

The Game Boy Color and SNES versions of the game feature additional levels and new enemies. The Genesis version has a new intro and an altered set of graphics but the level layout remains almost identical to that of the original.</resource>

These tag teams are the Mad Soldiers, the Orient Express, the Great Maskmen and the Crush Brothers and they all have something to prove. Each wrestler has his own special moves ranging anywhere from knee butts and body slams to flying head butts and pile drivers. The Mad Soldiers and the Great Maskmen can also use metal chairs to hit their opponents outside the ring while the Orient Express and the Crush Brothers have the capability of climbing onto the turnbuckle and releasing damaging blows to their opponents. Each wrestler can also bounce off the ropes to release a running attack. When a wrestler is low on health, he can tag his teammate in to carry on in the match.
Compete in three sets of ten fall matches to complete the game. The matches are the Mexican League, the Pacific League and finally the World League. Pin the opponent ten times in a league to move on to the next.</resource>

    <resource id="b17a11cd5e8312d366a8b8a0aa0e4c5774c0e979" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Psycho Fox is a platform game where you play a fox and you must get through seven worlds, consisting of three areas each. At the end of each world, there are one of seven bosses waiting to destroy you, but some of the later bosses are exactly the same as the earlier ones. The title is a bit misleading because you can also play as three other characters including Hippo, Leopard, and Monkey Boy. Each character has their own disadvantages. For example, Hippo is much slower than the other three. However, all the characters share one thing in common: they can use their fists and punch enemies as they approach them. They can also jump on them and keep knocking them in the ground until they disappear off the face of the earth. If they don't make them disappear, they will pop back out again and set out for revenge. Obstacles are scattered through each area, including spikes, cannonballs, esculators, fireballs, and steam.

You start the game with three lives. Once you touch an enemy, you lose a life. Lose any of your lives, and the game is over. If the game is over, you can continue where you left off. There are several items to find, and these can help you on your quest, and one of these items are eggs. If you break any of these eggs, either the &amp;quot;switch&amp;quot; item or the invincibility item is revealed. If you're lucky enough, a white bag is also revealed, but more often than not, one of your enemies can pop out from inside the egg. One egg will reveal a bird which you can carry for the rest of the game. This bird may be nothing but a pest, as it hinders your progress, but you can throw it at enemies to knock them out. It can also be used as a backup, meaning that you can have enemies touching you, but it is the bird that is killed, not you.

There is little chance that you'll find a white bag inside an egg, unless you go up into a secret area, which can often be found if you jump on springs that are scattered throughout the level. These white bags are useless, until you get to the bonus areas, which are at the end of each area. In these bonus stages, you can place a number of foxes on a path depending on how much white bags you've collected throughout each area.

When you complete Psycho Fox, you are treated to a funny ending.</resource>

Now they must find the Shaven Yak and return him his hooves, or there won't be any more Yak shaving days!

In this platform game the player is prompted to choose playing either as Ren or Stimpy at the start of new life or some stages. Both can jump and shoot (Ren shoots toothbrushes, Stimpy spits), but each one has his own special ability: Ren can perform high jumps, Stimpy can smash things jumping over them. Each character starts the game with three lives.

Throughout levels such as &amp;quot;The Blacker Than Black Forest&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;The Stinking Dry Desert&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;The Stinking Wet Bayou&amp;quot;, Ren and Stimpy will face most animal enemies, such as birds, frogs, vultures, woodpeckers, snakes, etc. The levels are divided in few or several sub-level, and at the end of each level, they'll face a boss.

They'll also find some unusual weapons, as a slice of bread (which flies in circles), a remote controller (which casts electric waves) and a soap bar (which casts bubbles). If they get hit when using a weapon, they'll lose it, but won't lose health. They'll gain health by picking items like TVs, cash bags, bottles and boots.

You control the R-9 spaceship as it launches a last-ditch effort to repel the evil Bydo empire.

The R-9 comes equipped as standard with a small gun which can only take down the smallest of enemies without firing several shots. By holding down the fire button, it can be loaded up so as to release a large burst of energy, eliminating all but the strongest enemies in its path. From time to time, pods will come flying in your direction. Upon being shot, they release an upgrade. The first one will invariably be the one called &amp;quot;The Force&amp;quot;, which is a weapons pod that clings either to the front or the back of your ship, absorbing any enemy bullets or acting as a bumper with which you can fly head-on into them. You can also use it as an offensive weapon by firing it and pulling it back in. Mastering the Force is vital to surviving in R-Type, since it must be used both as protection against bullet clusters, as a remote controlled cannon, and in order to clear the screen from obstacles. Other upgrades give you target-seeking missiles or a bigger main gun. Different gun types, differentiated by their colour, serve different purposes. The blue one sends laser beams bouncing across the screen (good for tunnels), the red one fires straight ahead, and the yellow one follows any walls it may encounter (good for artillery emplacements).

The stages of R-Type are made in an organic style, certainly inspired by H. R. Giger's artwork for the Alien movies. When it came out, it was considered trend-setting since it broke off from the stereotypical sci-fi mould of other shoot'em'ups. In part, the levels themselves are your enemy, which is exemplified by the fourth, where spider-like creatures weave webs that cover the screen and block your path, or levels with intricate tunnel systems. Still, the levels are best handled with a combination of strategy and reflexes, without the memorisation that is required of R-Type's contemporary rival, Gradius.</resource>

He is being held captive in a prison camp. 

For weapons you have an AK-47 and grenades. You can pick up grenades by blasting open containers such as pots and crates. Use your fire-power to destroy all enemies and you will continue to the next stage.

The first stage is a Soviet army base packed with plenty soldiers. The next stage is a village where the soviets are hiding. Then the rest of the levels are Mountain, Prison Camp, Soviet camp (escape during night), Cave attack, then the final stage where you fight the Mil Hind Helicopter.</resource>

Build your castle from Tetris-style pieces, place your cannons, bombard the enemy, try to repair, do it all over again. Later arcade revisions incorporated 3-player,  and the PC conversion does as well, making it a faithful, entertaining classic for multiple players on the same PC.</resource>

The game is set on the mean streets of Brooklyn, which you must venture through to meet your girlfriend, and then rescue her from her kidnappers. This is split into five levels, taking you through the subway and the docks as well as some inhospitable streets. A wide range of aggressive moves are on offer, including headbutts, kicks, punches and flying kicks. Much of the game's violence is depicted in a fairly tongue-in-cheek style, with an element of attempted humour along the way.</resource>

Starting at the back of the pack the objective is always to finish first on a linear course, overtaking the other bikers. This is achieved by driving very well or by playing it dirty, knocking opponents of their bikes using clubs, crowbars or your bare hands. The other racers fight back in a similar fashion and there are also hazards. All the races take place on the regular road with normal traffic and the cops, as well as occasional oil slicks and stray cows.

By winning races you can get promoted to a stronger division and earn cash with which you can buy a better bike. Whenever you're knocked off your bike or hit something you will have to run back to your bike and lose valuable time, plus your bike will suffer some damage.</resource>

One of the resistances' soldiers, Flo is sent back in time before the Rise of the Machines to destroy Robocop and stop Skynet from being built. However Skynet learns of the time travel attempt and sends Terminators to stop Flo.

In the game you control Robocop who may move across the screen, jump, fire and exchange weapons. Robocop starts with the Auto-9 which has unlimited ammunition... other weapons may be more powerful but contain limited ammo. Beginning the game on a mission of law enforcement, you soon meet up with Flo and must engage in battle against Terminators, the forces of OCP and several obstacles

This game reflects the Rocky series quite well. Only in this game you go one guy to the next. From Apollo the remaining champion, to Lang an aggressive contender, to Drago the Soviet boxer who trains constantly. Before you have a fight just like in the &amp;quot;Rocky&amp;quot; movies you have to train. Practice your timing and punching strength with some sandbag punching before fighting Apollo.  Warm up punching a punching ball to become more faster and smarter to get ready for Lang. Then you will do some punching mitts training before fighting Drago where you watch the mitts and punch at the as they move. All of these trainings have qualifications such as punches per second, qualify and your combinations get better for the following fight. 

During a fight you only have one meter under your name, that is the power meter. Your opponent has one likewise. Watching your power bar can tell you a lot about which way the fight is headed, either it's full and you can take more punches and punch more powerfully or it's low and you're in  trouble. Watching the opponents power bar will tell you when to take him down or when to block.

Between rounds you get a chance to freshen up and get some last minute coaching. During the one minute interval, your power will go up only half of what has been drained. 

If you do happen to take a fall the controls are similar to Nintendos &amp;quot;Punch out&amp;quot;, basically you just press the 1 and 2 buttons as fast as possible. Hopefully Rocky stands up and is ready for more.</resource>

Once Sapo Xulé knew it, he left the swamp and went to Japan to fight Naja and his gang, and free his master.

Sapo Xulé: O Mestre do Kung Fu (which means Sapo Xulé: the Master of Kung Fu) is a modified version of Kung Fu Kid, with its main character replaced by Sapo Xulé, a character based on a popular toy in Brazil back in the 80's: a toad with shoes which, when taken off, release a really bad smell.

In this side-scrolling/platform game, Sapo Xulé will fight his enemies kicking (button 1) and jumping (button 2) along seven rounds, fighting a boss at the end of each round, except for round six, which has several bosses to fight. From time to time shurikens will appear; by shooting them (pressing up and button 1), Sapo Xulé can clear the way in front of him. Some enemies will try to hold Sapo Xulé: to release himself he'll have to move fast.

All rounds have a 99 seconds time limit. Sapo Xulé starts with 3 lives and no continues.</resource>

The lagoon animals became desperate and sought the wise Cágado Adão for help. He quickly found the solution: to build a heavily armored submarine, to destroy the facilities and send the invaders back home. Sapo Xulé was asked to perform this mission and destroy the powerful scientists' submarine ships.

Sapo Xulé: S.O.S. Lagoa Poluída (which means Sapo Xulé: S.O.S. Polluted Lagoon) is a modified version of Astro Warrior, with its space ship replaced by a submarine ship driven by Sapo Xulé, a character based on a popular toy in Brazil back in the 80's: a toad with shoes which, when taken off, release a really bad smell.

This game is a basic shoot-em-up, but instead of destroying space ships and aliens, the player must destroy the scientists' facilities and clean up the lagoon, by destroying the trash in it – the lagoon is filled with matches, eaten apples, cotton swabs, boots and other kinds of junk.

Sapo Xulé's ship can be upgraded by collecting leaves (which will make it faster) and flies inside bubbles (which will improve its fire power). There are also satellite weapons that can be attached to the ship.

The game consists in three levels, at the end of which Sapo Xulé must destroy one scientist's submarine. Once all the three scientists are defeated, they are revived and Sapo Xulé is sent back where he started, in a never-ending circle.</resource>

He also kidnapped Rãzinha, Sapo Xulé's girlfriend, to make her his princess. Now, Sapo Xulé, along with his three friends (Ratopulga, Porcopum and Tartafede) must to stop the cruel tyrant.

Sapo Xulé vs. Os Invasores do Brejo (which translates Sapo Xulé vs. The Swamp Invaders) is a modified version of Psycho Fox, with its main character replaced by Sapo Xulé, a character based on a popular toy in Brazil back in the '80s; a toad with shoes which, when taken off, release a really bad smell.

In Psycho Fox, the player could also play as three other characters during the game: Hippo, Monkey Boy and Leopard. In Sapo Xulé vs. Os Invasores do Brejo, they were replaced by Porcopum (a pig), Ratopulga (a mouse) and Tartafede (a turtle).

Each character has its own special ability: Porcopum can break rock walls (but he's considerably slower than the others). Ratopulga can jump higher than any other character, while Tartafede is the fastest one. Sapo Xulé is the most balanced of them.

In this side-scrolling/platform game, all characters can kill their enemies by punching or jumping on top of them, until they are completely buried. If they are not buried completely, the enemies will pop out of the ground and come after the character again. Besides the monsters, other common obstacles are spikes, cannonballs, fireballs, pits and more.

The characters can also find Sapo Xulé's stinky shoes, which can be used as a boomerang-like weapon. If they are hit when carrying the shoe, they'll just lose it instead of dying.

To switch among the characters, the player must find green potions, usually hidden inside eggs, or carried by enemies. Other special items can be collected, such as &amp;quot;invincibility flies&amp;quot;, Sapo Xulé's stinky socks (which kill every enemy on the screen) and some white bags, which are meant to be used at the bonus stages.

The bonus stages consist of labyrinths with several paths, each leading to prizes or nothing at all. Each white bag collected at the main stages give the player an extra character to set up for a different path at the labyrinth, raising the chances of reaching a prize in the end.

Apart from changes in the main characters, some enemy sprites were replaced, such as the first boss - which came to be Sibila, the sorceress snake - and obviously the last one - which came to be Sapo Boi.</resource>

Though the game did not officially leave Japan in card form, the game has appeared in several compilations in Brazil, including the Tectoy DVD Karaoke Game DVT-G100.</resource>

They set off to find the 21 crystals in each area and smurf the world's rubbish in order to get back to their European village. 

So you as male Smurf or female Smurfette should travel from one continent to another. The continents represent North Pole, Africa, Asia, North America, South America, and Australia, and each of them consists of 3 levels. On each level character should collect certain number of crystal shards, which in sum gives 21 crystal shards. During the level character should collect other items to raise a score, avoid or eliminate the enemies specific for each area jumping over them, swim somewhere, or run away from cougar.

The enemies re spawn so you have to keep battling upwards as staying in the same place for to long means you get surrounded by the enemy. Freeing prisoners involves you blowing up the huts they are in with your bow and you are awarded with more arrows for doing this.

The game was tidied up and changed in a number of areas. The most significant change is the addition of red and yellow cards for discipline (2 yellow card offenses or one ‘professional foul’ (denying your opponent a clear goal-scoring opportunity) results in that player being sent off). The goalkeepers have been improved in skill, and the 1994 World Cup Qualifying tournament was added.

Well, if you tell it to, the dog will maul enemies (provided that the dog barks at them when you face them) and distract them long enough so that you can shoot at them. Remember that you have a limited time to do this, as the enemy will eventually kick the dog off him. This causes the dog to yelp and shrink, making him powerless against them.

He grew up on drugs made to destroy his own will and turn him into the Beast Messenger, a powerful creature serving Maletoth, The Beast Lord himself. He did his job, until one day he noticed a man about to be sacrificed in a ritual, his face triggering ancient memories... and as the sacrificial knife descended into the man's body, Aarbron recognizes the face. Of his father.
As his father dies in the altar, memories of his childhood and tormented past at the hands of the Beast Lord emerged, and as feelings of hate over his captors took over him, he swore revenge and fled the temple, knowing the road to avenge his father and redemption would be hard.

Shadow of the Beast, one of Psygnosis most popular titles during the 16-bit computer era is a side-scrolling platformer best known for the use of parallax scrolling along lush graphics, a musical score  by David Whittaker, a iconic cover by Roger Dean and what many consider to be unforgiving gameplay, balancing between the &amp;quot;very challenging&amp;quot; and the &amp;quot;impossible&amp;quot;. The player has to navigate through several areas filled with enemies and traps, collecting keys and activating triggers than open new areas or give Aarbron the means to overcome a sub-boss. The number of moves the player has at disposal is limited: duck, jump and only two attacks: punch and a flying kick. While most enemies die with just one hit, the player must time each attack accurately. However, there are also traps of objects that cannot be destroyed, and these require the player to jump, duck or move according the sequence. The player has only one life with 12 hit points that can be replenished by collecting some objects hidden in the level (like an off-route location or a under a megalith), which also contributes to the difficulty level.</resource>

The gameplay involves 144 tiles, each depicting different images, which have to be removed by matching them into pairs. The tiles are arranged in a gridded pattern, which is higher near the centre. A tile can only be removed if it has no tile next to it on at least one side.

This computer implementation can generate a random board layout to take on, as well as featuring 5 preset challenges, some of which have time limits of 5 or 10 minutes, as well as a multiplayer mode.</resource>

The targets include birds, balloons, blimps, balls, and spaceships; some difficult, some not so difficult. As you progress through the rounds, the game gets difficult. For example, in Levels 3 &amp; 4, you have to shoot balls that pass through a set of pipes and come out the other end, and on Level 5, you can't shoot the spaceships if they are protected by a shield, and have to wait until the shield disappears, but not for long. The game ends when you don't shoot enough targets.</resource>

On each of the five levels, Bart must collect (or get rid of) the ingredients that the Space Mutants are planning to use to build their machine, such as purple objects or balloons. He also has to collect enough &amp;quot;proof&amp;quot; of the aliens existence (brown coins left behind when they are jumped on), so his family members will help him when he meets a boss (characters such as Nelson and Sideshow Bob). This won't be easy since the Space Mutants are &amp;quot;using&amp;quot; human bodies as disguise. In order to discover who are the real Space Mutants, Bart must use his X-ray Specs.

The ways Bart can get rid of those objects sought by the Space Mutants are numerous. For instance, in the first stage, Bart must get rid of purple objects. He can dye them red, cover them, wash them, etc. Some even involve a little puzzle solving, like playing a trick on Moe to make him get out of the bar.

Bart also has some coins that can be used in many ways throughout the game, like buying things, getting devices operating, etc. Those coins are essential to solve some puzzles in the game.

Krusty the clown appears in the beginning of the game and presents a menu with five games to play (one of which is not available from the start): A jump-and-run game, where Bart must find an exit on a ship, while enemies fire at him and try to prevent him from reaching the exit; a card game, where you have five tries to find hidden cards on a board; a simple jigsaw puzzle; a series of trivia questions concerning the Simpsons; and finally, a platform-skateboard game (available only after you have completed the ship level). Needless to say all games are connected to the famous TV series &amp;quot;The Simpsons&amp;quot;.

And he's got some good and bad news. Good news is that she can be cured. Bad news is that, to prepare the medicine, he'll need five rare ingredients: bat's blood, Saci's hat, Curupira's salsaparrilha bat, Iara's hair and a tear from Cuca. To make things even worse, next night will be a full moon, and if Tia Nastácia doesn't get cured until then, she'll sleep for 100 years! So, Pedrinho (Pete) and Emília (Emily) are sent to bring the ingredients and cure Tia Nastácia.

Sítio do Picapau Amarelo (Yellow Woodpecker Ranch in English) is based on the works of Monteiro Lobato, a Brazilian writer. One or two players (in hot-seat mode) can choose to play either the boy Pedrinho (or Pete, in the English version of the books) or the rag doll Emília (Emily in the English version). The items they must gather are based on Brazilian folklore.

Gameplay consists in basic side-scrolling/platforming. Either characters can jump (button 2), run (either pressing the D-pad twice to a direction, or holding a button and the D-pad to a direction), shoot (button 1), and duck. The game has four levels (one for each ingredient, the last one with two of them), all set in the ranch, with indoor levels, underwater levels, caves and such.

Each character starts with 3 lives. They have a health bar, which can be replenished by gathering items such as nests with eggs, or by freeing birds from cages. The enemies faced are most animals, such as bats, bugs, spiders, snakes, piranhas, jaguars and monkeys.

All in game text is in Portuguese.</resource>

One of the smurfs must go out on a dangerous journey and rescue the captured smurfs. Beat the first two bosses to rescue the first two smurfs, then you can take on Gargamel. Make your way through forests, swamps, mountains, mines and more. Also ride storks, mine carts and logs to defeat Gargamel and his minions and to rescue the missing smurfs. 

On each level you must collect five stars in order to get access to the bonus level. (You don't have to collect the five stars in order to get through the main level) On the bonus level, try to collect as many bonuses as possible before the time runs out. There are three bonus levels: &amp;quot;The Dam&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;The Mushrooms&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;The Butterflies&amp;quot;.

On each level your goal is to retrieve a key which can then be used to unlock the exit. To help out, you have a magic wand which can be used to create and destroy blocks (though some blocks can't be destroyed). In order to reach the key you will need carefully to arrange the blocks on the screen so you can jump your way around safely. Wandering around each level are a variety of enemies which will cause you to lose a life if you're caught. Some creatures can be killed by destroying the block they are standing on, others must be dodged. Hidden bonuses and magic can be found on many of the levels, sometimes even hidden in blocks. Some treasures give you bonus points, others can form magic spells to help deal with the enemies. To make the game more difficult, each level has a time limit in which it must be completed.</resource>

The game was yet another addition to the series, plus Sega had hoped it would be a boost to the dying Game Gear's title selection at the time.  Brazilian based TecToy re-released the game for Sega Master System in 1997, a year after the initial release (while many may think this is a pirated title, TecToy is indeed licensed to produce and release games under the Sega name).</resource>

To stop the evil Dr. Robotnik, Sonic must traverse six zones consisting of three levels each. Most of the zones are based on the original game, but some are new. Enemies and power-ups are mostly the same as well. Sonic can pick up golden rings for protection (when hit, he simply loses all of his rings instead of a life) and bonuses: 100 rings gain Sonic an extra life, and 50 remaining rings at the end of a level allow access to pinball-themed special stages full of bumpers and springs. The final level of a zone is always a boss fight against Robotnik. Sonic should also collect the six Chaos Emeralds to keep them from falling into Robotnik's hands. In a departure from the original game, these are not hidden in the special stages but somewhere in the regular levels.</resource>

Sonic finds a letter waiting for him, that reads:

&amp;quot;Dear Sonic,

Robotnik is back, and he's captured all the animals on the island! He is holding me in a place called the Crystal Egg. In order to free me, you have to find and bring the six Chaos Emeralds.

Robotnik made me write this. He says he's waiting for you, and he's created six really nasty robots in order to 'get rid of you once and for all.' I don't know what he has planned, but Sonic, please be careful!

Sincerely, Tails.&amp;quot;

That being more that enough motivation for him, Sonic races out to defeat Robotnik again.

The master system version is totally different than the Sonic 2 for Genesis. Tails obviously doesn't accompany you, like he can in the Genesis release. Sonic can also not do his infamous buzzsaw roll by simply ducking and pressing jump.</resource>

Until now, the success of past explorations was causing the space effort to grow by leaps and bounds. Until now, the explorers had found little more than fungus and small insects as alternative
lifeforms. Until now, the chief dangers had been 
those posed by the hostile environment of space. Until now, the aliens had not known about THEM.

On the ragged edge of the galaxy, other creatures that roam the stars discover humans and spaceships to be excellent sources of food and other resources. Prepared at the worst for clashes with rival exploration teams, the human crews can do little to
defend themselves as wave upon wave of nightmare
creatures descend upon their ships and bases.

In response to their distress calls, the Federation has assembled a series of rescue teams, lead by their best military sharpshooters, to deal with the alien menace. As the leader of one of these teams, you must gun down the intruders and pick up the human survivors. Brave the maze of dark corridors that may lead to a deadly shootout between you and legions of monsters. Pick up survivors and extra ammo on the way.</resource>

The ball must be thrown into the goal at your opponent's end. Any amount of physical contact can be made, and there are no illegal ways to get the ball or the goal.

Before each match you can bribe the referee into awarding you a head-start or strengthening the abilities of your players. You compete in a simple knockout cup tournament, or in individual 2-player games.</resource>

As their manager, it is your job to transform their fortunes. As well as the league system, which consists of 2 8-team divisions and challenges you to advance to the top, there are also 2 cup tournaments, one of which is played out over 2 'legs' with the aggregate score deciding who progresses.

You can play the matches as well, which is the real meat of the game. They consist of 2 90-second periods, and the gameplay is futuristic, fast and frantic, with heavy tackling encouraged to retrieve the ball. Power-ups and tokens appear on the pitch, including ones to make your players extra-tough or freeze the opponents.

The sides of the pitch each include a score multiplier, which you can run the ball through to increase the value of your scoring - the opposition can sometimes immediately grab the ball and nullify this. There are also 5 stars which are worth 2 points each if you hit them (more if you have the multiplier activated), but these can also be cancelled out by the opposition hitting the same star, and their points values only become set after the half. Next to the stars there are 'portals' which throw the ball out the opposite side of the pitch, in the direction it was going.

You get money for the results, and by collecting the silver tokens which appear on the pitch at random intervals. Between each match you can spend these either on improving your existing players as far as they can go, or on buying better ones and fitting them into the team. Your original players can only be improved to a certain extent, so remembering where your signed players are and making use of them is important.

A variety of tokens also appear during the match, some of which boost your team's power for a short period of time, and one freezes the opposition.

It is a tale of the occult, centred around the buddhist monk Kujaku.

In this game, Kujaku is sent out by his master, Ajari, to find out what has happened at the nearby temple of Hieizan. Upon arriving, after having fought his way through magical creatures and deadly warriors, he find his comrades slain. One of them, Kubira, is still holding on to his life, and before drawing his last breath, he utters the word &amp;quot;Izumo&amp;quot;. Ajuri then sends Kujaku to the town of Izumo, where he encounters a deadly enemy of unknown origin.

Kujakuo is part adventure game à la Déjà vu (or, since this is a Sega game, Hoshi o sagashite), part platform action. To get between the adventure parts, you must pass an action level, as well as a boss fight or two, just as in Cosmic Spacehead.

The adventure part has you looking at a scenery, with a text box for descriptions and lines, and a set of verbs on the right. Use a cursor to point out specific objects for your verbs.

In the platform levels, Kujaku can jump and shoot magic bolts. While the usual bolt is small, he can load up before releasing them, R-Type style. Pressing the pause button opens up the spell menu, for accessing more powerful magical spells. New spells can be learned throughout the game. Most spells are offensive, but some grant additional powers such as levitation. Each time a spell is activated, you use up your limited spirit energy. Enemies will, when killed, sometimes drop spheres that will raise your spirit energy, though.

This game was remade into Spellcaster upon its release in the West.</resource>

But now one of the biggest criminals in the city, Wilson Fisk, a.k.a. The Kingpin, has pulled of the ultimate plot! He announces to New York that a bomb has been planted somewhere in the city, and that it'll go off in 24 hours! What's worse, he lays the blame on Spider-Man, and now the webslinger is on his own, and on the run from the police. Spidey smells a rat, and he knows what he must do.

Spidey has 24 hours to find and disarm that bomb. And he must also clear his name, so he takes his camera to take convincing photos for his Spider-Man hating boss, J. Jonah Jameson, and the police, to prove his innocence. Along the way, he just may run into a few of his *AHEM* &amp;quot;old friends&amp;quot;, including Dr. Octopus, Electro, Mysterio, and ultimately Kingpin himself!

&amp;quot;Doctor Octopus is plotting the crowning caper of his criminal career... to rule the world.
He has reunited the Sinister Six and with these super-villains together again, nothing stands in their way - except Spider-Man!&amp;quot;

Spider-Man: Return of the Sinister Six is a side-scrolling game which puts you in the role of Spidey throughout six levels against Electro, Sandman, Mysterio, Vulture, Hobgoblin and Doctor Octopus respectively. Some puzzle solving (like finding a key) is necessary to beat some levels. Spidey can duck jump, climb walls, punch, shoot webs to swing (by pressing punch and jump together) and perform a jump kick (by pressing the punch button twice). Collecting web cartridges allows Spidey to shoot limited web projectiles.

Although hard to die, Spidey has only one life, there are no items to recharge life (but killing some guys will do so) and only one continue.</resource>

Basically you get a bunch of fighters together (12 in this case) and get them to punch, kick, bite and thump the bejesus out of each other then you're close.

Here yet another slightly different version of the game turns up - this time on the Genesis. Special Champion Edition is similar in most respects to the original Street Fighter II (which never turned up on the Genesis anyway) except that all 12 characters are selectable from the get-go (the boss characters were originally locked) and the game engine has been revamped.

Gameplay is straightforward and simple. Three buttons are used, one to jump, other to attack and another to perform a range attack from a support police car. Each character has a limited set of moves that include punching and kicking or performing a back attack (if in the open), two grapple moves (depending if holding the opponent in front or by the back), a flying attack, and if playing with another player two additional tag attacks, and different abilities: Adam is slow, but a good jumper and a hard hitter, Axel fast and also a hard hitter, but a lousy jumper and Blaze fast and a good jumper, but weak hitter.
Levels are in typical arcade side-scroller fashion: move from left to right (with two exceptions), clearing screens from enemies one after another as fast as possible while avoid taking damage with a boss in the end. Some levels feature &amp;quot;death drops&amp;quot; where the player must avoid falling, while throwing enemies there at the same time, including a typical elevator level.  Several items are scattered on the ground, from melee weapons and bonus points (and lives or additional police cars) to apples and turkeys (to restore health).</resource>

One year later, after their reunion, Adam's brother Sammy returned from school to find their apartment in a mess, and Adam nowhere to be seen, and after calling his two friends, one of them notices a photo of Adam chained to a wall, next to someone they knew very well - Mr. X, who returned to turn the peaceful city once again into a war zone. Now, Axel, Blaze, Sammy, and Axel's good friend Max, a pro wrestler, must head out to stop Mr. X once again...hopefully for good...

Streets of Rage 2 differs from the previous title in several ways. There are changes in both graphics (characters now are bigger, more detailed and with more animation frames, and scenarios are less grainy) and gameplay (the rocket move was replaced by a special move that doubles in offense and defense along several new moves), along other new features such as life bars (and names) for all enemies and the radically different new characters.</resource>

Converted from the classic arcade game, Strider lets you run, jump, perform acrobatics and climb walls and overhangs. You wield a plasma sword, called a Cypher, through 5 levels fighting robots and guards, with mid- and end-level bosses.</resource>

The gameplay is similar to the original, consisting of running, jumping and attacking, with a very dynamic central character. The laser gun can be used while standing still; moving attacks with the sword are still possible, with the two weapons combining similarly to the Switchblade games. Tokens can be collected, which will turn you into a robot to face the end-of-level enemies if enough are collected.

For a breakout clone, Suho Jeonsa has an unconventional concept.

Each phase is based on a concept such as football, underwater, Egypt, etc. Of course weapons, indestructible stones and other features are also missing.

The game was first introduced with the English title Power Block, probably intended for foreign releases, as this was the title with which it ended up being included in the multi- Australian 4 Pak All Action cartridge released by HES.

It includes 40 teams (16 national and 24 club), along the ability to edit club team names and shirts and player names and looks. Game modes include friendlies, Domestic League and Cup  (composed by eight English teams), European League (16 European teams) and International cup (eight team tournament). Training allows to practice free kicks, penalties or to pass, shoot and dribble without opposition. 
Players can compete head to head, or play cooperatively against the computer in the same team. Other game options include player speed, wind and grass cut, along the typical half length, offside rules, extra time and difficulty setting. All changes, from team edits to options, are stored in the cartridge internal memory.

About the game itself, it was one of the most popular of the time, featuring a top-down view  with the ball not sticking to the players' feet being the most prominent gameplay feature.</resource>

As well as the famous Monaco course, others from around the world have been added, to give the game a longer shelf life. You must complete qualification sessions and the races as fast as possible.

The Genesis version of Super Monaco adds a complete career mode, however.  In the career mode, your goal is to win a season of races. Unfortunately, you start with a relatively slow car.  By challenging other drivers, you can move to a better team and car, and ultimately win the F1 World Title.</resource>

The world's most popular television show is Smash T.V., an ultra-violent contest between two armed-to-the-teeth combatants, set loose in a series of deadly arenas that are filled to bursting with hordes of mindless beasts and killer robots. The aim of the game is to blast everything in sight and try to grab more cash and prizes than the other guy. Toaster ovens, VCRs, fancy cars and luxury holidays are there for the taking... for anyone who can survive long enough to enjoy them.

Smash T.V. is an insane shoot-em-up from the brain of Eugene Jarvis, creator of Robotron: 2084. It retains that game's frantic style of play and two-joystick control method, but adds plenty of gore, violence, a hint of satire and that all-important two player mode.</resource>

A lot is wrong in the game: Lois Lane has been kidnapped by Brainiac, the Doom Star is orbiting the Earth and many deadly adversaries are roaming about. It's up to Superman to set everything right again.

As Superman the player has limited energy which is depleted when Superman comes in contact with enemies or their projectiles. Superman can jump, and attack. When Superman almost drops from a building he automatically starts flying. There's three different difficulty settings.

Up to two players shoot through future and present levels as robotic killers reprogrammed to serve the human resistance. 

Both players wield a machine gun with infinite ammo that lowers its firing rate (overheats) as it is continuously fired. A secondary weapon (missile launchers in the future, shotguns in the present) has limited ammo but deals heavy damage. Powerups inside the game world include secondary weapon ammo and coolant for the machine guns, and are shot to be collected.

T2: The Arcade Game features seven levels based on specific scenes or general concepts in the film. The first four levels act as a prelude, as the player guns down waves of metal Terminators across a post-apocalyptic Battlefield, a besieged Human Hideout, and through the security checkpoints of the enemy supercomputer SkyNet. After destroying the computer, players travel back in time to protect John and Sarah Connor, while also destroying every scrap of SkyNet research at the headquarters of its manufacturer. From there, players must fend off the indestructible T-1000 until the final showdown in the Steel Mill.

Assets from the movie are used when possible, such as voice clips from Arnold Schwarzenegger, and close-up digital stills of Robert Patrick for the final battle against the T-1000. The Genesis and SNES versions also support lightguns (the Menacer and Super Scope, respectively).

You are given a mission briefing before you start which gives information on the suspect and what car they drive. Then you drive across the city without crashing into other cars, and catch up with the criminal's car. To arrest the suspects, you must keep bumping into their car until it is no longer functional. And you have to do this under a strict time limit. You can't afford to crash into cars or buildings or you waste time getting on the road again. 

However, once you've caught up with your suspect, you are given more time. Your car is also equipped with turbo boosts, which you can use to gain extra speed if you are way behind the criminal. Each arrest is based on a &amp;quot;suspicion&amp;quot;.</resource>

Somewhere on Tazmania is a Lost Valley, and in that valley nests a huge seabird, so huge that one of it's eggs could feed a family for a year! Just think of the omelette one of those could make!

Thus Taz becomes fascinated and leaves in search of one of those eggs before his Dad has even finished the story...

Taz can Jump, perform a Spinning Jump and a Spin Attack. Munch roast chickens to replenish life. Gain extra points by moving quickly through the levels - there are six stages and each stage has two rounds.

There are a few other items and pickups such as:

1. Spring: boings Taz up to high ledges.
2. Blocks: destructible.
3. 1-UP: extra life.
4. Star: invulnerability. Unless you run into a bomb.
5. Bomb: does what it says on the tin.</resource>

Even though there was no World Cup held in 1993 the game Tecmo World Cup ’93 has the main teams and rules the World Cup is famous for.

Tecmo World Cup ’93 is a football game that simulates the World Cup from the Pools to the elimination rounds that end with the finals. It has the option to play the 24 most known countries to have played in the World Cup, each with players having there own skill levels based on the real teams. There are 3 more modes to chose from that includes Versus where the player can play against a friend, Exhibition where one the player picks a opponent to play a single match, and Watch where the player picks two CPU players to battle it out alone.

When playing a game the player first picks the team they want to play (and there opponents team if in Exhibition mode) and the color of there jersey before the CPU picks a random jersey color for their team. Before the match starts the player can set up the formation of the team and can also set up who plays and their position, this menu can also be accessed when a goal is scored or the ball goes out. The players (that are all abbreviated to there initials) have stats for Power, Speed, and Technique. When the game starts the player is presented with a side on birds’ eye view of the field. The player, when in control of the ball can pass the ball to the closest team mate or attempt for a goal. When defending the player can change the controlling player or do a slide tackle (slide tackle is the only tackle the player can do). There is no penalties in the game other then kicking the ball out. The game is fast paced as it is played in sped up mode to get a full game in a reduced time. There are 3 levels of difficulty and the default game length can be changed in the configuration. Password save after each match is available.</resource>

However, the game's six levels mirror the story-line of The Terminator movie very closely as you take on the role of Kyle Reese and his quest to save Sarah Connor from termination.

Because the game follows the movie so closely, the first mission which involves blowing up the SkyNet computer and escaping through time is one of the hardest and something that most players remember with love/hate.</resource>

The game features 12 levels split into three distinct styles. First of all you'll be flying over a city in your helicopter, shooting out tanks by ducking low enough to target them, but also climbing to avoid the skyscrapers in the area. The third section is viewed similarly, but sees you attempting to wipe out the planes mounted on an aircraft carrier.

The second section is viewed behind your helicopter in full 3D, and adds helicopters and planes to be shot, with dodging their bullets as you duck down to shoot the tanks being the main challenge.

The player plays as Tom, a curious cat who will do anything to get his paws on that trouble-maker mouse, Jerry. Tom tries to catch Jerry as he runs through six different levels. Starting in the Kitchen, Jerry will lead Tom through the Garden, Down Town, the Forest, Rock Mountain, and finally ending up in the Nursery.

Jerry will do anything he can to keep Tom from snagging him. Even if that means running through dangerous areas. Tom must try and dodge tail-scorching stoves, dropping flower pots, falling boulders, and even climb skyscrapers and swim underwater all while trying to nab that rascally rodent. Not only that, Jerry will also throw bombs and leave land mines in Tom's path.

Be careful, if Jerry gets too far ahead and out of site, the game is lost. But, if Tom is able to get close enough, he can pounce on Jerry resulting in an advance the next level. The next level can also be reached to by chasing Jerry to the end of the round where he will be cornered. There are also damage points that are taken away from Tom as he is hit by the number of dangerous environments around him. Too many hits will also result in a game over. It is just another hard days work for Tom the cat!

But something is still wrong. DALAUS, a leftover computer from the old world is creating its own empire, and it is up to you to stop it. To complete this mission you will pilot a CA-214 (the TransBot), a new experimental astro-plane. TransBot is a side scrolling shooter for one or two players. There are a wide variety of enemies you will need to get past to be victorious throughout the many locations. The CA-214 can have different types of weapons to help out. You start out with a basic, default gun, but after collection a ? symbol you can choose a new weapon to use. There are six choices which will scroll past at the top of the screen, and your TransBot will be powered with whatever selection you make. Powered up weapons will only last for a limited amount of time before the TransBot reverts back to the basic weapon.</resource>

The game involves answering questions on one of six subject categories to gain moves, and answering questions on special squares to gain one of the six 'Wedges' you need to gain the right to take on the final winning question. Questions are aimed at British players - many entertainment questions are based on British TV, and sport questions relate to popular British sports.

Two game modes are available:- single player (which involves answering questions against the clock) and multiplayer (where you can take on up to five human-controlled players). The computer reveals the answer, and you select 'yes' or 'no' to tell it whether you got it right.

The question categories are exactly the same as the board game, however two different question styles are added to take advantage of computer technology - some questions relate to a picture or diagram and some relate to a piece of music. 

One additional feature not available in the board game is a statistical analysis of the number and type of questions answered correctly. This can be split into the performances of all the players, or the performance of an individual player within the six categories. It is especially useful at the end of the game, when choosing which category a player must answer to win the game.</resource>

    <resource id="9d486141734ae0739b8640847b018a9062ff97fc" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">The fourth game in the now well-established Ultima series featured an improved game engine, with color graphics and better character interaction (you could now have actual conversations with NPCs). But what really makes Ultima IV shine is its radical departure from any other RPG made before or since in terms of the story and goal. 

Instead of building up your character by any means possible in order to face the Ultimate Evil in a big bang up showdown, in Ultima IV you were trying to become the Avatar, a role model of sorts for the people of the land. This meant upholding the &amp;quot;eight virtues&amp;quot; and basically trying to become a better person. In most RPGs you chose to be a just/nice hero because the people you'd help would usually provide you with some nice equipment for your services, but in Ultima IV you helped people not for a reward or to advance the plot but simply because it was the &amp;quot;right thing to do&amp;quot;. The game actually frowns on behavior that was typical of most other RPGs, such as backstabbing fleeing monsters or picking up everything that wasn't nailed down even if it didn't belong to you. The game keeps track of all your actions, so if you went about killing and looting like in most RPGs, you'd never finish the game.

This VERY different approach to the game's ultimate goal is what makes Ultima IV famous so many years later, and became the sort of design philosophy that made all the following Ultimas so unique in their genre. 

Of course, the game still has plenty of traditional RPG elements such as dungeons to explore and hostile monsters to kill, as well as a typical final &amp;quot;Holy Grail&amp;quot; type quest where you had to find the Codex of Ultimate Wisdom to complete your transformation into Avatarhood.

    <resource id="b1ffa02078fc290d296d5a0d3bf77bae693eb7c8" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Ultimate Soccer is a football (European) game composed by 64 (unlicensed) international teams, each with it's own values for running, ball control and strength. There are five game modes (friendly, penalty shootout, tournament, playoff and league), but the lack of password or built-in battery means each one of them must be completed in one sitting.

The gameplay can be tweaked for the players' preference by changing several key aspects of the physics engine, such as wind strength and direction, ball weight (lighter balls travel higher, faster  and farther but are more prone to be deflected by winds than heavy balls, who barely lift of the ground and are slowed down by wet grass), tightness of ball control and players speed and momentum. A five-a-side mode, where the ball is never out of play is also included. Thanks to the many options regarding the physics, the game allows a lot of flexibility in playmaking, from building up the play with small passes from the midfield to belting the ball upwards in hope of a goalmouth deflection.

Graphically, the game is similar to EA's Madden NFL series, with pseudo-3D effects allowing the view to be tilted up to show more detail up front or tilted down to show more of the field. 

The series later continued with Striker on the same console and Striker' 96 on PC, Saturn and PlayStation.</resource>

    <resource id="d653cf83fb6811433af9380c7c5af8e8b66e8e55" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Virtua Fighter Animation is an one-on-one 2D fighting game based on the Virtua Fighter anime series. It has two game modes: story and versus.

In the story mode, the player follows the anime's plot, with anime style cutscenes before and after each fight. The story is divided in acts, each one of them corresponding to one fight. The player starts controlling Akira Yuki, as as he beats his opponents, each one of them joins his party, so they can be chosen in the next fights. Besides Akira, the other characters which become available are Pai Chan, Jacky Bryant, Wolf Hawkfield, Kage-Maru, Sarah Bryant and Lau Chan. In the final act, the player must fight against Dural.

The versus mode allows players to choose any of the seven available characters to fight against the CPU. In the two player versus game, Kage-Maru is removed from the character selection.

The Game Gear version has 3 different viewing modes: Normal, Large and Real-Time. The Normal viewing mode shows the fighters from a more distant position (smaller sprites) than the Large mode (larger sprites). The Real-Time mode simulates the zooming camera effects from the other Virtua Fighter games, alternating between the Normal and Large modes. It also has an extended intro sequence, with anime style cutscenes.

In regards to gameplay, the game doesn't differ much from any other 2D fighting game, as the player can perform punches (button 1), kicks (button 2) and jumps (up), as well as some special maneuvers. The Game Gear version has also a block function (START button), absent in the Master System version. The fights are regular best of 3 round matches, and players will loose a round if one of this three possibilities happen: their energy is depleted, they fall out of the ring or they have less energy than the opponent if the time runs out.</resource>

This organization specializes in stealing the world's treasures without a trace. Alarmed by this, the A.C.M.E. Detective Agency makes it their personal mission to foil Carmen Sandiego's plans.

Carmen Sandiego is an game that tests the player's knowledge about geography and general knowledge about different countries. Missions will begin with a treasure being stolen and the player flying to that location. A time limit counts down while they must search the area and interview witnesses to find enough clues to figure out what country the thief flew to next. The player always has a limited selection (usually three or four) of flights available in any given country. This process is repeated until either the villain is found or time expires and they are able to get away. Along with finding out where the thief has headed, the player must discover who the thief is, by best matching personal characteristics (gender, hair color, eye color, hobbies, notable features) to dossiers on Carmen's gang. There must be enough characteristics matched in order to obtain a warrant, which is essential to legally arrest the suspect once they have been found. Progress in arresting VILE members will expose other members, eventually leading up to Carmen Sandiego herself.

That's why he has to explore deep dark forests, cross endless oceans, climb treacherous slopes, survive endless volcanoes, and even walk through clouds. But Tom-Tom will never be totally alone. You see, when he goes through the exotic locations, he has to come face to face with its inhabitants, like bees, spiders, snakes, coal-kids, frogs, bats, snails, coyotes, and octopuses, to name a few. The hatchet is Tom-Tom's only line of defense against these menaces.

There are ten areas, each containing four rounds each, but the tenth area can't be accessed unless Tom-Tom collects all the dolls during his rescue mission. During his journey, he can break open different eggs that will reveal hatchets, skateboards, mushrooms, milk, and even guardian angels. You can ride the skateboard through each round, as long as you don't collide with an inhabitant. When you complete each round while still riding the skateboard, you'll start the next round still riding it. As you progress through each round, your vitality will start to get low, but it can be increased by getting milk, mushrooms, potato chips,or fruit that appear everywhere you go. As well as the normal eggs, there are also speckled eggs that must be avoided, otherwise the God of Death will be released, and once he follows you, you'll lose vitality much quickly. At the end of every fourth round, there is a king waiting to destroy you with his fireballs or lightning bolts.

There are also warp-gates, but you don't find them, they find you. You see, warp-gates appear in rounds 1-4 of each area. If you happen to get one fruit, a special item will appear. These special items include handbags, wrist watches, a pair of shoes, a teddy bear, and a bottle of perfume. Another girl will appear and take you up to the clouds where the object is to collect as many hearts as you can without falling down or getting the item again. Once you have collected all the hearts, you can get the item to return to the surface, and more often than not, you'll get further in the round.</resource>

When Tom-Tom defeats the MEKA dragon, the wounded beast casts a spell on him, turning him into a Lizard-Man. To regain your original human form, you have to find the Salamander Cross, hidden by the Vampire Dragon in Monster Land.

In this side-scrolling platform game, you can still buy equipment and items, but unlike its predecessor, it is not divided in sequences of levels. You are allowed to go anywhere, as long as you have the right shape or equipment. During his quest, Tom-Tom has to defeat various dragon bosses. Each win will give you a new shape with new abilities such as flying, swimming, walking on ceilings or clinging to walls, which also give you to access new parts of the world. The possible shapes are Lizard-Man, Mouse-Man, Piranha-Man, Lion-Man and Hawk-Man and the main abilities are defined by attacking power, defense points and charm points (needed for equipment by collecting charm stones). Also, certain blocks can only be destroyed by specific weapons or are only accessible to certain shapes.

The basic actions consist of attacking and jumping, and in the status screen you can equip swords, shields and armour. Special attacks include fire balls, tornadoes, arrows, boomerangs and thunder strikes. Along the way, you collect keys (only one at all times) and gold left behind by defeated creatures, and you often have to revisit places to access new areas. A password is given at the beginning of each town to continue from there.

Word of Tom-Tom's dangerous adventure soon spread throughout Wonder Land. The people were very proud of him and gave Tom-Tom the highest honor of all - the legendary name of Wonder Boy. With the evil King defeated, Wonder Land returned to its peaceful state, and for over one decade, the kingdom was a paradise, and everything and everyone lived happily together.
Eventually, the peace was broken when a ferocious fire-breathing dragon appeared out of nowhere and took over Wonder Land with an army of evil, monsterous henchmen, causing Wonder Land was immediately thrown into utter chaos. The people were quickly taken over and the tranquil and serene kingdom was transformed into a land of demons and devils. Wonder Land was now a Monster Land.

Then, the peace was shattered by an invading army of monsters. A young man named Shion vowed to defeat them and make his land peaceful again.&amp;quot;

Wonder Boy In Monster World puts you in control of Shion in his quest to save Monster World from the evil hands of BioMeka.  It controls like your standard platform game - run, jump, and kill enemies.  The game is filled with RPG elements such as talking to townsfolk, collecting money to buy items, upgrading your life, and equipping a variety of armor and weapons - staying very close to the &amp;quot;Zelda format&amp;quot;.  You can save your game to continue your quest at a later time.

Wonder Boy In Monster World is the third game in the Monster World spin-off series.  In Japan the game is called Wonder Boy 5: Monster World 3.</resource>

Typically, the scrolling is choppy here, too. There have been several other small compromises, but overall Wonsiin is a decent port of the Knightmare inspired game. Especially some elements that one would think would have been sacrificed on the MSX, most impressively the attacking dinosaur skeletons, are intact. Still, Wonsiin ends after three stages, leaving out the final challenges.</resource>

Sega's answer was called Woody Pop.

With a wooden paddle, which in fact is Woody the tree spirit, you bounce your ball against bricks laid out in a big house filled with toys. The toys will come out to disturb you. When you hit &amp;quot;mystery bricks&amp;quot;, wind-up toy soldiers or robots come out, obstructing your ball. On some levels, a toy train will cross your path as well. Speaking of wells, the bottom of the screen is not a big black hole as in most other games of this kind – instead the whole covers only a part of the wall, so that even if you miss the ball, it might bounce back in the corners.

Once a room is cleared, you can choose freely between up to three adjacent rooms to progress to, making this game less linear than usual.

Like any post-Arkanoid game, there is a range of powerups released from special blocks. Most are known from other games such as the double-ball, the growing bat or the &amp;quot;diamond ball&amp;quot;, which destroys all blocks in its path without ricocheting. Some invented by Sega are the fire ball, which sets blocks on fire, allowing them to destroy even neighbouring blocks, and the big ball, which hits bricks with more power, thereby destroying brick with one hit that would otherwise have required several.</resource>

He has imprisoned some X-Men from the past to recreate their greatest battles. Wolverine and Rogue have to enter the game and rescue their friends, then defeating Mojo to return back home. 

In this platform game, the player starts choosing either Wolverine or Rogue. At each new level beaten, a new X-Men will be available: first Gambit, then Cyclops, Havoc and finally Shard. If one of the X-Men dies, the player has to start the level again, choosing among the remaining X-Men the one to play. After all the X-Men have died, the game is over.

Each character can activate his/her power at will. Wolverine can use his claws, Rogue can fly, Gambit can throw explosive cards, Cyclops will fire optic blasts, Havoc fires plasma blasts and Shard fires energy blasts. The characters have an energy meter and a power meter, which will worn out as they are hit or use their powers, respectively. They can find items to restore their energy and power.

Gameplay consists basically in finding the way out of each of the six levels. Once finding it, the character will face a boss, usually known characters from the comics like Magneto, Fitzroy, a Sentinel, etc. The last boss is Mojo himself.</resource>

Each group of enemies you destroy grants you a cash reward and every once in a while you enter Colin's Bargain Basement, where you can use this cash to purchase upgrades for your ship like better weapons, speed &amp; health upgrades etc. Some upgrades can also be picked up during the levels.

The first part of the game has an organic feel to it, while the second part of the game features mechanical enemies. As there are some maze-like sections with dead-ends in the game, your spaceship  scrolls backwards when you keep pressing the down key.

A typical Bitmap Brothers smash, the game is also famous for its soundtrack by British electronica group Bomb The Bass.

Each area contains one or more blinking red dots. Your goal is to roll the ball over the blinking points and, if you do, the spot will stop blinking. You will enter the next phase when all the points have been rolled. But beware, you are chased by star-shaped objects and if they touch you it's Game Over.</resource>

But the Goddesses of Y's saved the Kingdom from ruin. Their feats were written in six magical books and hidden until the time the Goddesses would be needed again. A thousand years later, that time has come. You are Aron, a wanderer. An evil sorcerer named Dark Dekt is planning diabolical magic. And the Seer Sara is desperately looking for a swordsman to help her find the vanished six books of Y's. Now arm yourself and prepare for an adventure into the unknown. Where caverns and towers are filled with creatures and hoards of treasure. Where the strangest people have clues to tell you. Where your skill in combat depends on your reflexes. If you succeed, you'll have the power to call down the Goddesses. Fail, and Dark Dekt will rule the Kingdom under a reign of terror forever!</resource>
