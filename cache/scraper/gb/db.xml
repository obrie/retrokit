The player has to guide a small potato to the exit of each level, which is made difficult by a number of obstacles. Crates have to be pushed out of the way or into holes to make them traversable. Difficulty is increased by the fact that there are crates and holes of several different shapes and sizes and many levels contain different types of spinning doors.

The game features four different modes of play: Beginners Mode in which the basics are explained and the player receives hints on how to solve each level; Practice Mode that lets the player choose the size of the levels which are then randomly picked; Puzzle Mode in which the player has to complete 40 levels and receives a score depending on the time it took him to complete a level; and finally Action Mode, which is basically a story mode containing two stories. The game also features a password system and four different difficulty levels.</resource>

As in the real sport, the goal is to knock the opponent out of the ring. However, it is not a particularly realistic interpretation of sumo, playing much like a traditional 1-vs-1 fighting game. There are grabs, throws, and special moves, and the player can also win by knockout by draining the opponent's stamina. There is a single-player mode that follows the story of protagonist Harimanada, as well as a versus mode for one or two players where any of 15 characters can be used.</resource>

The player takes the role of Gomez who searches for his missing family members. To find them he has to explore six different parts of the mansion, e.g. the forest or the graveyard, which are basic platform levels: the player moves from left to right while jumping a lot and avoiding enemies. In contrast to the other versions of the game he has weapons to his disposal, e.g. a throwing knife. Other differences are a unique level design and another health system: Gomez has five hearts which practically act like a life meter because every hit only takes away a part of a heart.</resource>

The entire Addams family is being held captive by various monsters throughout the mansion, and Pugsley needs to rescue them. They are hidden in various parts of the mansion, e.g. the forest, which can be accessed in any order. The gameplay follows the usual platforming standards: Pugsley moves from left to right while jumping a lot and avoiding enemies.

This version of the game is heavily based on the SNES version of The Addams Family - it features the same storyline with another main character and almost identical level design. Another difference to the SNES version of this game is that Pugsley can only take two hits before dying - but there is an additional power-up that makes him faster and gives him an extra hit.

That is until the Evil Witch Doctor decides to capture Tina and hold her as his own. It's up to Master Higgins to gather throwing axes, fireballs and skateboards in order to aid his noble quest.

The game is a side scroller, Master Higgins moves across the screen from left to right and finds his power-ups in giant eggs. This includes a skateboard which results in a great speed enhancement - until Master Higgins gets hit and loses his power. If he is not on a skateboard a hit means instant death. Another game mechanic is starvation which gets indicated through a meter which steadily decreases. If it hits zero the hero dies and the only way to fill it up is by collecting food on the way. Bosses await him at the end of levels, all the way to the Evil Witch Doctor himself.</resource>

Separated from his sister, Tony is left stranded in the middle of nowhere, but luckily for him the aliens left something for him, having stolen a mech from elsewhere in the galaxy. Powerful and deadly, the mech seems to have a mind of its own, and agrees to join Tony on the quest to find his sister.

The side-scrolling shooter pits you against a host of different alien creatures across the galaxy. You'll start inside the mech itself, collecting weapon upgrades along the way to increase your chances of defeating the alien scum. But be careful, if you're hit by them, you'll lose the safety of the mech and be all by yourself.</resource>

But before this can happen, a series of obstacles have to be cleared, e.g. wandering robots, platforming challenges or small puzzles (when not destroyable blocks are placed directly above destroyable ones, they fall down when their support is gone). Besides walking and jumping, the robot also has a gun to his disposal. The angle can be changed and by holding the fire button longer, the flying distance of the shot can be set. Each level has a time limit and sometimes there is a boss to defeat. Additionally there is a duel mode, also in levels shown from the side, in which two opponents (the second either controlled by a human or the AI) try to kill each other.</resource>

Alfred cannot fly, but he can use ramps to jump up and hit enemies with his bionic beak - this kills them, but any other contact will hurt Alfred. Watch out for spiked snails though. Other enemies include whales armed with guns, and stray bombs.</resource>

The aliens soon hatch and wipe out the human population. However, when the predators move in for the hunt, they find they are vastly outnumbered and suffer the same fate. Only one of them survives. He theorizes that among the hatched aliens there was a queen that laid additional eggs, which would explain the huge number of aliens. The last survivor sets out to destroy the queen and regain the honor of his clan. The predator must traverse several side-scrolling levels on his way to the queen, while destroying aliens in all their forms - facehuggers hatched from eggs, chestburster aliens and fully grown warriors.</resource>

As Mario, the player must control a &amp;quot;podship&amp;quot; and deflect the ball towards the mass of blocks. Hitting a block will either weaken or destroy it.

The game uses a small number of repeating tables along with twists such as horizontal rotation, periodical vertical drop of the entire mass of blocks, etc.

On those lines are switches (represented by a minus) and dots which need to be activated respectively kicked. If all lines around a square are cleared, it gets filled out and all enemies which happen to stand on one of the lines are killed (but respawn shortly after). The goal of the level is to fill all squares out. A life is lost by touching an enemy or running out of time.</resource>

After prolonged battles, both sides came to an agreement and established peace. But now, things start changing. A demon cult is becoming popular, and demons no longer wish to live in peace with the humans. Only you, the Hero of the game (nameless), aided by the Heroine (also nameless) and other friends, is able to bring peace back to the planet.

The Heroine has a special ability: she can talk to the demons you meet in random battles and persuade them to join your party. You can store those demons, collect them, and summon them in battles. Demons are divided into various races and species. Otherwise, the game uses a standard turn-based combat with physical attacks and magic spells.

The game is a part of Megaten universe, but unlike most other Megaten games (with the exception of  Last Bible series), it is set in a medieval world.</resource>

    <resource id="acaa2a6d4ce2ba4d6ca052e2627089e21d85a7b8" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">In a far away land, war was raging, as an evil ruler sent his troops to invade the castle of a mighty king. His minions stormed the castle and burnt it down. The king could not escape his fate, and the villain thought no one was spared by his wrath...

Present time. You are Ariel, a little girl who lives with her old wise grandmother in a small house near a mountain range, north to the forest. She just turned ten, and the grandmother sends her on a seemingly simple quest: to go through the forest to Nineveh, the nearby town, and to meet there a certain person. But what starts as a simple assignment soon develops into the quest for magic powers of Aretha, the ultimate battle against the evil, and the discovery of Ariel's own true identity.

The game is a console-style RPG, where Ariel and her party travel on the world map, through forests, mountain paths, and caves, occasionally visiting towns and fighting monsters in turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective, using a variety of physical and special attacks.</resource>

Asmik-kun World), this game was never released outside Japan. Like its predecessor, the game is an excellent example of the trap-em-up genre, which also includes games like Heiankyo Alien and Space Panic.

In the game, Asmik-kun has to build a &amp;quot;road&amp;quot; from the entrance to the exit in each level. An enemy has come to kidnap the children on a certain world and the &amp;quot;roads&amp;quot; are intended for the children to be rescued and escorted safely back home.</resource>

To show Caesar the power and freedom of your village, you have to collect various trophies from all over Europe. To do this, you can select Asterix or Obelix and move them through various levels while beating up Roman soldiers, collecting coins and avoiding gaps or other obstacles. Various special levels like crossing the sea to Great Britain by boat (and beating up some Romans again) or freeing Rugby players captured by the Romans are scattered across the game and provide variety between the classical Jump 'n Run levels. Most levels additionally have a time limit to make things a bit harder, though the difficulty of the game can be adjusted.

There's an overall of four different countries, all of them based on comic books of the series (namely: Asterix in Britain, Asterix in Switzerland, Asterix at the Olympic Games, Asterix in Spain). At the end of each of these stages you have to contend in a contest typical for the country and also taken from the plot of the comics: In Britannia you take part in a rugby match, in Switzerland you have to blast safes, in Greece you take part in the Olympic games and in Spain you have to fight against (or run from) a bull - victory will get you the desired trophy!</resource>

Take the original, Atari coin-op game Asteroids, add in the features of the Atari 2600 cartridge, then give it 3-D graphics and a bunch of power-ups, and you've got Activision's Asteroids remake.

You are an employee of the Astro-Mining Corporation.  Your mission is to simply go to an assigned area of space and clear the area of asteroids and the occassional debris.  The game consists of five zones, each with a different background and some with special features.  Each zone has 15 levels.  In addition to the standard asteroids, there are also mined asteroids that explode; indestructible asteroids that are, well, indestructible; fireball comets; crystal asteroids that regenerate; alien egg asteroids containing deadly baby space worms; and ancient energy asteroids that shoot back!  And there's plenty of enemies in addition to the asteroids, such as Standard and Super Saucers, Asteroids Tugs, Fuel Transports, Hexes, Nuke Drivers, and Vulturoids.

There are three types of ships to choose from, each with different strengths and weaknesses.  There are also three skill levels.  If you beat the game at Expert or higher, you gain access to a fourth type of ship.  All ships features the standard laser, shield, flip (instantly flips your ship 180 degrees), and hyperspace.  There are also limited power-ups you can  pick up such as GunSat, Mines, Homing Missiles, Plasma Drill, and Trigger Bombs.

The game supports either one or two players.  In two player mode, the object is to simply outscore your opponent in a random zone and level.  You cannot directly kill your opponent by shooting him, but there are other ways....

Lastly, if you shoot the classic-style asteroid in level 15 of the first zone, you'll find the option of &amp;quot;Classic Asteroids&amp;quot; now appearing on the main menu.</resource>

Unfortunately there are only so much usable platforms available, in the space levels even less, which have to hit by performing controlled jumps. The platforms come in three heights which are indicated by their size - the bigger, the higher. Landing on a platform creates a lot of force and either causes the block to crack and, if it has a question mark on it, gives a power up (extra time or points). 

The levels loop until the player finds a heart hidden in the question mark blocks - but landing on a cracked platform causes it to give way. Of course there are also enemies which have to be avoided or shot with the gun. Those leave behind power ups which give additional ammo or improve the jumping height respectively speed.</resource>

Gangreen from unleashing his Doomsday Tomato. With all the citizens of San Zucchini terrified of the fanged vegetables coming from the sewers, Chad will be on his own to take on the tomato scourge. The doctor doesn't take him lightly, however, and has sent his special tomato squad, Zoltan, Beefstake, Mummato, Fang, Ketchuck and Tomacho, to stop him.

The game is a side-scrolling platform jumping game where the main method of stopping the killer tomatoes is to jump on them. From that they'll either splatter, run away or transform into smaller tomato bits. Energy Power-ups exist to refill Chad's health.</resource>

The player is able to possess enemies, 20 in all, and use any skills or weapons they have, to complete the level.

You control a little girl who's brother has floated away on a big bunch of balloons. It's up to you to chase after him through 8 treacherous levels.  Instead of the usual jumping from platform to platform, you have a pair of balloons that allow you to float through the level. You must control your height carefully by tapping the 'A' button. Meanwhile, the screen is always scrolling to the left, and you have to keep up.

In addition to the single player adventure, there is a 2-player mode that allows you to compete against a friend via the Game Boy link cable.  In this mode you try to get your opponent to maneuver their balloon kid into the various level hazards.</resource>

It was released in Japan on July 26, 1991. Banishing Racer was also sold around Hong Kong. The game allows the player to take control of an animated car against numerous enemies that must be jumped on to defeat, in a fashion similar to Super Mario Land. The player has three lives before being allowed to continue or start over. One hit kills the player and forces a restart from the beginning of the level. The car model used within the game looks very similar to a Subaru 360.</resource>

Barbie travels through various location in the mall, at the beach and in the soda shop trying to make it from the left side of each level to the right.  Each level is populated with animals and with living objects of the sort you would find in that location.  She can jump with the A button and throw crystals with the B button.  The longer you hold the button down, the farther each crystal is thrown.  She has three kinds of crystals, each of which has a different effect.  One makes creatures help her, one defeats them and one has varying effects.</resource>

Experience the action as pitchers battle it out against a lineup of heavy hitters using fast, slow, curving and special pitches.  Each player brings their own unique stats and abilities to the game as you work your way through progressively more challenging teams.

This portable version of Bases Loaded is loosely based on the title for the original NES.  In this scaled down version Major League teams are replaced with two teams representing the East and West Coast Divisions. With two Game Boy units and a Video Link cable players can go head to head - although each player will also need their own game cartridge. Single players can enjoy a quick pickup game by selecting an unofficial game of 1 to 9 innings. An official game will allow a victorious team to move on to consecutive matches against progressively more challenging teams, a feature that substitutes for the traditional 'Season Mode' of most baseball titles. But you'll have to do this in a single sitting as no battery save option was included.

Play in USA or Japan mode for a subtle change in the gameplay or learn how to best utilize the strengths of the East and West teams. Pitchers are rated 1 to 5 and batters get a rating for both running speed and hitting ability.</resource>

From the dark streets of GOTHAM CITY to the deepest corners of the criminal underground comes the CAPED CRUSADER as you've never seen him before.

Incredibly strong. Armed to the teeth. And ready to put his life on the line for the sake of all, on a search-and-destroy mission to end THE JOKER'S reign of terror. He leaps, he flies, he dodges enemy fire and delivers it right back ... with a vengeance.

This is no kid stuff. This is as real as video gaming gets. If you liked what you saw in the movie, you're gonna love what you see here. Because this time around, BATMAN is all business, and he won't let anything ... anything ... stand in his way.</resource>

This game is a hybrid of side-scrolling platformer and one-on-one fighter. The player makes way through levels that include some platform jumping elements, but take on opponents one at a time like in a fighting game. The player's arsenal includes a lot of nifty bat-gadgets (one has to be chosen before the level starts) and a collection of fighting moves that are unleashed with special button combinations. In contrast to the console/DOS version, there are no puzzles to solve.</resource>

    <resource id="b8d833ca3d4ecb3c56ea0f3644ae1dca76fa3fdf" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">In Battle Arena Toshinden eight world renown weapon fighters have been invited to a mysterious tournament. It is one of the first one-on-one beat-em-ups to feature the ability to sidestep a full 360 degrees around the opponent allowing one to strike from any angle. Aside from the 3D movement, Toshinden's game play can be considered similar to Street Fighter, but in 3d and with a little less depth to the moves.

Two versions of Toshinden were released; for the Sony PlayStation and later a lesser known version for DOS PC's. However the PC version is not a straight port of the PlayStation version and plays and looks notably different despite sharing the same characters, attacks and controls.

The U.S and E.U PlayStation versions of Toshinden feature redone voices in English and redone music using different instruments. 

The lyrics on Sofia's stage music in the Japanese version, which were actually in English, were removed in the process, likely due to their suggestive nature. 

Sofia's and Ellis' voices in the English translation are also notably adjusted, for presumably the same reason; while the other characters English voices generally match the tones of the original Japanese voice actors, Sofia is far less suggestive sounding, while Ellis sounds notably older.

The later DOS version of Toshinden however, uses the same audio as the Japanese PlayStation version in all regions, albeit recorded at a considerably lower quality than they were on PlayStation.</resource>

The goal is simple: driving through the levels and killing a certain amount of other (respawning) drivers. The usual way of achieving this is shoving stones into them. However, only a certain kind of stone can be used this way; the other ones are permanent. The other vehicles have the same ability in addition to the deadly touch.

After each round, the player receives money which can be reinvested inside the upgrade shop. The available items are better engines, better shovels, extra lives, the ability to jump and weapons. The latter are obviously an alternate way of reaching the kill ratio.</resource>

The general gist of the game is that you can choose one of the six teams. You then fight each of the other five teams once per round in a short dodgeball game, two-on-two. Unlike normal dodgeball, you are not knocked out with a single hit. Rather, in Battle Dodge Ball, each character has a specific amount of HP. Once he takes enough hits to lose all his HP, he is out of the match.

Along with HP, this trends into a general statistics system with several other stats. If you win a match, you gain a variable amount of experience points, and 15 experience points if you lose a match. You can level up your stats and make each match significantly easier over time.

Your team has two players each. The Leader has the ability to make special attacks, and is generally more powerful. The follower, however, has two 'forms' or copies or whatever - an infielder who plays on the main arena, and an outfielder who stands on the lines behind the enemy side of the arena and can catch long passes and grab balls that enemies dodge. The outfielder can also return balls to you, but also throw it at the enemy players, making him potentially dangerous. Stats for the outfielder are upgraded separately from his infield counterpart.

Once you play a full 10 rounds against each of the five opposing teams, the game ends.</resource>

    <resource id="a199f46100b5722eab6377b45ebe592a3f9c2c57" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Battle of Kingdom is a Japan-exclusive strategy/board game. 
The object is to lead a kingdom through various battles using the format of a traditional board game. 
In order to advance to the next battle, players must destroy at least 92% of the monsters on the battlefield. 
Each stage represents a battle in a high fantasy campaign to save the world from an unknown evil force (that resides in a skull castle). As players progresses to the right side of the screen killing monsters from the enemy forces, the probability of winning the entire battle shows up in percentage. Players are unable to automatically attack the opponent if the number of points on the attack power meter becomes depleted. Attacking manually does not deduct attack points from the player's statistics, however.
Monsters like slimes can face off against each other for control of the playing field in the lower levels of the game, 
while players are allowed in the upper levels of the game to summon the King's loyal army of archers, knights, horsemen and magicians. Even the leader of each respective kingdom is expected to fight. All these creatures must be bought in card form before being allowed to join the battlefield. The player's creatures can either fight, run away from battle, or cast a magic spell. All creatures have hit points, attack points, and special points.

    <resource id="1112fa93285b654634dcdafe74794c968f460354" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">This game is much like Zelda II: The Adventure of Link turned into ancient Greece. You play as Orpheus, whose girlfriend, Helene, has been kidnapped by the demonic ruler of the netherworld called Hades. So begins the journey.

Just like in Zelda II, there is a top-down map of Greece with towns and other locations to explore. Each of these has side-scrolling sections in which Orpheus fights his way through the minions of Hades. There are various items one must get to continue to the next location, including swords, shields and crystals. There are three fragments of love hidden around; Orpheus has to find them before he can enter Tartarus and fight Hades to save his beloved Helene.

The monsters of the game are also based on the Greek mythology and it is pretty entertaining to confront cyclopes, minotaurs and pegasuses.</resource>

Destroy different enemy tanks, while trying to keep them away from your base. When you have destroyed 20 enemy tanks you advance to the next level with different layout. In each level there's some obstacles which you can use to your advantage. Obstacles include red bricks which you can shoot out of your way, silver bricks which are highly armored, water and ice. You start the game with a basic tank, which you can power up to better one little by little. 

The NES game includes a construction mode, so you can make your own levels when you have played through all the 35 original levels.</resource>

Two players have a grid of boxes. You use your mouse to decide where your ships should go, and compete to try to find and sink your opponents ships.

There is a win record menu that tells how many time you won and lost or drew. Options include whether the game has a 10 x 10 or 15 x 15 board, and allow you to choose between a single shot or salvo shooting, and whether you can use Cluster bombs, Cruise missiles and Smart Bombs, and you can use Ship resources or Fleet resources. There are Beginner, Intermediate or Expert skill levels,  and you can decide who goes first, with the option of this being decided randomly.</resource>

You will control a battletoad through 13 levels (five of which are missing from the Game Boy port). Some are side-scrolling beat-em-ups, other are vertical drops down a shaft, fighting as you go, others have you riding a rocket or surfboard, shooting or avoiding enemies. At the end of each area, there is a boss. In some areas, about half-way through, you may have a mini-boss.</resource>

Explore all the puppies' favorite hangouts the Neighborhood, the Park, Downtown, the Supermarket, and more in this dog-gone mystery adventure.

Your four puppies need to be rescued and brought back to their mom. As a responsible father and guardian you'll first need to find the puppy, avoiding dangers such as bad-tempered cats, mean dogcatchers, acorns which have a habit to drop down just when you pass underneath, and careless skateboarders. You can bark at these opponents to scare them away. And if you'll find a source of water (such as a rubber hose), you can make yourself wet and then - in a tense situation - shake off the water, eliminating everyone in the vicinity. 

Once you find your pup, you'll find out that getting him back to his mom is no easy task. While your puppy can - thankfully - walk on his own accord when you put him down, you'll still have to carry it over obstacles, and you'll be forced to fight all the enemies again while doing it.</resource>

In this game, the player controlled Usagi Tsukino/Sailor Moon. The storyline was based on the first, third, and fourth episodes of the first season of the anime. Although they originally had not yet appeared in those episodes, in the game Usagi could meet and talk to Ami and Rei, who were NPCs (non-player characters).

The three levels were divided into two parts. First, Usagi could walk through the city, school or a health spa, occassionally talking to people. After talking to the right people, Usagi turned into Sailor Moon and entered another kind of level in which she fought numerous enemies.

By default, Sailor Moon could only use kicking attacks. Pressing the &amp;quot;down&amp;quot; button would make Sailor Moon sit down and cry, and if there were rocks on the wall nearby, her high-pitched crying would make the rocks explode and drop special items. These items gave different powers: one enabled her to use Moon Tiara Action for a limited number of times, one made her invincible for a short amount of time, etc.
The bosses were Morga, Kyurene, Jadeite, and Queen Beryl. Sailor Moon actually had to fight Jadeite each time after defeating the two Youma, and at the end of the last level, had to fight him again before facing Queen Beryl.</resource>

In this game, the player could play using &amp;quot;story mode&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;arcade mode.&amp;quot; In story mode, the player began play with Usagi Tsukino/Sailor Moon, then Chibiusa, then the Inner Senshi. Gameplay alternated between a story chapter where the player walked around the map and talked to other characters, followed by a platform level, and a boss room. In arcade mode, the player chose a character, and the non-combat parts of the game are skipped.

In both modes, the game was complete after five stages, most of which were rather short. The boss rooms sometimes started with a scene with Tuxedo Mask where the player would receive an extra life for picking up the rose item. Other items the player could pick up included hearts, which refilled some health, cake slices, which refilled more health, and a tiara, which offered a power-up to the character's attacks.</resource>

From time to time a fight may break out, which will provide a close up view of the two players. The player has control during the miniature fight game sequence, with the loser having to spend time in the penalty box.  The referee will break up fights that go on too long, and calls a few penalties such as icing. Several short clips of digitized voices are also featured.</resource>

In doing so, you will prevent it from going off-screen - which will induce a loss of life - and also force it to hit the blocks at the top of the screen. By busting blocks, you will complete levels and earn points. Some special blocks have certain functions to them, such as the lettered ones which drop power-ups.</resource>

    <resource id="57dacfa2c5e7d64a20623bb539975d8418dbbb25" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Blodia is a puzzle game with similarities to sliding block puzzles. Each level is composed of a number of tiles and every one has a part of a pipe (straight or angular) on it - except one which is just a black hole. In one tile a red ball starts rolling and all tiles it rolls through become blank. 

The goal of each level is to let the ball roll through all pipe parts without meeting the hole or a blank tile. 
To ensure this, the player can move the parts while using the hole as buffer. So, as example, if the player clicks on a tile which is a few tiles away from the hole, all tiles between the clicked tile and the hole are moved by one towards the hole. Then the hole is at the place where the player clicked on. At the start of a puzzle, rolling out of the level boundaries is also deadly, but after a certain amount of tiles are cleared the ball comes out at the opposite side of the playfield.

The game features all levels of the TurboGrafx-16 version plus additional ones.</resource>

The game includes Boggle (4x4 grid) and Big Boggle (5x5 grid) variants, along with three additional games based on the same concept. In Anagram, players must unscramble a short sequence of letters to form a meaningful word. In Categories, a 6x6 grid is filled with pre-determined letters and players must find a number of words matching a category like 'musical instruments', 'sports' or 'beauty products'. Use All takes place on a 5x5 grid, with the major challenge being that letters used to form a word are removed from the grid. The goal is to clear the entire grid. The letters can be rescrambled if necessary.

The game can be played by one or two human players who can be joined by up to four CPU players of varying AI levels. All variants can be played as single games or as tournaments up to a certain score.</resource>

This sounds easy, right? Wrong! Making Jack's task difficult are numerous enemies such as birds, mummies, turtles, and orbs.

In each round, collecting a number of bombs results in a bonus coin appearing, and collecting this coin will make the player's score increase 2 to 4 times. More often than not, the &amp;quot;power ball&amp;quot; appears, and when you collect this, you can defeat enemies and have more time to collect all the bombs. There is also the &amp;quot;E&amp;quot; coin, which gives Jack one additional life, but rarely does this coin appear.

The more you progress through the game, the more difficult it becomes, as enemies travel more quickly to get you.</resource>

Bomberman can find several power-ups (extra bombs, or greater range of flame). There are five stages and a boss stage in every location.</resource>

The goal of the level is to collect all of the sparkling chests. In doing so, a key will appear, which you can bring to a door in the level to go to the next one. There are ten levels in each world, and you freely choose to do each world in any order you want.

The main impediment to this process -- other than the clock, which kills you if time runs out -- are the enemies. You can press the B Button to dig a hole and trap enemies within when they walk in. (Holes can also kill you on higher difficulties.) If you want to close a hole, press B while facing it; if an enemy is within, they'll die and you'll gain points. (They will be replaced with a tombstone, which cannot have a hole dug on it anymore.) You'll also possibly gain some items.</resource>

In each level you must collect a certain number of these diamonds, in order to open a portal to the next stage. Enemies can be squashed by falling boulders, which are released when the ground below them is removed or they are pushed onto empty ground, but be careful because these can also squash you. In later levels, difficulty is increased by many puzzle elements and shorter time limits.

There are 16 levels to be completed and five different skill levels available, which affect the number of jewels which must be collected and the time limit.</resource>

Finding the right way to move all the crates on the right spots becomes increasingly difficult and you have to plan numerous steps in advance in order not to block your own way. 

The game features over 25 levels with 10 sub-levels each one. You can always choose the order in which you want to complete the sub-levels, but you have to complete all sub-levels in order to advance to the next main-level. 

If you have finished the game or become hopelessly stuck, there is also an option to create your own levels.</resource>

The main playing field consists of said symbols, but randomly switched around. The player controls a frame which encloses four of the symbols. When pressing a button, the symbols are rotated clockwise around the frame. Of course the levels have to be solved within a time limit.
In the higher difficulty levels, the player also has to deal with so-called special effects which occasionally kick in during play, e.g. some symbols get hidden by &amp;quot;?&amp;quot; blocks, symbols rotate on their own or the controls are reversed. Three power-ups can be earned by completing bonus levels or finishing a level really fast: clock (stops time for 20 seconds), flash (skips the current level) and credit (gives a second try after time has run out).</resource>

The only way to transform back is to reach the end of the cave...

Bubble Bobble is a platform game, with each level being a single screen. The enemies must be cleared from a level to go to the next one. With one player controlling Bub and the other controlling Bob, the player can jump and collect items for points (such as fruit). The real power Bub and Bob have however is the ability to blow bubbles. These bubbles can be as platforms to leap on, or to trap enemies. Enemies trapped in a bubble must be popped by jumping into them, wherein they'll turn to fruit. Additionally, power-ups sometimes float by in bubbles. They include lightning, which flies out horizontally at enemies, and water, which drags the player and enemies straight down flowing over platforms. Taking too long to complete any level will summon Baron Von Blubba, who will float around the screen trying to destroy the player.</resource>

    <resource id="e92d320d6167af08fbfc2136b9da11b2b27f264b" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">BurgerTime Deluxe is a new version of the classic arcade game from 1982, developed for the casual market. As in the original, the player controls a cooking chef that must climb stairs to reach platforms and walk over food pieces, to make them fall and create a complete hamburgers on plates at the bottom of the screen. The cook must avoid touching the roaming enemies, anthropomorphic condiments and fried eggs that kill the main character. The foes can be destroyed with power-ups, or squashed by the falling burger pieces.

There are power-ups and bonus items scattered throughout the levels. The ketchup bottle kills all the enemies on the level, the salt shaker stops their movement for a few seconds, the ice cube makes the chef invulnerable for a few moments and freezes the adversaries, the burning cocktail also makes the cook invulnerable for a short time and burns the approaching foes, the bubble lifts the character directly to an upper level and the energy drink makes the chef temporally faster. Potato chips, ice-cream cones, cups of coffee and tea give bonus points, while French fries give extra lives. A Bonus mini-game appears between levels after collecting the letters that form the name of an ingredient, where the player has to find pairs of food items by uncovering several cooking pots, guide the chef through a maze and complete other similar challenges.

There are two modes in the computer version: in Story Mode, a plot is developed through cutscenes between levels, where two chefs called Peter Pepper and Sally Salt must help their uncle to save the family's burger diner from Vinny Vinegar, the owner of a competing hot dog franchise. Quick Mode is closer to the arcade original, where the levels are randomly generated and the game ends when all the lives are spent. The iPhone version has only the Story Mode, with 60 levels and a smaller view area.</resource>

    <resource id="15b6ec9c4f66778343cadf27007eaf43c878e96a" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">The basic gameplay is pretty straightforward. You're the cute little fellow with the B on his suit. You find yourself at the top of some structure with various creatures climbing to the top. You'll notice there's a crosshair on the screen. Pushing the A button fires a beam wherever that crosshair is aimed at. Move it with the directional pad. Pushing the B button makes your character jump, and pushing Start accesses your item inventory.

Your goal, is to cut out parts of the wall with your beam, causing them to fall on the enemies below. You should be careful not to cut out too big of a piece; otherwise you'll find yourself not having any usable pieces of the wall later on in the level. It can be very easy to do so without noticing.

If an enemy reaches the top of the building, touching it will cause you to lose a turn. It'll either start to crawl towards one side of the screen, or keep flying into the air. It's possible to jump past it and avoid it, however, when it leaves the screen, your enemy count won't go down.</resource>

Besides the obvious differences because of technical limitations of the platform, e.g. the bubbles have to differentiated from of their shades instead of colour, it also has less playing modes. Only the arcade mode (a port of the original arcade version with the main singleplayer campaign or the possibility to challenge an AI opponent) and the challenge mode (beating a series of 25 levels as fast as possible) are available. 

Regarding gameplay, this is a tile matching game. There are bubbles of varying shades at the top of the screen and the player controls a stationary cannon at the bottom of the screen. The cannon is loaded with one bubble at the time and the direction of the shot can be varied left and right. The goal is to clear the screen by matching bubbles of the same colour.</resource>

Boss villains in the game consist of Living Laser and Klaw, Whirlwind, Grim Reaper, Wizard, Mandarin, Juggernaut, Ultron, Controller, Crossbones, and the Red Skull. In addition to the four playable Avengers, Quicksilver makes brief appearances to drop energy replenishments, and the Wasp can add protection and firepower in the shooting areas.</resource>

The plot centers around the &amp;quot;spoiled, grasping inheritor of Whipstaff Manor&amp;quot; - Carrigan Crittenden.  She's after the treasure she thinks is hidden in the walls.  Casper will need the help of Dr James Harvey - therapist to the dead - if he has any hope of succeeding in his adventures.

Casper will also have to deal with his uncles - Stretch, Stinkie and Fatso, who just love to scare &amp;quot;Fleshies&amp;quot; and thwart Casper's efforts.  The gameplay is 3d - and is mostly puzzle solving, with Casper able to take a variety of forms and manipulating objects.</resource>

The game is like a chess clone with fantasy creatures that fight with playing cards. The player's goal is to topple the opponents king. A player controls a small army (with units like orcman, karate man, warrior etc) on a small chess board. If two pieces meet on the same square, they fight on special screen with a playing-card roulette. Depending on the cards that each unit gets they will do damage to an opponent. Different units have different health points and also different cards, for example, some units have more propensity to getting the instantly killing joker card. 

Some units are able to cast attack or defense spells. When these pieces move to an empty square on the map a spell window will open. Each spell can either damage surrounding squares or heal/revive surrounding units. </resource>

None dared challenge him, and the people of the country lived in fear and terror - until a young girl rose up and decided to take matters into her own hands. That young girl was Sonia Belmont, the first in the line of the legendary Belmont clan.

While Castlevania Legends plays similar to the earlier Castlevania titles (the protagonist is only armed with a whip and needs to fight her way through five stages plus a hidden stage), there are also some unique features. While it is impossible to roam the stages freely, quite often the player can choose to go one way or another and in doing so skip some areas or find valuable items, collecting all of which will unlock the best ending. Sonia also possesses special power called Burning mode: once in a level (and once per life) she can boost her speed and attack power and become invincible for a short period of time.</resource>

But watch it! Every maze has monsters patrolling the depths of the labyrinth. Help Catgirl and Catboy push around huge blocks to bridge a path to yet another maze, or topple a block a few stories over the pursuing monsters. If you make a mistake, simply use the rewind function and travel back in time to correct it. With 100 mazes in this labyrinth, it will be quite a challenge to get out of the curse's reach!

Catrap is more than just a game of mindbending intrigue and action. Be the architect of the underground labyrinth and make your own games of intricate puzzles.

Whether you choose to be a maze builder or a maze solver, we know you can help Catboy and Catgirl land on their feet.

Catrap (known as Pitman in Japan) is a puzzle game in which the player maneuvers the player, an anthropomorphic cat, to navigate a room while clearing obstacles and kicking monsters and ghosts off the screen. Once the player has knocked all of the enemies off the screen, he advances to the next level. Advancement can prove difficult for the player as increasingly intricate obstacles are presented to overcome all of the monsters and ghosts. Arguably, the easiest route to solve the problem is through trial and error. A player may try one combination of maneuvers by moving the obstacle in one direction, then he may find himself trapped. The player can hit the 'A'-button to reverse his movements and try again in a different way until he finds the solution that enables him to access all of the baddies to knock them off the screen. Trial and error seems to make up a large portion of the game. Players can also create their own mazes. The game is credited with having originated the time-rewind mechanic.</resource>

    <resource id="631da75e15845be39a91769b3f95c19d73475678" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Cave Noire is a roguelike. The game evolves around four quests (killing monsters, freeing fairies or collecting gold/orbs) with ten difficulties each. The difficulty determines how big the target number is, the stats the player starts with and what monsters are encountered. Starting a quest creates a randomly generated dungeon where the player has one chance to reach the goal - death means a new dungeon has to be created. Beating a difficultly level unlocks the next; this is also the one thing the game saves.

The dungeons itself are shown from a top-down perspective and feature the hero, walls, floor tiles, monsters and items to collect. Movement is turn-based and each turn is divided into four phases (player movement, player attack, monster attack and finally monster movement). Attacks are only possible when the two participants stand besides each other and the computer simply calculates the result from the statistics (attack, defense, luck and a a random component) which then lowers the health points of the attacked hero/monster. Of course reaching a health of zero means defeat. The mentioned statistics can be improved by finding and using certain items like weapons or armor. Potions, spells and rings which have additional effects when used/equipped, e.g. health refreshments, healing poison, dealing much damage or invisibility.

Important to note is that the environment also plays an important part in the quest. The walls and tiles may have special effects when touched, examples are pits (the player/monster falls to the next level of the dungeon and takes damage), breakable walls, lava or teleporters. Some rooms may be covered in fog which obscure the floor tiles until the hero walks onto it (monsters still can be made out). There is a specific kind of monster which clears the whole room when killed - but at the same time another one has the exact opposite effect.</resource>

This remake keeps some of the original game's shooter-style gameplay while mixing in more console-style exploration.  Gameplay progresses through five &amp;quot;worlds&amp;quot;:  Weedom, Frostonia, Infernium, Enigma, and Evile.  Players blast away at the classic centipedes, spiders, fleas, and scorpions while fighting new enemies like the mosquito, cockroach, and killer mushroom.  A &amp;quot;classic&amp;quot; mode is also included, which allows players to play the classic game in a new &amp;quot;3D&amp;quot; isometric perspective.</resource>

    <resource id="17ed5704435f379d15bc615f094d0718852aaa22" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Championship Pool is a pool game where players can 8-ball or 9-ball pool tournament that starts off with the BCA Regional Championship where the player must defeat 32 opponents in a first to four games match. If the player loses against any of the 32 opponents, they are then eliminated from the tournament. The winner of that then goes onto the World Championship.

All of the gameplay is done from a top down view of the table. The player moves an icon to indicate location they want to hit the ball too. To aid in the aiming, a ghost of the cue ball and the first ball that is hit is repetitively played out to show the path of the hit ball. With the all the shots there is a very small margin of error, but this is only notable when a long shot is played or a shot from a sharp angle and the ghost balls will randomly play out all the possible occurrences. The player can also change the power and spin of the played shot with the ghost balls will updating to show the outcome of those changes. 

There are 4 different game modes that can be chosen, each with a different set of pool games. The different game modes and there games are:

1. Tournament: The player must defeat 32 different players in a first to four knockout tournament in 8-ball or 9-ball pool before going on to the World Championship. During the tournament the opponent is never actually is seen playing there shots. Instead, when it is the opponents turn, it cuts to an image of the player with a caption and then returns the control to the player with some balls removed and moved. This way the opponent can finish the game within 4 turns regardless of if they where snookered or not.

2. Challenge:  It has many different pool games that are played, all with one player without an opponent. The games are:
14.1 Challenge ? After the break the ball is placed anywhere at the top of the table behind the line. At that point, the player can hit any ball but once the fails to hit a ball in a hole the game is over. If there is only one ball left on the table the rest of the balls are re-racked and play continues. At the end score is given based on the number of balls that where hit in the holes. The score are tallied up over 5 games to get the total score.

Eight Ball - After the break the ball is placed anywhere at the top of the table behind the line. The player must hit all the chosen set of balls (stripes or solids) and the 8-ball in one turn.  The score is based on how many balls where hit in.

Nine Ball - After the break the ball is placed anywhere at the top of the table behind the line. The player must hit the 9 ball in one turn. The score is based on how many balls where hit in.

Equal Offence ? Same as 14.1 Challenge but there is only one game played.

Three Pool ? Only have 3 balls on the table. Score is based on how many shots it takes to get all three balls in with lower been better.

Speed Pool ? Objective is to hit all the balls in as quickly as possible as a timer is timing how long the game takes. Any ball can be hit at any time and the player can miss the shot and not be penalised (other than taking longer).3. Party:  It has many different multiplayer pool games that are played with ether just 2 or 2 to 8 human players. The games are:
Eight Ball (2 Players)  ? A standard eight ball game with the players taking turns to play.

Nine Ball (2-8 Players)  ? A standard nine ball game with up to 8 players taking turns. First player to get the 9-ball in wins.

14.1 Continuous (2 Players)  ? Players can hit any ball in for a point. If a shot is missed then other player plays. If there is only one ball on the table the pocketed balls are re-racked. Play continues until one of the players reaches the score chosen at the start of the game.

Ten Ball (2-8 Players)  ? Same as Nine Ball except with 10 balls.

Rotation (2-8 Players)  ? Only the lowest ball can be hit and the score for getting a ball in is the value of the ball (e.g. 8-ball is 8 points). Player with the highest score at the end of the game wins.

Straight Pool (2 Players)  ?  Same as 14.1 Continuous but the player with the highest score after one game wins.

Equal Offence (2-8 Players)  ?  Same as Equal Offence in challenge mode but players can take turns to beat each others score.

Fifteen Ball (2-8 Players)  ? Same as Rotation except that any ball can be hit not just the lowest.

One Pocket (2 Players)  ? The two players are given one of the two pockets at the end of the table. The player must hit all the balls in there nominated pocket with the one with the most balls wins.
  
Three Ball (2-8 Players)  ? Same as Three Ball in challenge mode but players can take turns to beat each other?s score.

Speed Ball (2-8 Players)  ? Same as Speed Ball in challenge mode but players can take turns to beat each other?s score.4. Freestyle: Lets the player practice with no opponent, no penalties, the ability to move any ball to the desired location (or remove by throwing the ball in the pocket), and the ability to place potted balls back on the table.</resource>

You are given a mission briefing before you start which gives information on the suspect and what car they drive. Then you drive across the city without crashing into other cars, and catch up with the criminal's car. To arrest the suspects, you must keep bumping into their car until it is no longer functional. And you have to do this under a strict time limit. You can't afford to crash into cars or buildings or you waste time getting on the road again. 

However, once you've caught up with your suspect, you are given more time. Your car is also equipped with turbo boosts, which you can use to gain extra speed if you are way behind the criminal. Each arrest is based on a &amp;quot;suspicion&amp;quot;.

You can play training games (with all the hints and analysis tools available), rated games (your rating changes after each play), puzzles (chess ones, not the &amp;quot;build the picture&amp;quot; type), learn chess by browsing through the hundreds of tutorials available in the Pandolfini's Chess School or watch famous games.

There are, however, some new features in the PS2 version; the most useful one is the Online mode. Other is the &amp;quot;living world&amp;quot; of the Chessmaster Championships, where the AI's rating changes, too, as they play each other. The last one is more spectacular - a  fantasy-themed - orcs vs. humans - game mode with animated chess sets and a 3D environment. You get to play chess in a forest, inside a castle and in the desert.</resource>

Take off on a dangerous rescue mission in a world on the brink of all-out global war. Hostages must be saved from a sly and sinister enemy in order to avert total chaos. Only your skill can save us now.

You command the AH 90 Commanche attack helicopter, the ultimate fighting machine. Your arsenal includes: machine guns, flame throwers, missiles and invisibility. Superior technology must be used wisely against the omnipresent enemy. Antagonists attack with everything they've got: bullets, missiles, tanks, subterranean gun turrets and land mines. Hectic heli-heroics are required to save the hostages and yourself.

ChopLifter II features five stages, each with it's own threatening terrain. The game can be played by one or two players.</resource>

The helicopter does not only take damage from enemy fire, but also from contact with buildings, trees, walls etc., which makes some levels difficult to navigate.

Enemies can be destroyed by either using the helicopter's standard weapon, or more powerful weapons that can be picked up throughout the levels. The main task of each level however, is picking up a certain number of hostages and taking them to your home base.</resource>

The game is a side-scrolling platformer.  Chuck fights of a variety of dinosaurs using his belly-buster attack and a jump kick.  Occasionally he has to pick up and throw rocks to defeat enemies and allow him to jump to greater heights.</resource>

Sly must fight thugs and the elements as he tracks down suitcases of stolen cash dropped around the peaks of the Rockies. Combat follows the Final Fight standard, broken up by some mountain climbing and running (or 3-D snowboarding on the Sega CD) from avalanches. 

Enemies are the standard brawler crooks, occasionally carrying guns and knives the player can pick up. The game tends to follow a pattern of having you deal with a natural hazard (scaling a cliff, leaping over gaps), then locking the screen down for a fighting segment, nature again, fighting again, etc. The available fighting moves is limited, compared to other games of this type, and the ability to hit an enemy character is noticeably less accurate.

The plot is identical to the film, with levels based off of, or inspired by, scenes in the movie. Animated cutscenes move the story along on the cartridge systems, while brief clips from the film play between levels on the Sega CD.</resource>

Shinnosuke's family was initially composed of four members, including Shinnosuke, Misae Nohara (the mother), Hiroshi Nohara (the father) and Shiro (the dog). Family members reach five when the last one arrives, Shinnosuke's little sister, Himawari Nohara. Also on the family side, his angry and often authoritarian grandfather Yoshiji is the opposite of his other grandfather, Ginnosuké, nicknamed &amp;quot;Ginny&amp;quot;, who is joking and also perverse. Shinnosuke hangs out most of the time with four of his friends: Nene, Kazama, Masao and Bo. He goes to nursery school where he attends teachers such as Mademoiselle Yoshinaga and Mademoiselle Matsuzaka as well as the principal of the school, Mr. Takakura, whom he and his friends nickname &amp;quot;The godfather&amp;quot; because of his dress and his mafia appearance. Shin-chan is secretly in love with his former teacher, Nanako Ōhara, and also a fan of two superheroes he particularly appreciates, Action Kamen and Cuntom Robo.</resource>

Enemies in each level take lives when they touch you. There are extra lives and upgrade pods that can be collected to increase speed, destroy dense blocks, jump, and even shoot missiles. 

Every couple of minutes, a large rock monster stomps his way on the scene respawning blocks previously destroyed, so be careful you don't occupy the same space. The stages also feature alternative paths and boss fights. Passwords allow you to resume at the beginning of each stage. </resource>

At a few points, you'll be accompanied by some robot helpers, who show up at specific points in each stage to spring you over walls or supply extra firepower. It also has a particularly cool final battle where the roles are reversed - instead of being a lone character against a huge machine, you control a huge machine against one single character, a wily ninja who blinks in and out of existence. This one was only released in Japan.</resource>

Bradley, F-15, F-16.... Like in other Daisenryaku games, each side has to produce units such as infantry, several types of tanks, helicopters, etc. Different units have different strengths and weaknesses. The outcome of combat is determined by the attack strength which varies between different unit types. Game has 6 maps, can be played both against the console or against another human player.</resource>

As a decent super-hero, his role is to save the city from his enemies.

Graphics are cartoonish, like other Disney licenses developed by Capcom, but darker.

Gameplay is similar to Mega Man and Duck Tales, in the same jump and run style. Controls are easy to handle.</resource>

That's right, the jelly bean-loving Blob and his faithful Earth-boy companion are back in a brand-new adventure! This time out, the duo's exploits take them to the Royal Castle of Blobolonia, Blob's home planet, as they attempt to free the lovely-and imprisoned-Princess Blobette from the clutches of the treacherous Antagonistic Alchemist.

Join our heroes as they encounter secret rooms, clever traps, and dangerous obstacles in the labyrinthine depths of the castle. But all is not lost-these two share a very special secret: With each flavor of jelly bean the boy feeds Blob, Blob will magically transform into a different shape that can help this intrepid pair get past just about anything the Alchemist can conjure up!

The Rescue of Princess Blobette tells the story of a young, male protagonist and his blob companion as they attempt to rescue the latter's girlfriend, the titular Princess Blobette. The damsel in distress has been imprisoned by the Antagonistic Alchemist within the highest tower of the Royal Castle on the planet Blobolinia. Like its predecessor, A Boy and His Blob: Trouble on Blobolonia, The Rescue of Princess Blobette is a puzzle-platformer in which the player directly controls the boy as he is followed around by the blob, who is controlled by the computer AI. The pair must navigate the various passages and floors of the castle to locate and free Blobette. The boy can only run back and forth, cannot jump or swim, and will die if he falls a long distance or comes in contact with dangerous objects such as flame throwers and sewer serpents. However, the blob can be made to turn into useful tools when he is fed jelly beans of various flavors. Each flavor causes a different transformation. For example, feeding the blob a tangerine jelly bean will change him into a trampoline, which the boy can then use to reach high platforms. The player may also locate extra jelly bean sacks and numerous, optional treasures. Finding five peppermints will increase the player's extra lives by one.</resource>

If you mentally change the driver names, it can be thought of as a recreation of real NASCAR racing rather than a direct recreation of the film. 

You play Cruise's Cole Trickle character (his name, like many of the others, is slightly different to that of a real NASCAR racer of the day) against your rivals on 8 tracks, based on real-life counterparts. The races are all on ovals, although the exact lengths, corner types and gradients are varied.  This means that the ideal racing line on one track can put you into the wall on another. Qualifying is incorporated alongside the races themselves.

From times to times you'll have to pull into the pit stop area. When doing so, you control the five members of the pit crew. Loosing time on pit will make you lose positions at the race. The other racers, however, never pit.

The NES version has 3rd-Person perspective only.</resource>

Dennis is a platform game across settings such as Sewers, the Park, and Mr. Wilson?s house, each of which has an end-of-level bad guy. The in-level opposition follows standard attack patterns and can usually be avoided. The enemies regenerate as you move on, although you generally only progress from bottom-left to top-right anyway. 

Some of the holes in the ground are deadly while others lead to secret rooms. Fortunately, you are given up to 9 lives at the start, and lots of extra lives are on offer throughout the game, so these are well worth checking out. A choice between music and sound effects is offered.</resource>

    <resource id="8c6672016fbe5637bf1460408f9da848df6baf28" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Dexterity is a puzzle game with a 7x8 grid, each one filled with a tile or another item. The goal is to flip over all tiles within a time limit. This has to be triggered manually by pressing a button, but if there is another flipped tile on the field, all other tiles between the player's position and the other tile will flip, too. Some grids are filled with stationary blocks, moveable blocks (either pushing them normally or send them flying with a strong kick) and holes.

There are also monsters which need to be avoided. All five of them have different behaviour patterns and have the ability to reverse already flipped tiles; some of them can even push blocks or destroy tiles. The monsters can be killed by using blocks against them: pushing them over the borders of the playfield or a hole will kill them. Alternatively they also can be trapped. Killed monsters slowly respawn at pre-defined spawn points; this takes place over several phases. In the &amp;quot;egg&amp;quot; phase, it can be picked up to kill another enemy with it. Another possible weapon are stunned enemies which stood on a multi-flipped row.

When pushing blocks into a corner, they will disappear and transform into power ups, e.g. bonus points, extra time or a temporary stun of all enemies. A life is lost when an enemy is touched or the time runs out. When that happens, all flipped tiles stay flipped.</resource>

While the Prime Evils of Hell were engaged in war their lesser lieutenants conspired to overthrow them. They mutinied suddenly with the combined forces of Hell, overwhelming the three Primes. Stripped of their power, they were banished to the mortal realm. Human agents of Heaven, upon discovering this, found the three Primes and sealed them within gemstone prisons, each of them sent to a different corner of the earth and kept under guard to prevent them from escaping.

As years turns to centuries, however, the power of Heaven's agents waned, until eventually not even the people of the town of Tristram knew that buried deep under their chapel was the soul of the Lord of Terror, Diablo. As the strength of his prison waned Diablo reached out into the world, corrupting the dreams of the land's good king, driving him to attack his neighbors. The nation of Khanduras fought wars with no intention of winning, desiring only slaughter and suffering. Now the lands lay scorched, home only to monsters and the dead. Rumors spread of a way to stop the demons, as well as rumors of great wealth, and both draw adventurers from far to the small town of Tristram.</resource>

There are five different weapons in the game: hand gun, tommy gun, super punch, tear gas and Tracy's plain fists. There are also medical kits that can be found. Enemies can be armed or unarmed. If Tracy shoots an unarmed thug, he loses health.

The main goal of the game is to collect five clues; enough to be able to arrest the culprit. Clues are scattered all over town in various buildings, usually full of Tracy-hating thugs.

Stopping you from doing this are two monsters, called Pooka and Fygar, who will continually chase you around. The only weapon that you carry is an air pump, which you can use to inflate the monsters to the point where they explode. (if you start to inflate them but stop doing so, the monsters will get turned back to their normal selves). Furthermore, rocks are scattered throughout the earth, and you can use these rocks to squash them. If the monsters do not find you for several seconds, they will eventually get turned into ghosts, which are able to walk through the earth. They are invincible and cannot be killed. From time to time, vegetables will appear in the center, and you can get these for points.

Dinosaurs have a set amount of hit points and if they are taken down to zero they will die leaving players the option to start the whole game over or start again at the last checkpoint with the current dinosaur.</resource>

This leaves Dixie stuck with minding her baby cousin Kiddy Kong.  Frustrated at this, she decides to take Kiddy with her and find The Lost World before everyone else!

As with Donkey Kong Country 3: Dixie Kong's Double Trouble!, Dixie Kong takes the lead in the third chapter of the Donkey Kong Land series. Dixie can glide using her hair, and carries barrels over her head.  Her partner is the heavy Kiddy, who carries barrels in front of him, and can jump a bit further by somersaulting over platform edges first.

There are also special animal friends that can help the two primates out.  Ellie the Elephant can shoot water at enemies, while Enguarde the Swordfish can glide through water with ease. Squawks the Parrot can fly and spit eggs, and Squitter the Spider can shoot webbing as well as use it to create new platforms.

Each level has Bonus Coins and DK Coins tucked well away in the levels.  While it's possible to gain an ending without these, to complete the game properly, players must seek them all out and unlock levels of the fabled 'Lost World'.  A new feature to the game series is a Time Attack mode - once players finish the game, they can attempt to beat the best time for certain levels.</resource>

Together, they manage a small martial arts training school, teaching their students in self-defense. One day, Billy's girlfriend, Marian, is kidnapped off the street by the &amp;quot;Black Warriors&amp;quot;, a savage street gang led by a man named Willy. The Black Warriors demand the Lee brothers disclose their martial arts secrets in exchange for Marian's freedom. The Lee brothers set out on a rescue mission to crush the Black Warriors and save Marian.

Using whatever techniques they have at their disposal, from the basic punches and kicks to the invulnerable elbow strike, as well any weapon that comes into their hands, the Lee brothers must pursue the gang through the city slum, industrial area and the forest before reaching their hideout to confront the big boss, Willy.

The NES version of this game also has an additional VS. fighting mode for one or two players. Players choose from a field of six different characters (Billy and 5 of the enemy characters) and enter into a one-on-one fighting match. Players have to punch, kick, jumpkick, and even use a weapon against their opponents until someone's health bar is fully drained. The winner is the last one standing.</resource>

The Dragons must now embark on a mission to avenge her death and defeat the Black Warriors for the second and final time.

The original arcade version of &amp;quot;Double Dragon II&amp;quot; was essentially an improved version of the first game. In addition to offering renewed audio and visuals, as well as new traps, moves and enemy characters, &amp;quot;Double Dragon II&amp;quot; discarded the conventional punch and kick buttons in favor of a direction-oriented attacking system similar to the original Technos beat-em-up Renegade.

The NES version offered new stages, new moves and illustrated cut-scenes, as well as a new final boss and a new ending. Unlike the first NES game, it offered 2-Player Co-Op gameplay with the option to turn off the friendly fire.

The Game Boy version of &amp;quot;Double Dragon II&amp;quot; is an English localization of a &amp;quot;Kunio-kun&amp;quot; game (the Japanese franchise which inspired &amp;quot;Renegade&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;River City Ransom&amp;quot; and has nothing to do with the arcade and NES versions.

Nobody hesitates to participate. Nekketsu High School, led by Kunio, Hanazono High School led by Riki and Interschool Union led by Gouda all announce their participation in the competition. Thus Toudou can begin his plot with the 4 teams in place.</resource>

The electricity bill hasn't been paid in some time, and now Franky need to find the cash to pay it off. The locals have trapped Franky inside the late doctor's private manor, and you (as Franky) must escape and piece together the golden tablet depicting your beautiful girlfriend Bitsy to pay the bills.

Dr. Franken II is a side-scrolling platformer what places you in control of a Frankenstein-like character named Franky. The goal is collect different objects within different levels to put something back together. In order for Franky to recharge his health, you need to find the parts to fix the electricity machine that does it. You will also be taken to exotic locales such as Egypt and the bottom of the ocean to find pieces of Bitsy's golden tablet.

Like its predecessor, there are many trap doors, monsters, and other obstacles that need to be overcome. Keys are needed to unlock new areas of the game, which can be found in the far reaches of the level.</resource>

Align three pills of the same colour to a virus of the corresponding colour (or any combination of pills and viruses totaling four or more) and it will be removed from the bottle, along with the aligned pills. The level is cleared when there are no viruses left, and the game is over when the pills reach the top and Dr. Mario can't drop any more pills.

Included in the game is the normal mode, a time trial, and a two player battle mode to see who can remove the most viruses.</resource>

Gameplay differs somewhat from the original Dragon Slayer in that there are now outdoors areas, as well as npcs that send you on specific quests. Combat is still real-time, but a new attack button brings the game closer to other action-rpgs like Zelda.</resource>

    <resource id="7b708e6e5e9a02b0f255da552e27bd15367032a5" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Dragon Slayer is commonly considered one of the progenitors of the action RPG genre. The premise is similar to Roguelikes: the player takes control of a knight who must fight his way through large overhead maze-like dungeons. Unlike roguelikes, the combat in the game is fully action-oriented: the player must approach the monster and &amp;quot;bump&amp;quot; into it in order to inflict damage, at the same time trying to avoid its blows. Combat takes place on the same screen as the exploration; monsters will also sometimes pursue the knight if he attempts to escape. Also contrary to roguelikes, none of the locations or items in the game is randomized.
The player can collect power stones and coins during the journey; the power stones increase the hero's strength, while the coins increase his hit points (health). Defeating enemies also yields experience points, which determine the amount of maximum HP the hero is able to receive.</resource>

    <resource id="d6285c3fbede29f395ba558fcd685200bcb179a4" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">The Game Boy version for Dragon's Lair is actually a port of Roller Coaster, with its protagonist replaced by Dirk the Daring. Dirk must collect all &amp;quot;lifestones&amp;quot; scattered all around the game world (by walking or jumping) to finally save Princess Daphne. The game world is divided in several screens which can be freely navigated and are a little wider than Game Boy's screen. As Dirk moves the screen will scroll and when its limit is reached, it will flick to a new one. To help him move around, Dirk can jump over bumper cars, flying magic hats and other kinds of moving platforms.

Dirk starts with 10 lives which can be lost by falling from high platforms, touching spikes or landing on water or fire. The main theme is somewhat reminiscent from the NES version. The game can be played in two different speeds and can also be played by two players taking turns.

The player controls a spaceman with a jet-pack, flying across a barren landscape whose skies are inhabited by a number of different aliens, from the simple Planter to the slowly advancing Blunder Storm or the quick, aggressive Nemesite. 

Planters and Nemesites will try to pickup the small men walking on the surface, who must then be rescued. The player has to shoot down the alien, while avoiding to hit the man. Sometimes, the aliens will carry an android, which is similar to the human but deadly. Care must be taken so as to not pick up the androids. All men must be transported to a surface base, where they are put in safety - this is the Dropzone.</resource>

Duck Tales 2 is the sequel to the NES and Game Boy game, Duck Tales.  Based on the Disney cartoon of the same name, players control Uncle Scrooge as he searches the globe for massive amounts of wealth while trying to discover hidden pieces of the map.

Scrooge's main method of attack is his cane - by jumping in the air and holding the B Button, the cane turns into a pogo stick, allowing players to jump onto most enemies' heads and cross dangerous terrain like spikes with ease.  By pushing up against a wall or an object, Scrooge will whack his cane like a golf club, either sending the object flying or occasionally revealing secret items.  New to Duck Tales 2 is the ability to push and pull certain objects with the cane after hitting them.

Familiar faces such as Huey, Dewey and Louie, Webby, Mrs. Beakley, and Launchpad McQuack all turn up to lend a hand.  Scrooge will even bump into the crazy inventor, Gyro Gearloose, who will improve Scrooge's cane so that he can access even more secret areas.</resource>

The game offers two single player and two multiplayer modes. The single player mode called &amp;quot;Game B&amp;quot; has the classical Bomberman gameplay, while the mode &amp;quot;Game A&amp;quot; introduces several variations. The levels in Game A are divided in nine areas, which can be accessed in any order from a world map. Depending on the time taken to finish a level and the number of blocks destroyed, the player gets a certain amount of gold, which can be used to buy power-ups (called &amp;quot;panels&amp;quot; in the game) in shop, which in term is accessed from the map. Power-ups allow, for example, to revive Bomberman when he dies in a stage or to increase the length of an explosion. Before entering a new area, the player chooses which panels to use in order to complete the area.

The multiplayer mode are both player vs. player modes. In &amp;quot;Panel mode&amp;quot;, each player can place only one bomb at a time and the bombs' radius starts at one, but panels appear in the field to improve this. In &amp;quot;Powerful mode&amp;quot;, no panels appear, but each player can place up to four bombs at a time and the radius is four.</resource>

There are several ways in which Agent 17 can kill them: shooting them with his gun, kicking them by jumping onto them, shooting a light on the ceiling while in an elevator, dropping the light onto one of them and crushing them with an elevator.nnnnWhenever a light has been dropped, the hallways will be dark for a short period of time, making the enemy spies harder to see. The same holds true for hallways that are already dark.</resource>

The gameplay features an action/strategy part similar to Boulder Dash, and a question part. In the action part, you need to collect five question marks and enough Manna to open the exit of the maze-like screens. There are a variety of boulders, walls, dirt, and other obstacles in the way. Some obstacles can be destroyed when moses uses his staff to say the word of god, other obstacles can be pushed out of the way, and some you must find a way around. You need to be careful when navigating around the screens, if you cause any boulders to fall and they land on you a life is lost. Also wandering about are a variety of enemies which can be destroyed or avoided, but will cost you one life if you get caught. When you find all the question marks and manna you need, the exit appears and you can move on to the question phase.</resource>

The count is full, so the runners will be going. Here's the wind-up and the pitch..Oh, Wade got all of that one!!.. it's going...going....Cole races back to the warning track... It's Gone!!! Home Run!!!&amp;quot;

Now you can experience all the excitement of a neck and neck pennant race with Extra Bases. Pitch, bat, field, and run the bases just like in a professional baseball game. You can also control all the coaching decisions like bringing in your ace relief pitcher or calling for a suicide squeeze play. Extra Bases is the next best thing to actually playing the game. So step up to the plate and Play Ball!!</resource>

It features the same isometric gameplay graphics, the same teams (51 national teams plus the all-star THQ Tornados) and the same game modes: exhibition matches, tournaments (group stage plus knockout stage), playoffs (only the knockout stage) and a league mode.

Changes are an entirely new menu frontend and revised controls. In particular, the Game Boy's two buttons no longer distinguish between the strength of kicks with the choice between a goal kick and a pass depending entirely on the situation; the buttons for passes and kicks are now distinct.</resource>

The televisual presentation, one of the unique points of the early EA Sports titles, with hosts introducing the matches, was another thing making the game stand out from a market dominated by Sensible Soccer and Kick Off games.

Based on international teams (with fictional player names), their abilities in each skill area rated out of 10 to give the player an overall impression of how good they are. The options available follow the standard set: fouls and offsides can be toggled on and off, the match length can be set, and if the timer operates  continuously, or only while the ball is in play. Gameplay privileges quick runs, short passes and blistering shots outside the penalty box, and set pieces are controlled by moving a box into the target area for the ball, and then passed, lobbed or kicked directly. On the tactical side, formations can be selected, with 5 different strategies also available (although not all of these combinations make sense) as can the team Coverage - the areas which defenders, midfielders and strikers cover.</resource>

If you're not satisfied with the composition of the various teams, you can create your own dream team through the custom team creator.

British commentator John Motson comments all the incidents and happenings on the pitch in real-time. The ambient commentary is varied, and systems with more than the minimum memory level get extra commentary phrases. The Virtual Stadium technology has numerous pre-defined camera angles.</resource>

You control a H.A.P.P.Y.F.A.C.E., or Holographically Assisted Physical Pattern Yielded For Active Computerized Embarkation. The graphics consist of flat shaded corridors. Enemies are all simple geometric shapes with smiley faces on them. Although the graphics are simple, they allow for full freedom of movement, not unlike Wolfenstein 3-D.

There are two modes of play. First there is a single player mode in which your goal is to find the exit to each level.  There are 70 mazes in this mode. The second mode is the multiplayer arena. For the Game Boy: up to 4 Game Boys can be linked together in this mode.</resource>

You can choose between a one player or two player simultaneous mode. At the start you must choose a horse. Horses have different skill levels like speed, stamina or jump. During the race the horses and the course are displayed from a top-down view. You increase the speed of your horse by using your whip, which in return results in an energy decrease, so it must be used with care. There are two different surface types (lawn and dirt) and some courses have obstacles that you have to jump over. You must place at least in the top 4 of each race to continue with the game. Placing higher increases the prize money. Besides a mode that concentrates purely on the racing part you can choose a so called &amp;quot;Family Game&amp;quot; which includes a betting part in addition to the racing.</resource>

The Professor has kidnapped Kitty, Felix girlfriend, trying to exchange her for Felix' magic bag. Naturally, Felix is not going to let himself be blackmailed, and instead sets out to free Kitty. 

There are four different types of levels. 


Typical platforming levels in which Felix has to make his way to the exit while jumping about obstacles and chasms, killing enemies using different weapons.

Swimming levels in which Felix rides a float or on the back of a dolphin.

Levels that take place entirely under water.

Flying levels that put Felix in control of different flying devices, such as a plane, a hot-air balloon or an umbrella.


Throughout all levels, Felix can collect cat symbols to improve his weapons. After collecting a certain number of cat symbols, milk bottles or hearts will appear. Hearts improve Felix' current weapon. What types of weapon Felix can use, depends on what type of level he is in. There are lots of different weapons ranging from a boxing glove to motorcycles to tanks to spaceships. All weapons that are better than the standard weapon have an energy bar that diminishes over time and can be refilled by collecting milk bottles. Getting hit by an enemy decreases the level of Felix' current weapon. If he gets hit while carrying the standard weapon, he loses a life.

The Game Boy version plays virtually identically to the NES version, but features less levels.</resource>

The qualification race determines where the players vehicle will be placed at the beginning of the main race. The player is rewarded points which determine their standings at the end of a main race with more points being given for the higher position finished in the race. Also during a race, the player can make a pit stop to change their worn down tires and to refuel, which involves playing a minigame.

Fidgetts can lift and drop items to help them climb over obstacles. Within each level the player must get both Fidgetts to the exit before a time runs out. There's pit traps and enemies that can cause the Fidgetts to loose lives or receive damage.

In between levels the player can play a Breakout variant in which the player controls a paddle at both the top and bottom of the screen. In between the blocks that can be destroyed with the ball are power-ups that can be collected.</resource>

The major changes are in the character classes and party members. Similar to FFL, starting a game of Legends II allows you to choose your main character from Humans, Monsters, Mutants and a new class: Robots. From here, you build your party of 4 from the same character classes. During gameplay special side-characters will join you in battle to help defeat certain enemies. 

The other improvement is in strategy. In FFL you gain experience points after each battle, increasing strength, etc. In FFLII, you gain different points and abilities depending on how you defeated the enemy. If you win by using a sword, your strength increases. If you use magic, your mana increases. This adds a more strategic approach to defeating enemies.</resource>

As you control a party of 4, with a choice of human and mutant classes, and travel back and forth through time collecting pieces of the great ship Talon so as to defeat the enemy that has flooded the lands.

The inclusion of a time travel storyline means that whatever you do in one time frame can have an affect on what happens in another time. Other major changes compared to the original 2 in the series are the ability to mutate your characters further and a change to the upgrade system.
Items picked up after battle can be attached to your mutants or humans to turn them into monsters or robots, increasing your parties power and abilities.
And although the original system of obtaning experience points after every battle has been removed, its replacement allows you to choose which magic stone each character can use, so they learn that specific magic type and never lose it.</resource>

No matter which you choose, the goal stays the same: Increase your experience points and abilities by defeating many varied enemies through-out the land.

Much like the FF series of old (and new), you can choose members to join your party and the quest that lies ahead (either warriors, mutants or creatures). Every character has a limit to the amount of moves available during every battle and experience points are gained after each fight, increasing stamina, power, etc.</resource>

A title playable for two, certainly particular, but not uninteresting.</resource>

You have to run quickly through the levels (there is a time limit), punching and kicking your enemies, causing them to fly away or to explode, occasionally meeting a boss, visiting secret areas behind doors and collecting various power-ups. 

This is in fact the second game in the series; the first one was never released outside of Japan.</resource>

The main difference is that the game features two playing modes with 80 levels each: one is puzzle oriented while the other features more enemies. The levels themselves are a mix between the levels featured in the PC-88 and NES versions.

The game itself is a puzzle game in which the player controls a mole who has to push a blue stone on an specially marked place. The stone can only be pushed, but not pulled. While Flappy does not care about gravity, the blue and red stones do: they fall down if pushed off an edge. This has to be used to clear a path for the blue stone and to crush enemies which try to hurt Flappy. Touching them or being crushed by a stone results in the loss of a life.</resource>

Players can also choose to play in a Knockout-style tournament where instead of a round robin type of play like in World Cup, they instead play one game and advance to the next like a regular tournament. There is also a two-player mode that allows friends to compete head-to-head.

The main gameplay is the same as others with an overhead view with a third-person perspective for penalty kicks. The rules and regulations are up to date and can actually be changed to suit the players style of choice. They can also choose weather conditions, skills of goalies or even the choice to play either indoors or outdoors. Players can also edit their players including appearance and stats wise to suit their liking.</resource>

A full range of punches and jabs are available, with full round-by-round scoring from the judges. You can choose from 3-12 rounds, and there are 2 camera views as well as an automatic switch option.

You can play simple exhibition matches or tournaments, or launch into a career mode. In this you start at the bottom of the world rankings, and must reach the top by beating the game's players, who other than George are all fictitious boxers with varying strengths and weaknesses. The coach gives advice before each fight to help highlight weaknesses in your play. There are passwords for each round.</resource>

There are 6 distinct game modes, allowing for single exhibition matches as well as full seasons on the playoffs. There is also a Home Run Derby mode, allowing the player to pelt the ball out of the ground for points. 

You can choose pitchers and batters, based on their statistics and form. Bowling options are set to define the delivery, with fastballs and curveballs as well as more precise setting of pace and height. Fielding is optional - it's best to leave this to the computer at first You can always alter the infield and outfield depth and shift.</resource>

The object of the game is to provide enough water for a shower by crawling along a network of plumbing pipes and picking up/replacing loose pieces. Various types of mice are the game's antagonists, trying to thwart Tom in different ways: knocking pipes loose to disrupt the water flow, jumping down to fall on him, or setting a bomb to blow up the entire plumbing arrangement. A version for the Atari 5200 was programmed in 1983, but was never published.[1] It was, however, released for the Nintendo Game Boy in 1995 and the PlayStation in 2002. A Bandai Electronics VFD hand held version of Frisky Tom was released in 1982.[2]

Mouskattack, another game featuring both mice and a pipe-laying theme, was published in 1982 by Sierra On-Line for the Atari 8-bit family and Apple II.</resource>

Both these sections are fraught with a variety of hazards, each of which will kill the frog and cost you a life if contact is made.

The road is full of cars and trucks, at variable speeds. The river water itself is fatal, as are the snakes which hover within on later levels. Frogger must use the arrangement of logs, turtles (which are only there for a short time) and alligators (but stay away from their faces), and then jump into one of the open home-cells, ideally one containing a fly for extra points. Once all holes have been filled, you move onto the next, harder, level.</resource>

The compilation consists of four popular titles from the Game &amp; Watch Series, each with a &amp;quot;Classic&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Modern&amp;quot; version of each game:

1. Octopus: Collects as much treasure as your bag can hold, while avoiding the octopus tentacles that continually swing around you.  In the &amp;quot;Modern&amp;quot; version, Mario becomes the diver, and as he collects more treasure, his bag becomes heavier, making it harder to return to the surface.  Mario can also delay the octopus tentacles by throwing treasure at them.

Fire: Position your net to catch the falling people jumping from the burning building.  The &amp;quot;Modern&amp;quot; version has Mario and Luigi rescuing Toad, Yoshi and Donkey Kong Jr. from Princess Peach's Castle.  Each falling character has different weights and falling patterns.

Manhole: The player must cover the holes to keep the continually walking people from falling through the manholes and into the sewers.  In the &amp;quot;Modern&amp;quot; version, Yoshi must use his tongue to keep Mario, Toad and Donkey Kong Jr. from falling thought the hole, each character having different speeds and patterns.

Oil Panic: The player must collect the dripping blobs of oil before they slip past and ruin everything.  The &amp;quot;Modern&amp;quot; version has Bowser dropping oil blobs at Mario, who has to catch the oil and dump it over to Yoshi before the Koopa King gets the best of Mario.

Each mode (Classic and Modern) has two difficulties: Easy and Hard.  The higher score a player gets in each version, new unlockable bonuses will become available via the &amp;quot;Gallery Corner&amp;quot;.  These bonuses include release dates, pictures and animations which tell in greater detail the history behind Gunpei Yokoi's portable creations.</resource>

    <resource id="45045cf7c55bfb5c72661b62a7a2aa544f270da5" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">The second entry in Nintendo's Wars series pits two parties against each other: it's the Red Star army versus the White Moon army in turn-based battles over 16 maps, which, unlike in the previous game, are arranged in hexagonal grids.

On each map, the goal is to either destroy all enemy forces or capture the enemy's capital city. 24 different troop types are available, which can be given various orders from attacking enemy units to supporting friendly ones to besieging or capturing enemy cities or installations. Battles are shown as small animated sequences.

Building (and repairing) units requires income, which is generated by occupying cities or production facilities. What units can be constructed where depends on the building type: factories and cities build land units, airports and harbors are required for air and sea units, respectively.

The game offers a battery-based save game feature even in the midst of playing a map, as well as a two-player feature, with two players sharing a Game Boy and taking turns.</resource>

Turbo also features 50 new maps, as well as Super Game Boy support.

An alternate version of Game Boy Wars Turbo was released as a promotional giveaway by Weekly Famitsu featuring a set of maps submitted by readers of the magazine.</resource>

You control a spacecraft situated on a globe which you can rotate and move around the screen. You must knock globes into others of the same colour, to rid the screen of all the globes. The screen has no borders, so globes can be pushed off the side of the screen, increasing your tactical range. Knocking globes of different colors into each other produces smaller pods which need to be picked up quickly, giving you energy, or they will turn into globes and you will have to get rid of them too. Many of the globes are linked to other globes (or the ship) via string, and the level layouts include barriers as obstacles (and ricochet points), making the Newtonian physics more complex.</resource>

Its battle system is similar to that of an RPG game, but other than that, the similarities end there.

Most of the attacks rely on Button Combos, but the game provides a list of combos for the more inexperienced player.

Gamera's enemies are Gyaos, Guiron and Viras. Eventually, the game's final battle pits Gamera against a clone of himself.

The game's language is in Japanese, but an English fan translation does exist.</resource>

Your task on each level is to use a number of gears of one of 3 different sizes to ensure that all the cogs are linked together. All this has to be completed before the engine overheats.

Making life harder are two creatures with the peculiar name &amp;quot;Poffins&amp;quot;. One of these goes around removing pegs, and the other causes the engine to overheat further. They can be shot out of the way, or have gears placed over them to stop them.

There's also a bonus round, which is a fruit machine, only with cogs and other things from the game rather than fruit.

    <resource id="7f90138ba3e48ad16c1fcf845f7c2405d2a49fbe" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">The Master System and Game Gear versions of George Foreman's KO Boxing are fairly identical to the other versions in concept, but there are a few notable changes. The game is a reworking of the Master System title James 'Buster' Douglas Knockout Boxing, not to be confused with the Genesis title with the same name, which is entirely different.

Just like the other versions players are cast as George Foreman to go through a series of boxing matches against different opponents to win the championship title belt. Compared to the other titles, these versions have new opponents and show the boxers from the side. Players can move left or right in the ring to avoid punches. Other moves including blocking, and left and right punches that can be varied into jabs and crosses. Matches can last up to ten rounds and when no regular or technical knock-out occurs, the winner is based on the jury's points, provided between the rounds. During knock-out phases, no buttons need to be pressed to get the boxer back to his feet. At the start of the game, a slow or fast speed for the gameplay can be selected.

Each match the player's boxer can use three super punches. These need to be charged and then unleashed when near an opponent. It sends them straight to the back of the ring, a dangerous area as it is easy to keep punching them into the ropes. Health is slightly restored during the intermission and after each won match the player is awarded skill points to be distributed over three characteristics. Matches for two players are supported.</resource>

    <resource id="378ade0dfebac640a50399c5436ff289bac4951d" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Loosely based on the movie of the same name, Ghostbusters II sees Virgo the Carpathian appear in New York city. He captures Diana's baby and it is up to the Ghostbusters to get him back. In order to accomplish this, the Ghostbusters: Igon, Ray, Peter and Winston, must chase Virgo through the courtrooms, the sewers, the apartments, the underground and the art museum.

Ghostbusters II is a top-view action game based off of New Ghostbusters II (the second Ghostbusters II license on NES) but with enough differences to be unique. Players begin by choosing two of the four ghostbusters, who all play the exact same. The first one selected is controlled by the player directly and carries a proton pack, the second ghostbuster is follows the first and carries the ghost trap. The objective of each level is to capture a predefined number of ghosts before the timer expires. The player moves up, down, left and right. One button will fire the proton gun directly in front of the first ghostbuster, stunning any ghosts. The second button will toss the trap directly in front of the second ghostbuster, trapping any stunned ghosts. While exploring the levels, any of the 2 remaining ghostbusters (as well as the ghostbusters' accountant Louis) not currently being used will occasionally show up. Touching them will provide power-ups (and often swap with a selected Ghostbuster) including vacuum guns, instant traps and invulnerability.</resource>

The angel Tenshi has taken it upon himself to put an end to Ackman's nefarious ways, and sends an army of angels and hired assassins to take out Ackman for good. It's just as well, because Ackman was getting bored without anyone to kill.

Go Go Ackman is a scrolling platformer starring the titular Ackman. Ackman can punch and charge up a ranged wave of energy, and he can also jump on some enemies to stun them before running into them and turning them into a sliding projectile. Ackman can hold up to three bombs that can clear the screen of enemies, and can also hold a weapon, either a sword, boomerang, or pistol, but it will be lost if Ackman is hit. Levels are linear, but do allow some exploration to find weapons and items hidden off the beaten road.</resource>

You must guide your tank to the end of each stage by arranging boxes with a hook attached to the bottom of your plane, as well as by shooting enemy planes and batteries that threaten it. The tank will roll forward on its own and climb up any wall that is only a single block high -- anything taller and it will crash into it and turn around, taking damage. If your tank takes too much damage, it will be destroyed and the game is over. If you get hit, you lose a plane, and if you run out of planes, the game will also be over.

There are several special items to help you on your way, including a power hook that allows you to directly carry the tank, a bomb that can destroy all enemies on the screen, and an option that makes a second plan follow yours and mimic your actions.

The game features ten stages, as well as a 2-player cooperative mode (two planes) when played via link cable.</resource>

A video gaming company was to release Phantom, their new RPG, but the company mysteriously is destroyed. Noah, Ken, and Miki are three RPG fans that are disappointed by this. Wandering about, they stumble upon a shack with a great demon inside, battling three warriors. The warriors are defeated and the demon exits through a portal. The warriors give their souls and powers to the three RPG fans, who now must enter Phantom to save the game's world. However, they must also protect the real world from the demon.

God Medicine features standard RPG elements. The three characters can level up through battle and equip weapons and armor. Spells can be learned, as well as Maphu attacks. After the party collects Maphu gems and gains the special Maphu weapons, they can put the gems in the weapons. Each gem has a different effect depending on what character equips it. Some Maphu attacks need to be charged during battle first. The charges last even if the battle is finished. The player can save anytime, except in battle.</resource>

    <resource id="2c1f55ac6ef1e4f32e3827fbc3e74445323bb9b8" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">This interpretation of the famous giant monster from the Japanese cinematic industry takes form of a fighting game, only instead of the usual brave martial artists the players control horrifying monsters from the traditional  Toho lineage: the titular beast itself, Rodan, Anguirus, Ghidorah, and others. The game has two modes: Normal and Vs. The latter is essentially a two-player mode, which allows the players to engage in giant monster battles in a variety of scenarios. Most of the monsters, however, are locked in the Vs. mode before the player has completed the Normal mode.

The Normal mode puts the player in control of Godzilla, who has to go through five stages before reaching the final boss. Each stage has two battles against two different creatures in two different locations, from which the player has to complete only one in order to proceed to the next stage. Depending on the player's performance, points are awarded; in order to be able to compete against different final bosses, the player has to accumulate more points. If the player only has the minimum required points, only one final boss will be available.

The combat system is similar to other fighting games, with various combinations of buttons executing different moves. Naturally, the normal &amp;quot;punch-kick&amp;quot; scheme is modified to suit the monsters' shapes and biological peculiarities. For example, monsters with tails can use tail spin attacks; fire-breathing monsters have a range fire attack, etc. Most of the monsters (including Godzilla) have a move when they hold the opponent and suck its blood. </resource>

With no immediate way back, you help the people fight off the scourge named 'Bio-Haz' who is consuming this dimension with evil and destruction.

This new dimension you find yourself in is not terribly unlike the one you came from, with the exception that everyone is named after foods or food-related items and most of the monsters appear to be mutated vegetables and the like.

This RPG breaks from the normal formula in a few respects. The battle system does not use any menus, switching all commands to simple button pushes. A being attack, B for dodge, Start will run and the D-Pad is shortcuts to certain spells. The combat is also live, in the sense that if you take too long to complete your turn, your opponent will attack again.

Using a battery-backed save system, the game will automatically auto-save after every successful battle.

You have the ability to buy, sell and take care of farm animals, crops and any other supplies that you may have. You can trade with many of the town's people, and fellow farmers. If you link up a friend's Game Boy, you can trade items between players as well.

The local stores supply plenty of items to help you in your quest, at a cost, of course. And if you have the time, you can go about the town in search of a little fun away from work.

From an overhead perspective, you can explore your farming area, the local town and the Harvest Sprite tunnels, full of strange and wonderful creatures that can help or destroy your quest. There are four seasons (Summer, Autumn, Winter, Spring) and each brings with it new challenges such as keeping arm animals warm during the colder seasons, and supplying water to the crops during the warmer periods.

The GBC version includes all new characters and background sprites in full color, but is also backwards compatible with the original Game Boy version. </resource>

The setting is a hat factory, where hats are dropped down from a conveyor belt two at a time and must be stacked on one of six mannequin heads. Once five hats of the same kind have been stacked on top of each other, they fall down onto another conveyor belt below and are shipped out of the factory, rewarding the player with a cash bonus (the game keeps track of score as money, not simply points). Once you ship out enough hats out of the shop, you go up a level to the next shop. The higher shop number you get to, the more types of hats start appearing to make it more difficult for you to accomplish your task. The game ends when one of your stacks of hats reaches the top of the screen.</resource>

The game starts with a maze where the kebiishi and some aliens appear.  The aliens start moving through the maze wherever they please.  While trying to keep from getting eaten, the kebiishi digs holes where the aliens will likely travel.  If an alien comes to a finished hole, it will fall in an be trapped for a while.  While the alien is trapped in the hole, you can fill the hole to bury it.  If all aliens are buried, the round ends and you can proceed to the next round.  

The Game Boy version includes both the original arcade version as well as an enhanced version with new graphics and original features such as a super alien that has special powers, moves to avoid holes and chases the keibiishi. Two players can play via the video link cable.  </resource>

Having more in common with Midway's Arch Rivals than any sane hockey simulation, this arena is no place for penalties, and no place for wimps. While the idea is still to somehow put the puck into the opposing team's goal, each team only has three players, there is a heavy focus on checking, and it is possible to do a &amp;quot;super shot&amp;quot; which is strong enough to send the goalie into the net along with the puck.

Available are exhibition and tournament modes for one or two players. Two players can even team up to take on the computer. The TurboGrafx-16 release also adds a four-player mode, while the Gameboy version adds a &amp;quot;shot race&amp;quot; mode where the player must get a certain number of goals as quickly as possible.</resource>

It's a short and simple game with a fun premise. The battles are done in a quiz show style, so if you don't speak Japanese you'll struggle a bit with that aspect. However, you can beat the game even if you do poorly in the battles. The overall difficulty is very low, mostly because some of your recipes (which are used as spells in this game) will basically give you infinite HP, and some battle choices will tell you the correct answers to quiz questions. Mai is cooking in the kitchen with her friends Yajama and Ojama when she receives a letter from a demon telling her that he has kidnapped her brother. Mai must explore eight different food-themed worlds and rescue eight characters in order to enter the demon king's castle and rescue her brother.</resource>

The player can select which pattern (from pyramids and hourglasses to more complex designs) from which to draw tiles as well as inputting a three letter code which offers several thousand possible combinations of the tiles within that pattern.

Rather than removing tiles in pairs on the edge of the pattern in order to access buried tiles, as is the norm in Shanghai, the player can select any tile on the board as long as it corresponds to the tile the game requests. However, points are scored based on how many other tiles surround the selected tile: A maximum of 320 points are awarded for tiles completely surrounded on all six sides by other tiles. Any tiles that aren't &amp;quot;standing&amp;quot; on at least one other tile will fall off the board causing a premature game over: players need to balance earning points by removing entrenched tiles while ensuring that no tile will fall off the table as a result of the removal.</resource>

This particular interpretation is a side-scrolling action game, in which players must hack their way past Hook's denizens through 11 levels.  These include forests, icy regions, and towns which Peter will have to jump, climb, and swim through. Magic items such as apples and pixie dust can be collected for special powers. When enemies are attacked, they simply put their hands up in surrender rather than dying, so as to make the game more child-friendly.</resource>

    <resource id="ee7a9b0adca7c88973d303507220689fa4adf36f" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">In this platformer based on the 1991 comedy/action film of the same name, the player takes on the role of Eddie Hawkins, known as &amp;quot;Hudson Hawk,&amp;quot; the world's greatest cat burglar. After ten years in prison for a robbery of a government installation gone wrong, Eddie is released, intending to go straight and retire. Unfortunately, fate has other plans.

Years ago, Leonardo Da Vinci created a machine with the intention of converting common lead into bronze for use on his commissioned sculpture of a horse. Da Vinci got the shock of his life when he found out the machine didn't convert lead to bronze... it converted it to gold. Knowing the ramifications of what the machine could do, Da Vinci broke the crystal that powered it into three pieces and hid them in three of his works: a miniature sculpture of a horse called the Sforza, his sketchbook and notebook called the Codex, and a miniature model of his helicopter design, hoping that they would never again see the light of day.

Unfortunately, ultra-rich psychotic yuppies Darwin and Minerva Mayflower have found out about the machine and own one piece of the crystal. Planning to flood the market with gold and crush the global economy, they need the remaining crystal pieces and require Eddie's services. To force him to comply, they kidnap his best friend and partner Tommy &amp;quot;Five-Tone&amp;quot; Messina and threaten to have him killed unless Eddie fetches them. With no choice, Eddie will have to do the jobs, save his friend, and put an end to the Mayflowers' plot.

From Rutherford's Auction House in New York, to the Vatican, and finally Castle Da Vinci in Italy, Eddie will have to dodge an odd assortment of enemies, from security guards and guard dogs, to janitors, crazed nuns, balloon-riding henchmen, paparazzi, and kids on bikes. Hawk's sole tool of the trade, aside from a wicked punch, is a baseball, of which he has an infinite supply. He'll use this to subdue enemies, distract guard dogs, and trigger switches. Eddie can also crawl to avoid shots and the occasional security beam. There's also ropes and pipes to shimmy across to avoid traps, and boxes to push and stack to reach those out of reach areas.</resource>

This is the second release in a series of mini-games, based on the TV-show, here loosely strung together to make a package. The same four games were later re-released as Hugo Classic 4.

The four minigames in this package are:Snowboard: A winter game. Hugo climbs a mountain when the witch blows up a bomb causing an avalanche. Hugo rides a snowboard downhill, avoiding large snowballs and evil snowmen blocking his way. There is also path choices to make, by looking at a map, to avoid being caught by the avalanche.

Nimbus: here Hugo rides around a mountain on a Danish vintage motorcycle brand called 'Nimbus', with the goal being the witches cave, and a treasure chest there. On the mountain path he has to avoid rocks falling from above, goats trying to push him off the path, and at the same time pick up fuel canisters and bags of coins. Again, there is a map to follow, as the path branches off along the way to other more dangerous caves.

Underjorden: Hugo explores an underground labyrinth of tunnels, slowly filling with rising water. A map is essential to find elevators and climbing ropes; in the tunnels are monsters such as dragons and jumping skulls to avoid.

Ballong: Hugo has to fly in a leaky balloon, following a map to his final goal, landing in a cave without touching the walls.Provided the player clears/avoids all obstacles, there is a short movie sequence after each mini-game showing the main story of Hugo's adventures unfolding. The game keeps a hi-score list for all games and players, shown after some idle time waiting in the main menu. There are two modes of playing difficulty, an easier TV-mode, and a more difficult Arcade mode, each of which has its own hi-score list.</resource>

It includes five levels which are directly based on mini games from the TV show. The goal is always to both survive and collect as many money bags as possible. The amount of required bags to beat a level depends on the chosen difficulty level.
Underwater snorkeling: Hugo camera is fixed behind Hugo's back and he has to dodge incoming obstacles. He also needs to regularly take new breath which is only possible if he stays in the middle of the screen.
Snowboarding: Just like in the underwater level, Hugo has to dodge incoming obstacles; just on a snowboard.
Forest: Hugo automatically moves from left to right and has to dodge obstacles by either jumping or ducking.
Ice cave: Here Hugo moves over a bottomless pit. The only way to stay alive is to stand on pillars, but those randomly rise and fall. Hugo can move in four directions.
The fifth level is unlocked after beating the other four.
The Game Boy Color version additionally has a training mode which allows to play the levels individually.</resource>

This war machine has been named the Red October. While on its trial run, the captain, Marko Ramius has hijacked the submarine along with it's crew. They plan to defect to the United States. Naturally, such a weapon must not be allowed to fall into American plans, and so orders are issued among the Soviet forces to destroy the Red October. 

You control the Red October during its run for freedom. The game plays as an underwater sidescroller. The Red October submarine can move in any of four directions. The A button fires torpedoes horizontally towards the right and the B button fires missiles vertically, upwards. Additionally, the Caterpillar drive (invisibility) may be activated for short periods of time. The player may also activate a ECM blast that will destroy all nearby offensive weapons. On the screen at all times are displays for Armor (health) and Power (fuel); should either run low, the Red October in danger of being destroyed. Power-Ups to increase or decrease the power of missiles and torpedoes may be found by destroying enemies.</resource>

Your coach leads the team in a pre-game moment of silence. The only sound heard from the locker room is the methodical dripping of a leaky shower head. Then, with intensity in his eyes, coach looks up and growls &amp;quot;Time to crash the boards!&amp;quot; The screams of 40,000 strong reverberate through the packed arena as you blast out of the tunnel and into the blinding camera light of the national media. Welcome to the only pro-style, five on five game ever to hit the hardwood!

In this conquest to be the best, you'll need to have more talent in your little fingers than the competition as you try to slam, pass, steal, free throw, jump shoot and drive the lane against eight different teams. Each with players of varying strength and weakness. The cameras will even zoom in when you go airborne for the rim rockin' slams! But you don't become a foul-happy hatchet man or the refs will have you turning the ball over more than a flapjack cook at a Pancake Emporium. Pump up the high-tech hi tops, you're jammin' with the big boys now!</resource>

The two special agents Masato Kanzaki and Mizuki Makimura receive a new important mission: destroying the ultimate weapon the enemy is developing in its secret base.

This is a top-down action game in which the player needs to find a way through a maze-like environment while shooting enemies. Sometimes there is also a key to find in order to open a closed door. Of course enemy contact should be avoided because it drains the life energy. The most important feature of the game are the two mercenaries which have different abilities (Masato is slow and has high stamina, Mizuki the opposite) and can be switched instantly.

While the basic gameplay concept is unchanged from the predecessor, there are two major differences: the characters can be moved diagonally and, besides health pick-ups, there are no power-ups anymore. The special weapons for each character can be switched in an extra menu, the weapons have unlimited ammo and the effects of the other power-ups (increasing attack range, attack power, etc.) have been incorporated into the protagonist's differences.</resource>

Or not, as this is a standard platform game with a twist of questionable taste and purpose. 

You play a crash test dummy, trying to progress through levels filled with hazards such as cars and fireballs, within the time limits. Contact with each of these loses you a limb, and once you have none left, contact means game over. Since the character isn’t handicapped by missing limbs in any way, in practical terms you can think of these as hit points  especially as there are screwdrivers to pick up which restore one limb.</resource>

In Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade you play Indy's role in his search for the Holy Grail, but this time it is you who chooses which step he will take at each part of his quest. For example, in the very beginning you receive a diary about the Grail from Indy's father, who is in Venice. At the same time, you receive a telegram from Marcus saying that the Cross of Coronado is in Portugal on a ship called Coronado, and that he'll meet Indy there. So you have to choose what you'll do first: go to Venice and check about the Grail and your father, or go to Portugal to find Marcus and the Cross of Coronado.

In the entire game you'll be prompted with these choices, each one leading to different stages throughout the game. Each stage presents different game genres. For example, in Venice you find a scrambled picture of the Grail, and you have to try to put it back together, just like you'd do with the pieces of a puzzle. Besides, in the platform stages, Indy has plenty of movements, as he can punch, kick, walk, run, jump and use his whip.

The game presents bitmapped pictures of the real movie actors, such as Harrison Ford and Sean Connery.</resource>

World League: Again using any of the A teams or Under 19 teams the player takes part in a round robin league to become world champion. The league can have as few as four or as many as thirty two teams in it, and the tournament can be a single match or a two match round robin affair. 
The International Cup: This is played between sixty four A teams which are divided into sixteen groups of four for the preliminary round. The top thirty two teams then take part in the Group League with the top sixteen taking part in the Final Tournament
The Under 23 International Cup: This is played between thirty two teams which are divided into eight groups of four for the preliminary round.

Under 23 League: 


Players can train and edit their teams, change the formations and tactics before the match. During the match they can adjust camera angles, make substitutions and tactical changes, adjust the game speed and so on. The main game element though is controlling the players, making searching passes and scoring goals.

The objective is to place all of the tiles onto the board and obtain the highest possible score by following specific rules of play.  It is a solitaire game.  There are ways to play that can dramatically increase the score, which makes the game very strategic in nature.  Additionally, when desired, the player can get an oracle reading by asking a question...the question is answered when the player makes a very elegant play (4 way match).  

There is also a &amp;quot;construction set&amp;quot; where players can create their own tiles and backgrounds.  But the game comes with numerous tile sets and backgrounds.

Four courses are available: Jack's Greatest, Castle Pines and Desert Mountain as previously seen in Greatest 18 Holes and Muirfield Village from Unlimited. Gameplay modes are skins (for two to four players) and stroke play (for one to four players). Players can choose their golfer's gender and select from beginner and expert skill levels and different tee modes (professional, men's and women's). Besides playing the complete course, there are also practice options for a single hole, the green, and a driving range.

Playing a hole begins with a top-down overview of the hole, followed by the standard view from behind the golfer. Strokes are done with the standard three-click method: start, power, and accuracy. During play, it is possible to pull up the hole overview, look at the score card and statistics and change the weather conditions. The game also offers replays and mulligans.</resource>

The end goal is to get &amp;quot;mahjong&amp;quot; - the use of all of those tiles in various hands or melds without &amp;quot;overlapping&amp;quot; the sets. These will obviously be based on two things. First is the tile's value - whether it is &amp;quot;one&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;two&amp;quot;, whatever. With the Circle and Bamboo suits, this is easy - just count the number of figures on there! At the title screen, you have several games you can play in: 1-Player Exhibition: Basically you and the AI in a nothing-really-matters match. 2-Player Exhibition: Exhibition match involving two Game Boys connected with the link cable. ?: For some reason, this doesn't work. Presumably a link cable-based option, given by limited resources. Story Mode: Basically a series of progressively-harder mahjong matches. Mahjong Simulator: Should be pretty obvious.</resource>

    <resource id="00ce1e81a8e6816e739c6c800a0d18e1aca90184" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Jelly Boy is a gelatinous humanoid pink blob on a mission throughout some strange worlds. He travels throughout such landscapes as giant toy factories and arctic snowfields during his quest, facing down all manner of dangerous enemies and obstacles. He can jump and he can  launch a large fist from his stomach (he is a blob, after all). Further, different levels have special power-ups that allow the blob to assume different forms that are useful in specific circumstances. These include a hot air balloon (for floating up to special items), a hammer (for smashing obstructing blocks), a submarine (for more effectively navigating an undersea bonus level), a skateboard (for blazing through a level on a deadline), and a pogo stick (for extra high jumping). Not all of the power-ups are useful, though. One item turns Jelly Boy into a block so that he is unable to move for several seconds.

Jelly Boy collects musical notes in lieu of having a power meter. Being hit knocks away all of his collected notes and if he gets hit again without having any notes, he will lose a life. Jelly Boy also collects a variety of fruit throughout his quest. Accumulate enough fruit to earn extra lives. Certain types of fruit have other side effects (orange = more time on the clock, avocado = invincibility).</resource>

Shortly after Neil's people were pursued the sacred place, Prinna's queen suddenly disappeared. The child of the newborn king was also taken away by someone.

It has three skill levels,beginner, medium and advanced and lets you take practice shots against a machine from 100, 200 or 300 balls.

You can compete in the top 16 international tournaments, including the U.S. Open, the Australian Open and Wimbledon and can earn anywhere from $26,000 to $58,000.  You can also keep track of your win-loss record and earnings through a password feature.

It is very accurate when it comes to playing on different surfaces such as hard court, grass or clay, each one giving a different response on each surface.  Endorsed by tennis great Jimmy Connors.</resource>

The game was a multi system release so it fits the standard console jump/shoot/duck formula although it does add some unique twists such as wounding enemies so that they surrender and can be arrested.

The initial levels follow the plot of the movie with futuristic lawman Judge Dredd framed and sent to the Aspen penal colony from which he must escape and prove his innocence.  Following the fight at the top of the Statue of Liberty that ended the film, the game continues on with levels and characters inspired by the comic book culminating with a battle against the Dark Judges on Deadworld.</resource>

The game starts just after the T-Rex pushes the visitor's van into it's pit. You play the role of Dr. Alan Grant, so you have to find Tim and Lex, take them to the Visitor's center and get everybody out of the island. But this time it won't be half as easy as it was on the movie.

The game is split in two missions, played in two different ways. The first mission is to take Tim and Lex back to their grandfather and is (almost exclusively) played from a top-down perspective. The second mission involves getting the power back on line and returning alive, so everybody can leave the island and is played like a FPS (First Person Shooter).</resource>

Meanwhile, Biosyn Corp has sent men down the former park so the company can gain control of the park for themselves.

In this 2D shooter, Player 1 controls Dr. Alan Grant and Player 2 controls Tactical Sergeant Michael Wolfskin and alone or together you face off against the free roaming dinosaurs of the once known Jurassic Park along with the members of the Biosyn Corp.  Your player always has six weapons.  Your primary machine gun and cattle prod are unlimited and most take down both the humans and dinosaurs but some only work the dinosaurs such as the cattle prod.  Most of the levels are non linear so you must explore different pathways to complete the mission you have selected once you have once you selected either one or two player mode.

    <resource id="c90c47d9174fedcd2accee53f48836cd83df7ab5" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Prince Richard and Prince Sablé have been rivals since they were young.  When news arrives of a princess in a far-off kingdom who requires rescuing, Richard dashes off in the hopes of saving her before Sablé manages to.  Left to catch up, Sablé explores the land, and soon becomes cursed, turning into a frog whenever a strange bell is heard.  Sablé must remove the curse and rescue the princess.

Kaeru No Tame Ni Kane Wa Naru is an action-adventure game.  The game plays in two modes: a top-down view (where most exploration and battle is done), and a side-scrolling view (where more puzzle solving is done than battles).  Battling is not actually performed by the player, instead it is all automatic.  If you bump into an enemy, you will see a dust cloud appear, and the pair will scuffle, with each character's health draining.  Whoever loses all their health first loses the battle.  Sablé can increase his battle advantage by collecting heart containers (to increase his life bar), and power ups that increase statistics like power and defense.

Another feature of Kaeru No Tame Ni Kane Wa Naru is Sablé's ability to transform into a frog at certain points in the game.  This allows him to access areas that he previously could not.  The main goal of the game is to conquer a huge castle, however, sections are sealed off until you complete parts of the story, allowing you to explore it in small parts at a time.</resource>

At the start of the game the player can choose from Red Jack, Silver Jack, or Blue Jack. Red and Silver both have weapons they can find ammo for in levels (a gun and baton, respectively), and all three can do a multiple hit combo or a jumping attack. At the end of a level the Jack will be met by his vehicle which will then merge with his armor. In this form the Jack's attacks are strengthened and he can charge up an attack that hits every enemy onscreen.

There is no story told at any point in the game, so if you want to know what's going on you'll have to track down the anime.</resource>

Many fighters answer the challenge to participate, including several of Ultratech's experimental warriors.  To increase the tournament's challenge, Ultratech utilizes a technology that can create bridges between alternate dimensions, releasing a creature known as Eyedol.  Eyedol is a two-headed ancient warrior that was imprisoned along with his bitter rival, Gargos. Some warriors enter the tournament to seek glory or escape.  Other fighters are attempting to bring an end to Ultratech's corruption.  

Killer Instinct is a 2D versus fighting game that features 3D rendered sprite based graphics. Players choose from ten characters: Orchid, Cinder, Jago, Glacius, Fulgore, Riptor, Sabrewulf, Spinal, T.J. Combo, and Thunder. The game is known for its heavy combo-based fighting system, allowing players to pull off moves that land a high number of hits on their opponent, the highest being the &amp;quot;Ultra Combo&amp;quot;. The game also features combo breakers, finishing moves and stage fatalities, double energy bars, and a dance-music inspired techno soundtrack.</resource>

Once again, fighters from all over the world receive a mysterious invitation to a team-based fighting tournament. And just like last year, it appears that the notorious criminal Rugal Bernstein is behind it, apparently returning from the dead to raise havok once again...

The King of Fighters '95 introduces Kyo Kusanagi's rival Iori Yagami, and firmly places Kyo as the main character for the rest of the series. The gameplay of The King of Fighters '95 is essentially unchanged from the previous title, though it does introduce the &amp;quot;team edit&amp;quot; concept which would remain as a standard feature of the series. Using the &amp;quot;team edit&amp;quot; feature, it is possible to create a totally customized team using any of the available fighters, or use one of the default teams if you wish.</resource>

Although the protagonist appears to be a weak little marshmallow, he is actually quite powerful: he has the ability to suck up his enemies like a vacuum, and then shoot them out at other enemies.  Kirby can also swallow air and inflate himself, which allows him to fly. There are four levels in the game; no save feature is available.</resource>

This time the bridges connecting the rainbow bridges have disappeared and King Dedede is to blame as always...or is he? The evil Dark Matter has him under his control and plans to turn Dream Land into a dark world. Kirby's goal is get the fabled rainbow sword and defeat him!

Gameplay consists of a platform game. Kirby is like no other platform character of its time because he can fly with no power-ups, and he can swallow enemies and get their powers. In addition to that, Kirby can now team up with his friends: Rick the hamster, Kine the fish, and Coo the owl. Each team-up has it's advantages and disadvantages, but Kirby can still swallow enemies, making more different powers available depending on the power/friend combination.</resource>

In the game you have to help Kirby defeat King Dedede and the three bosses who each guard one of the Pinball Lands.  

The game is divided into three tables or Pinball Lands, each consisting of four screens, three ordinary screens, and a boss screen  If you fall off the bottom of the lowest one, you lose a life, unless you press A at the right moment to activate the springboard, which becomes harder each time.  Each screen has a variety of things to do.  The middle screen will give access to some sort of bonus game, where you must try to get as many points as you can, and can add to your bonus and bonus multiplier.  The bonus is added to your score when you lose a life, as in ordinary pinball.

The aim is to defeat each boss.  To get to the boss you must perform a task on the top ordinary screen.  The bosses themselves must be defeated by firing Kirby at them, but they will try to stop you, sometimes by temporarily de-activating one or both of the flippers.  If you defeat the boss on each table, you face Kind Dedede himself.</resource>

There are varying modes of play, such as Time Trial, Challenge and Story Mode, but the basic idea of play is the same: you must sandwich Star Blocks between two like Friend Blocks, either horizontally or vertically.  The Friend Blocks and any Star Blocks in-between are then removed from play.  Similar to Tetris, sets of blocks fall into the bin that contain any two of the following types:

Star Blocks: The most important block, as all of the game types rely on it. Sandwich these blocks between two Friend Blocks either horizontally or vertically, and they will be cleared.  The more stars you clear, the higher the score.

Friend Blocks: These blocks have pictures of Kirby's friends - Rick the Hamster, Kine the Fish, and Coo the Owl (all from Kirby's Dream Land 2) - on them. Match two of each to clear them from the screen.  Any Star Blocks between the two character blocks will also be cleared.</resource>

An army of cans and other foodstuffs have taken over the kitchen, and Potato must stop them! Each sprawling level is designed for both exploration and speed, as in each stage there are ten kettles of special sauce hidden around, but the game also keeps track of your fastest time on each stage.

Potato has a unique special ability to aid him: he can spin in mid-air like a certain hedgehog, and use the force to launch himself further and faster than he can run. A forward spin will launch him forward, and a backspin will launch him straight upward. This greatly aids in exploration of each stage, allowing for very long or high jumps. There are also a number of power-ups to be found, including Ice Potato and Rocket Potato.

The game is made up of a number of zones, each with six stages. At the end of each zone, Potato must face off against a food-themed boss enemy, such as a stack of plates or a giant ice cream cone.</resource>

Rather than moving falling pieces, you must move and rotate a group of pieces that is stuck together. The goal is to get the moving pieces to stick together, forming a solid square of blocks. One that is done, the square disappears and the remaining pieces collapse inward, creating more room to maneuver. If you miss a piece, it will stick to the sides of the play area and cannot be removed. The game ends when the cluster of pieces becomes so big that it cannot fit into the screen. With 16 skill levels, the degree of challenge is always appropriate. If friends want to join the action, they can via a link cable. See how long you can last in KLUSTAR.</resource>

After inspecting the field from a overhead view, the shot is performed from a separate window.

 First the player gets to choose the direction and club and then the classic &amp;quot;two click&amp;quot; system comes into play: a symbol moves on a circle and its position after pressing the button influences the drift and strength of the shot.

 It is important to consider the wind direction.</resource>

Thomas is able to move left and right, jump, duck, and punch and kick. Enemy projectiles such as knives can be kicked in the air to rebound them towards the enemy. On the top floor resides Mr. X himself. </resource>

In each division there are 20 rival racers, up to 3 of which compete in each race at a time.

The races also feature lots of local drivers (who can take crucial positions away from you and the other championship drivers), Sunday drivers going at normal speed, and police. Before each race you will be told of the quality of the locals and the likelihood of police presence.

When police are in the area, speeding beyond 110 km/h could see you branded as an offender, at which point the police will try to ram you off the road, Chase H.Q.-style. You can attempt to reach the end of the race despite this damage (which eventually hampers your speed) or simply pull over and accept a fine and the loss of race points. If the police subsequently stop you, the fine is heavier.

Each race costs money to enter and your earnings can be boosted by betting on the results with the other championship drivers. If one of you wins, each driver gives you either the amount they bet or the amount you bet, whichever is lower. If a local wins you get your stake back.

Lots of power-ups can be bought along the way, including tires, radar jammers, engine improvements and nitro boosts. To move up a division you must take the Divisional Challenge, a one-off trek through a tough section within the time limit. You buy a set of 3 passes for this, each allowing one attempt.</resource>

You are Jack Slater, an action movie hero, who takes on the ax maniac ?The Ripper?, who is holding a school under siege, and Benedict, a villain who wants to use Danny?s ticket to bring terror to the real world.

The game, based on the film of the same name, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, is very different for each platform. For most of them, the gameplay can be split up into two parts: side-scrolling fighting levels and wild car chases on the streets.</resource>

    <resource id="40542133e558e853c471085528be266006b0ada2" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">The Lawnmower Man is the game based on the 1992 movie of the same name (itself loosely based on a Stephen King short story)  starring pre-Bond fame Pierce Brosnan as Dr. Lawrence Angelo, a scientist working for Virtual Space Industries in &amp;quot;Project 5&amp;quot;, a secret research that attempts to increase the intelligence of primates using psychotropic drugs and VR training. 

With his reluctance to aim the research to military purpose, after one of the chimps escapes and shoots a guard in the process he is given a forced vacation, and while taking notes on the need for experiment with a human subject, he notices Jobe Smith (Jeff Fahey), a simpleton who makes his living on odd jobs such as mowing the grass (hence, the title role). The first experiments quickly increase Jobe's intelligence, and while after an accident Angelo stopped the experiments, The Shop, a secret agency overviewing Project 5, reinserted the drugs responsible for violent behaviour into the program and sped up the treatment. As Jobe starts to develop telekinetic powers, he starts to take revenge on those who abused him before he started the treatments, and plots to take over all computers in the world.

While the CD version of the game (PC, Mega CD) is an interactive movie, both cartridge versions are platformers, the player taking control of Dr. Angelo or Carla Parkette (mother of Jobe's best friend) in typical side-scrolling shooting action. The player can collect better weapons or data discs, which after collecting a number of them allow to morph into the Virtual Suit, which gives protection against a first hit. The player visits several locations seen in the movie, such as the gas pump and the VSI headquarters. 

The twists of the game are true-3D level connectors, based on the CG sequences of the movie, usually all involving avoiding obstacles (and the occasional shooting) at high speed in the VR world. There are four different (Virtual World, Cyber War, Cyber Run and Cyber Tube), each taking a slightly different approach (Virtual World is seen in first person, the objective being dodging obstacles such as trees and archs and reach the exit, Cyber War similar to Virtual World but with some shooting stops, Cyber Run is seen in third person and requires occasional shooting of obstacles, while Cyber Tube is a fast travel with plenty of enemies in a VR tunnel).</resource>

The more this mathematician and Game Boy player pondered his next move, the deeper he slipped into thought. His game is now known as &amp;quot;Lazlos' Leap.&amp;quot;

What a mind game! Puzzle No. 100 is the most challenging of all. Take your time as long as the batteries last.

Take your best shot at 100 mind-boggling puzzles with a checker-like play. Each puzzle displays a unique marble pattern in which you must jump and eliminate all of the marbles on the board. There is one catch...the last marble must end up in the center of the board.

A battery back-up saves two separate games and compares your score against the par set by Professor Lazlos.</resource>

In the game the player takes on the role of the legendary Prince Valiant licensed from the cartoon series of the same name which is in turn based on the comic series Prince Valiant. Prince Valiant must lead Arthur's armies against the Tyrant Cynan. The goal is to capture all his castles or defeat all his armies.

A giant over-map shows the world and is divided in tiles. Each tiles has different terrain and shows whether units or castles are present in a tile. Tiles are either white or gray depending on whether Arthur or Cynan controls it.

Characters on the map can be directly controlled after being selected. This happens in a top-down view similar to The Legend of Zelda. Characters can attack and jump. Each character has different attacks. Items can be collected and the player can move freely between tiles. Moving through tiles that are occupied by the enemy conquers those territories, but the enemy can take them back at any time by moving through them again. If two enemy units meet on the same tile, combat ensues. In real time the player must try to defeat the AI opponent. This is done through dodging his attack and trying to land a blow. To conquer a castle all enemies including those in adjacent tiles must be defeated. 

It is also possible to find and collect items in the direct control mode. Items serve as power-ups that for example make the player faster or restore health points.The player can return to a castle at any time to heal completely.

The player can select the size of the world to increase or decrease the game's length. Additionally he or she and change the difficulty of the AI player (Cynan) and select a handicap for himself. It is also possible to play against another player.</resource>

After being attacked at sea, Link's ship sinks, and he finds himself stranded on Koholint Island. He awakens to see a beautiful woman looking down at him. He soon learns the island has a giant egg on top of a mountain that the Wind Fish inhabits deep inside. Link is told to &amp;quot;awaken the wind fish and all will be answered,&amp;quot; so Link sets out on another quest.

Play is similar to the SNES game with a top down perspective. Link must go onto each of the 7 temples to retrieve a musical instrument that will help awaken the Wind Fish. Along the way, Link must search the land and uncover hidden treasures and items that will allow him to progress on his journey. With new items, he can open up new passages that will take him even farther on his quest and allow him to enter new areas that were inaccessible before. Link can attack his enemies with his sword or use items he finds during his quest to help him. Guarding every instrument is a temple boss, which must be defeated if Link is to awaken the Wind Fish.

There are two modes of play, The Fish and Raise.

The Fish: As a young boy, you must search out the fish called Guardian, the only fish in the river that can cure a disease caught by your sister, Teruyo. This mode combines RPG elements such as buying items, talking to the town's folk and searching the local river for the Guardian fish. The fishing element comes into play when you bait or lure fish at the river, in hopes to find a fish.

Raise mode allows you to purchase a fish tank and the extras, and raise a small fish. Much like the many Pokémon type games, you can feed it, keep the tank clean and raise the fish.</resource>

The Lemmings have split into 12 distinct tribes, each of which has their own landscape and their own cultural identity - they include Egyptian, Circus and Highland. However, Lemming Island is now in danger, and you must complete 10 levels for each tribe in order for them to reunite and reassemble the Talisman from the 12 pieces.

Across the 120 levels there are over 60 skills, although no more than 10 are in use on each screen. The Classic tribe has the ones form the original and is perhaps the best option for first-time players.</resource>

    <resource id="7222d4b3d936aaacc248bcebf758460d4d48ab70" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Lingo is a digital version of the TV game show of the same name. Like in the game show it is the objective to guess five letter words. You are only given the first letter.

 You get several tries and with each try the letters are marked which are correctly placed and those who appear in the word but at a different location. Within words you get to blindly draw a ball from a pool.


 There are 17 numbered balls that correspond with a numbers on a bingo card. There's a ball with a question mark that let the players pick a number at will. When the players complete a row or column they receive bonus points.


 There's also three red balls that passes the turn to the other player and three green balls. A green ball allows you to pick another ball and also when you get three green balls before the game is over you win a jackpot. The game starts with two players, but after some rounds the player with most points goes to the finale. The game is in Dutch so only features Dutch words. It contains a library of 15,000 words. There's also options for six and seven letter games. It is officially licensed by the Dutch iteration of the game show and thus includes the Dutch TV presenter François Boulangé.</resource>

His father is the current King of the Savannah and the young prince is able to frolic the lands at will; jumping on and around other subjects of this animal kingdom. When Simba's father, King Mufasa, is killed and his evil brother Scar takes over the kingdom, Simba is banished from the lands of his birthright and has to grow up fast, honing his skills, for the day of his return.

The Lion King, based on the famous Disney movie, is a platform game where you control Simba - initially as a young cub, and later as an adult lion. The plot of the game follows the plot of the movie. Each of the levels represents a part of the movie. 

As young Simba, you can fight various beasts, such as lizards, by jumping on them. You can also roar to scare some creatures into submission, though every time you roar, you have to wait for your &amp;quot;roar meter&amp;quot; to charge. 

As an adult lion, you can still roar and jump, but now you fight enemies by slashing at them with your claws (if you're skillful enough, you can also grab them and toss them off the screen). 

The game features no in-game save function, and it needs to be replayed from the beginning every time.</resource>

Somewhere on Tazmania is a Lost Valley, and in that valley nests a huge seabird, so huge that one of it's eggs could feed a family for a year! Just think of the omelette one of those could make!

Thus Taz becomes fascinated and leaves in search of one of those eggs before his Dad has even finished the story...

Taz can Jump, perform a Spinning Jump and a Spin Attack. Munch roast chickens to replenish life. Gain extra points by moving quickly through the levels - there are six stages and each stage has two rounds.

There are a few other items and pickups such as:
Spring: boings Taz up to high ledges.
Blocks: destructible.
1-UP: extra life.
Star: invulnerability. Unless you run into a bomb.

In each of the eight levels, a number of items (dinosaur eggs, computer disks or DNA samples) must be collected to finish the level. Gameplay mostly consists of running, jumping and climbing through the large platform-like levels. However, in the jungles and caves of the island, many enemies await: Both various dinosaur species, including Tyrannosaurus Rex and Velociraptor, and human enemies, employees of InGen's rival BioSyn. The player can defend himself by using kicks and punches, a pistol or a grenade launcher. Ammo and health power-ups can be found in boxes scattered around the levels.

In the game you as Lucky Luke have to arrest four Dalton brothers ? Averell, William, Jack, and Joe. On your mission you will progress from level to level shooting bad cowboys, jail-breakers, and bad Indians with your revolver; collecting bullets, dynamites, sheriff stars, and other useful items; running, jumping, ducking, and climbing. The locations vary from Forts, Towns, and Jails to Mines, Train, and Saloon with Ghosts. On every level you have to complete different submissions to progress ? either to free a Bank Director, or to collect Three Nuggets for Miner to obtain a Nitroglycerine, or to build a Totem for Apaches, etc. At the end of some levels you confront the big boss, it is often the one of Daltons.

Different arcade sequences between levels allow you to chase the Dalton brothers or train riding your faithful horse Jolly; to run away from Tornado; and to ride on the raft. 

Bonus level arcade sequences represent your wrestling challenge with Jolly, bottles shooting, or revolver's barrel roulette.

To access the one of the three certain parts of the game you may enter password.

The game was made in French/English/German/Spanish.</resource>

In order to leave it, it needs to find one energy field per level. The biggest problem is how the ship is built: two round cockpits connected with a stiff rod. One of the cockpits is always fixed while the other one can be rotated around it. By alternating between the two cockpits the ship moves around the level, but of course this makes it harder to navigate tight passages. There are useful power-ups to collect like a compass and obstacles which should not be touched. Each level has to be solved within a time limit and there is no restricted number of lives.</resource>

Lift-off: Fly your space shuttle into outer space by following the guidance arrows displayed on the screen. If you don't centre the shuttle according to the signs, your progress is slowed down and you will run out of fuel before leaving Earth's gravitation. You must also keep an eye on your compressor, since it must be constantly at a high level for the rockets to boost sufficiently. Feeding the compressor too much will deplete your fuel, though, so everything must be balanced for the lift-off to be successful.

Unlike most games in the series since 1993, this one does not include a NFL license, and thus features generic team names. The included teams, stats and schedules are however based on the 1994 NFL season.

Standard game modes include exhibition games, full seasons (including playoffs) and playoffs. Special modes include Championship playoffs - featuring 38 legendary champion teams, including Green Bay '66, San Francisco '89 and Pittsburgh '78 - and Franchise playoffs - featuring 12 'all-time' teams. Exhibition mode allows players to select from all regular, champion and franchise teams plus a regular Madden and an all-time Madden team. Game length can be set between 20, 40 and 60 minutes.

The game features a playbook of more than 80 offensive plays (including fake punts and field goals) and more than 60 defensive plays, all of which can be flipped. The game also features freely definable audibles, substitutions (quarterback and halfback only), timeouts, and game stats.

Gameplay during a game is seen from the top, with the field scrolling vertically. Players are moved via the D-pad and the Game Boy's two buttons are used for throwing the ball left or right during passing play, spinning or diving during rushing play, selecting the defender closest to the ball or tackling during defensive play, and so on.</resource>

The game is closely based on its immediate predecessor. Like the earlier game, this one is not licensed from the NFL, and features generic team names, but with teams, stats and schedules based on the 1995 NFL season. Both the new expansion teams Carolina and Jacksonville as well as rule changes like the two-point conversion are incorporated.

Game modes have been cut down from the predecessor: the only remaining ones are exhibition, season and playoffs. In addition to the 30 regular teams, there is an All-Madden team for use in exhibition games only. Most features from the predecessor make a return: selectable game length (20, 40 or 60 minutes), freely definable audibles, timeouts, and detailed stats. The playbook has been reworked, substitutions are now available for all positions and the game features quarterback speech for the first time.

Game perspective (top-down, vertically scrolling) and controls are mostly unchanged from the predecessor. When played on a Super Game Boy, the game now allows for two players to match up, for which a special bluffing mode is available. </resource>

Like earlier Game Boy titles in the franchise, Madden 97 does not feature an NFL license, so offers only generic team names. Still, teams and stats are based on the 1996 NFL season.

Game modes include Exhibition, Season, Playoffs and Sudden Death. 30 regular teams plus the traditional All-Madden team are available. Besides the usual features like selectable game length, freely definable audibles, flippable playbook, timeouts and substitutions, previously Game Gear-only features making their first appearance on the Game Boy include variable weather and injuries.</resource>

Those rows can be moved left and right (in contrast to the real game, all rows are moved at once) and turned in order to kick the ball. Players also can stop the ball and perform powerful shots which incapacitate enemy athletes (except the goalkeeper) when hit. The goal is to score more goals than the opponent; a draw results in a penalty shootout.

The game features various playing options including three different surfaces, multiplayer, a training mode without an enemy team, a spectator mode for AI matches and three difficulty levels.</resource>

Players can choose to play as either the men or woman's team of four different countries which are the United States of America, Japan, Italy, and Brazil. Players can choose to play a match consisting of either one game or of a best of three.

The gameplay involves the typical set of rules for volleyball. Players try to score points by getting the ball to land on their opponents side of the court. Typical volleyball moves are also present such as bumping the ball and spiking. The match ends when a team's score reaches a set amount of points.

Options allow the player to turn the music on or off.</resource>

There is a 2-player mode in which players must race to the finish; otherwise you're racing against the clock.</resource>

Clues are provided along the sides of the playfield grid, telling the player how many squares to fill in each row and column. With logic the player can figure out exactly which squares of the grid to fill. The thinking process is similar to solving Sudoku puzzles.

Mario's Picross (from PICture CROSSword) is Nintendo's take on Nonograms. In this game, Mario takes on the role of an archaeologist who chisels away the squares in each playfield. The result is a small picture. There are 256 different puzzles to solve, divided into four courses with increasing difficulty level.

It was initially released for the Nintendo Entertainment System in February 1992 in North America, and by Ocean Software in May 1993 in Europe. As a licensed product for the McDonald's fast food franchise, the game occasionally features the various logos and characters from McDonald's restaurant signage and television advertisements, for the purposes of plot advancement and power-ups. It stars two children who venture into the fantasy world of McDonaldland in order to return Ronald McDonald's magical bag, which has been stolen by the Hamburglar.

M.C. Kids was also released for the Commodore 64, Amiga, Atari ST, and MS-DOS, though all of these home computer versions were only sold in Europe.[1] Additionally, a different version of the game was released for the Game Boy, as McDonaldland. This version was released outside of Europe as Spot: The Cool Adventure, themed upon the Cool Spot franchise. Virgin Interactive would release another game based on the McDonald's franchise for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis called Global Gladiators that is more of a traditional side-scrolling action-adventure game.</resource>

As Mega Man, you run and jump through futuristic levels, shooting baddies with your blaster, and defeat each of Dr. Wily's Robot Masters. When you defeat them, you can take their ability as your own, which can provide an advantage against other types of evil robots.

In this Game Boy version, Mega Man must fight against Ice Man, Electric Man, Cut Man, and Fire Man. After he defeats those four he battles Quick Man, Heat Man, Bubble Man, and Flash Man. And after that, there's Dr. Wily's Space Node. That sounds like a lot, but passwords will save your progress, if you make it past certain milestones.

But it was not to be.  Dr. Wily has escaped from prison and is madder than ever, this time creating eight new Robot Masters of his own to take over the world and crush Mega Man!  Is the world doomed?

Mega Man 2 is the sequel to the NES game Mega Man. In this game, Metal Man, Air Man, Bubble Man, Quick Man, Crash Man, Flash Man, Heat Man and Wood Man are Dr. Wily's eight prize creations that have been sent to take over the world.  As Mega Man defeats these bosses, he can steal their powers and use them for himself.  Each Robot Master is weak against another's weapon, and through experimentation, Mega Man can gain the upper hand by using the weapon they're vulnerable against.

Other additions to the game include the 'E-Tank' - an item that can be used at any time to completely refill Mega Man's energy, and a Password System, which allows players to continue their game by recording which Robot Masters have been defeated and how many E-Tanks they have.  Mega Man 2 also removes the scoring system from the original game.</resource>

It's quite similar, in all respects, to other Mega Man games; however, this is the first time that you get a sidekick. It's also the first time you're allowed to slide instead of merely walking. 

Rush is your dog who helps out by offering other modes of transportation when you need it. He starts out with the 'Rush Coil' ability to launch you to the top of the screen like a springboard; later he acquires the 'Rush Jet' ability to turn into a guided, floating platform to carry you wherever you need to go; and he also gets the 'Rush Marine' ability which is a submarine that works just like the jet except underwater and with the added ability to hop around out of the water (you can actually jump while on the jet but the jet continues to hover beneath you whereas you stay inside the submarine). All of these abilities function just like boss weapons.

When you defeat the boss at the end of a level you gain his power - or at least a similar power. You may pause the game at any time and switch to any single power you have. It supplants your regular Arm Cannon with a limited - but superior - ability. The weapon ammo is displayed next to your energy meter. There are eight of these, corresponding to the eight main levels, even though there are twenty-one levels in the entire game. 

Enemies will often supply you with both energy and ammo refills. You can also collect Energy Tanks which can only be used once but will entirely restore your health. You start the game with three lives. Other features include Surprise Boxes lying around for you to find. There are infinite continues and a password feature to resume play at the beginning of any level.</resource>

All seems calm and peaceful, until...

A sudden rampage breaks out, and the cause is found to be a group of robots, led by a mysterious figure. As Dr. Light begins to investigate this rampage and attempts to find a way to stop it, he is kidnapped by the leader of the robots. Rockman hurries to save Dr. Light, but is too late...the only thing he can find at the scene is a yellow scarf...one that almost seems to belong to...Blues!?

Could Rockman's supposed brother, the strange but good-hearted Blues, be the one who kidnapped Dr. Light? Is Blues the one responsible for the rampages? With these questions racing through his mind, Rockman sets off to find Blues and get the answers he wants.

Like the other early Rockman / Mega Man games, the Playstation version was only released in Japan, as part of the Complete Works series.</resource>

The only way to free the hero is to solve the Megalit puzzles. Those puzzles consist of single rooms in which blocks of varying forms are stacked up; the goal being to have every block touch the ground. To do so, the player moves around a blob-like protagonist who can jump and push respectively pull the blocks. However, they can only fall a small height before breaking which instantly fails the level.

There are two playing modes with 30 levels each. &amp;quot;Easy mode&amp;quot; features easier puzzles and unlimited tries. &amp;quot;Quest Mode&amp;quot; introduces a time limit and more complex rooms.</resource>

When Japan is invaded by the minions of a dark lord, the shogun sets out to hire the best warriors in the land to combat the enemy. 

Players start with 5000 yen and must begin by hiring their mercenaries. The team has four slots and can be recruited from five different character types (servant, ninja, monk, samurai and mystic) in any combination (including more than one of any character). The characters differ in hiring price, starting health, weapons (amount of projectiles, speed and direction), and their special attack.

The game consists of six levels, seen from an angled top-down/side-view perspective, with the screen scrolling automatically to the right. The mercenaries must shoot hordes of enemies to get to the next level, including several bosses. The mercenaries can change their formation between four different options: a vertical line, a diamond shape, a square shape and a horizontal arrowhead formation. It is also possible to switch the character in the lead position, leading to a large variety of tactical options. The hit points of each team member are counted individually, so if one is killed the remaining ones can fight on. Besides their standard weapon, each character also has a special suicide attack, triggered by pressing both buttons at the same time. These are usually highly devastating attacks, but the monk's power actually allows the group to skip ahead through a large part of the level.

Killed enemies drop coins of 10 yen in value that disappear after a short while if not picked up. The money reserve is used in a matter of ways: between stages, new recruits can be hired to replace fallen fighters. There are also various buildings in the levels that allow the spending of money. Cafes offer various items that restore or increase health and, in some levels, can change the character class of the team leader. There is a fortune-reading at a temple which makes it possible to recruit a hidden character, and the possibility to resurrect fallen comrades at a daibutsu. Only temples don't cost money and offer healing for free.</resource>

Each robot has two basic attacks: ranged and melee; which one is used depends on how close the opponent is. In each scenario, the player can control the attacks of the robot: when in ranged mode the used weapon system is chosen (each of the four body parts has its own) and during melee combat, the direction of the punches is controlled. 

Each successful hit gives points which decide the winner if no fighter goes down within the time limit. A knockdown is achieved by emptying the opponent's life bar. Additionally each hit (with a big bonus for winning) gives prize money which in turn is invested in upgrading the robot. The player can buy new parts for the four components (main body, legs and the individual arms) - but an upgraded robot also influences the difficulty of the next enemy. While being inside a fight, the AI can be set to take over the own robot.</resource>

The game is somewhat more a puzzle game than a plat-former. You are to get a number of keys to reach the exit, and the paths are always reached by tricking your opponents into either being shot or just stand away for you to walk past during the time you need it. Ammo is always very limited and consists of arrows and bombs, in the fashion that you on some levels use arrows and on some bombs.

The story is simple and consists of you, as Mickey Mouse, must save Minnie from an evil warlock.</resource>

    <resource id="404f18826e43cc490fd77fe91c5e011bbe24db3a" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">One day, Mickey and his friends went for a walk in a forest. They became so distracted by all the natural beauty surrounding them, they got lost. Pretty soon, they discovered a haunted castle. &amp;quot;That's the witch Yashja's castle,&amp;quot; they told each other. &amp;quot;Once you enter, you can never escape! The castle is full of tricks and traps and even magic wands to create ice and fire. Let's not get any closer!&amp;quot;

All this chatter aroused Yashja from her slumber. &amp;quot;So! Who dares disturb my sleep?&amp;quot; she yelled. &amp;quot;You all shall pay!&amp;quot; Suddenly, a gaping hole opened up under Mickey's friends and they all fell in. Now Mickey has to save his friends, who are now being held captive by the witch!

To save his friends, Mickey has to collect puzzle pieces that completes images of his Disney friends, including Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck, Goofy and even obscure characters like Grandma Duck from the comic book series. To do this, Mickey has to wave his wand over crystals which conceal not only pieces of the image, but also items and even an occasional enemy. Each big level has ten small stages, each with at least one image to complete. Each tenth stage has an end boss to defeat. Also, the image to complete in the tenth stage of each level reveals the Disney character being held captive by the end boss of that level.</resource>

    <resource id="c8802d1e5c6664b2cdae5bb894268e38746de2da" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">One night, as Mickey (or Minnie) lay in bed reading a book of fairy tales, he started to wonder how it would be to live in a far off land, in a magic castle. As he fell asleep, he woke up in the Kingdom of Beanwick, which is constantly tormented by earthquakes. Then, he offers his help to solve the mystery behind those earthquakes.

Mickey's Ultimate Challenge is a puzzle game in which the player chooses either Mickey or Minnie to play with. They'll find five characters from the Disney's universe in the kingdom, and will be prompted to help them in several tasks.

Each task is a different puzzle, given by a specific character. Daisy, for instance, will ask help to clean the castle's paintings hanging on a wall. The task is in fact a memory game, where Mickey or Minnie must clean the pictures matching pairs. After completing one task, they'll receive a gift.

After completing all tasks, Mickey or Minnie must trade the gifts they won with the right characters. For instance, after finishing Goofy's task, they will receive his hammer. The player must then guess who among the other characters would like to receive that hammer.

Giving the right items to the right characters will allow Mickey or Minnie access to the last puzzle and character.</resource>

It involves racing miniatures representing particular vehicle types across a particular terrain found around the house. The Sports Cars race on the desktop, 4x4s in the sandpit, Formula 1 cars on a snooker table, and so on.

These levels were packed with variation. The Snooker tables has the track painted on, although this is open to deviation (as are most levels), and had you racing through the pockets and across the rim of the table. Tanks raced as well, with the chance of shooting out your opponent if they got directly in front of you. The desktop levels include binders to jump across, pencil-sharpeners to avoid, and lots of visual jokes in the open homework.</resource>

There are six different levels to play in each with their own standard obstacles and enemies, mid-level bosses and of course end bosses that range from Mordant, Lord Zedd to Ivan Ooze himself. There are no weapons that can be used, instead the player must rely on kicks and punches to dispatch enemies and pick up health items left behind.

Additionally, the Yellow, Black, Pink Rangers are extremely fast and can jump into higher areas but are more weaker than Blue, Red, White Rangers who are much stronger, but lack the speed and jumping abilities of the other Rangers. Players can refill their health by picking up heart icons and power icons to increase their morphing meter. Once filled, the morphing meter will increase the Rangers power, attack capabilities, speed and jumping abilities.</resource>

As you walk over floor sections in the mine, the floor will change color. When all of the floor sections have been changed in color, you can move on to the next, more challenging level. To reach all of the floor sections, you will need to figure out how to get there.

You can jump (be careful not to fall too far though, or you will be squished), climb up and down ladders, and use different transportation devices that can be found on the levels (such as an elevator, slides, a springboard, or a cannon). Wandering around the mine are numerous radioactive creatures which get in Bounty Bob's way. Also scattered throughout the mines are various artifacts left behind; if Bounty Bob collects one of these, the creatures will temporarily become vulnerable. If Bounty Bob runs into one of the creatures in this state the creature will be destroyed, but if he runs into a creature while it is glowing Bounty Bob will be destroyed.

There is a total of ten different levels, and to complete them all you will need quick reflexes as well as to figure out a unique strategy for each level.</resource>

Up to 4 players can either play a game or practice any hole on any course. Each course offers its own difficulty level. Deluxe and Challenge have difficult hills and course layouts. The Challenge being the more difficult course. The Classic offers animated bridges and other obstacles. The traditional is your standard miniature golf course which requires well placed bank shots.

To make a shot, using the joystick, move the crosshair in the approximate direction and distance where you wish the ball to go. When you are ready to shoot, hit the fire button. You will notice the level rise in the power bar. When the bar reaches the desired distance, press the fire button again. When you release the fire button, the bar starts to move back down. The mark where you stopped the bar moving indicates the power with which you hit the ball. When the bar reaches the bottom of the power bar, it moves horizontally on the accuracy bar. In the middle of the accuracy bar is the center line. Too much to the left of center, it pulls to the left. Too much to the right of center, it pulls to the right. Press the fire button at the right moment to hit the ball. If the course proves to be too tough, visit the Practice course option. Not all of us can be a pro.

It's up to you to help Muddy solve the many puzzles of Jinbei Land.  Snatch all of Jinbei's cabbages in every level, and if you get stuck, dig underground and create your own secret underground paths.  A word of warning, however - Jinbei has got his best goons guarding your family, so you'd better watch out!

Mole Mania plays from an overhead perspective.  Although in each room you have to destroy all the foes to progress, the game is much more puzzle-oriented than it is towards action.  It is quite common in later levels to get yourself 'stuck', which can be fixed by leaving and returning to the screen to reset the puzzle.  One of the game's clever 'hooks' is that players can dig underground in each stage to find a completely different map than they do above ground, which can be used to get through otherwise impassable terrain.

The game also features a two player mode, where one player is Muddy, and the other is Jinbei.  Muddy must swipe as many cabbages as possible, and Jinbei must stop him.  At the end of the round, players swap roles, and then the player who got the most cabbages wins.</resource>

Max, a monster rock musician decides to fight back. In order to defeat the evil monarch, he enlists in the training course at the Mega Hero Academy.

Monster Max is a surreal isometric adventure by the same duo that created the 8-bit classic Head Over Heels. Not surprisingly it is very similar to that game in terms of control and general design, and almost identical graphically. The character moves on a bizarre landscape, where he has to collect and use objects (with either the A or B button) to accomplish mission objectives. The game starts on a training academy that serves as the mission hub. Each mission has as an entrance with a terminal and a door. By touching the terminal with the character, the mission objective and reward is displayed on the screen. The missions available can be played in any order, but Max has to pay a fee to access other levels with more advanced missions. On the top left of the screen there is a counter for the lucky stars collected. Lucky stars allow the character to touch dangerous objects once without suffering damage. Besides that are several hearts representing the number of lives. On the top right is the inventory display, showing the two objects assigned to the buttons. Hitting START while on a mission brings up a map, while pressing SELECT displays a menu with options and the password at the bottom of the screen.


The game is far larger than previous isometric adventures like Knight Lore, with over 600 more detailed locations (the double of Head Over Heels). There is a password system to save progress.</resource>

One day Max's plane crashes on an uncharted, deserted island. Max discovers ancient ruins there and ventures to explore them, attempting to connect the mystery of the past with the events of the present.

Montezuma's Return is a sequel to Montezuma's Revenge, and also focuses on platforming gameplay which includes puzzle-solving, avoiding obstacles, and fighting enemies. Unlike its predecessor, it is a first-person 3D game. The player is able to see the protagonist's feet when moving the camera, to facilitate precise platform jumping.

Every level ends with a boss battle, and each boss must be defeated in a specific way. Max can punch and kick enemies, and also use environmental hazards to damage them; pushing enemies into water or luring them into traps will kill them. Some areas require Max to jump on moving platforms, climb ropes, swim, avoid falling into lava or deadly spikes, etc. Max can collect treasure on each level, bananas or watermelon slices to heal himself, and special items to unlock barriers.

The full version of Montezuma's Revenge is included on the CD.</resource>

Shang was accompanied by Prince Goro, a warrior of the Shokan race (a four armed half-human/half-dragon). Knowing that if ten tournaments in a row were won by the Outworld champion, the Earth Realm would be conquered by evil and fall into darkness, Shang entered Goro in the tournament and had him defeat the great Kung Lao. Goro has been  reigning supreme as the undefeated fighting champion for five hundred years now. As the last tournament required draws near, Raiden, Thunder God and protector of the Earth Realm, enacts a plan to tip the scales in the humans favor, Seven fighters step into the arena on Shang Tsung's mysterious island: Shaolin warrior Liu Kang, Special Forces operative Sonya Blade, the mercenary thug Kano, fame-seeking actor Johnny Cage, the ice wielding Lin Kuei warrior Sub-Zero and his undead adversary Scorpion, and Raiden himself.

Mortal Kombat is a side-scrolling 1 on 1 fighting game. Fighting is set as one on one kombat, allowing each player to perform a variety of punches, kicks, and special moves in order to defeat their opponent.  When the opponent faces their second round loss, the winner can perform a finishing move called a &amp;quot;Fatality&amp;quot; on the loser.  The Fatality is a move unique to each fighter that graphically kills the loser in a blood-soaked finale.

Mortal Kombat began its life as a 2-player arcade title. It is notable for its use of digitized actors to represent the game's fighters, as well as its use of copious amounts of blood during gameplay.</resource>

Shang was accompanied by Prince Goro, a warrior of the Shokan race (a four-armed half-human / half-dragon). Knowing that if ten tournaments in a row were won by the Outworld champion, the Earth Realm would be conquered by evil and fall into darkness, Shang entered Goro in the tournament and had him defeat the great Kung Lao. Goro has been reigning supreme as the undefeated fighting champion for five hundred years now. As the last tournament required draws near, Raiden, Thunder God and protector of the Earth Realm, enacts a plan to tip the scales in the humans' favor, Seven fighters step into the arena on Shang Tsung's mysterious island: Shaolin warrior Liu Kang, Special Forces operative Sonya Blade, the mercenary thug Kano, fame-seeking actor Johnny Cage, the ice-wielding Lin Kuei warrior Sub-Zero and his undead adversary Scorpion, and Raiden himself.

In order to revive his Queen Sindel, the emperor Shao Kahn used the Outworld Tournament from Mortal Kombat 2 as a diversion while his Shadow Priests revive his fallen Queen on Earth. Once enacted, the dimensional bridge between the two realms connects, allowing Kahn's extermination squads to invade and destroy Earth, and enslave the population's souls.

A small team of Raiden's &amp;quot;Chosen Warriors&amp;quot; survives the attack: Mortal Kombat champion Liu Kang and his ally Kung Lao, Special Forces agents Sonya Blade and Jax, the shaman Nightwolf, the riot cop Stryker, the nomadic Kabal, and former Lin Kuei warrior Sub-Zero, who has gone rogue from his clan. Facing the warriors are the mercenary Kano, cyber-ninjas Smoke, Sektor and Cyrax, Sheeva, a female Shokan, the sorcerer Shang Tsung, and Queen Sindel herself.

Mortal Kombat 3 brings new elements to the 2D fighting series: multi-level playfields, &amp;quot;Dial-A-Combo&amp;quot; attacks, a &amp;quot;Run&amp;quot; button to speed up the battles, and &amp;quot;Vs.&amp;quot; codes, which unlock new powers and abilities once both players enter a code sequence in pre-match-up screens. Also included are more stage fatalities and finishing moves as each warrior attempts to go one-on-one with the Centaurian enforcer Motaro, and Shao Kahn himself.

Mortal Kombat 3 is the last traditional one-on-one fighting game game in the series to feature motion-captured digitized graphics for its kombatants, and introduces online network play to the PC version.</resource>

The action is one-on-one as before, and famed for its high level of violence and blood (other than the sanitised Nintendo version). There are 5 difficulty levels and optional credits, as well as the usual two player mode including same character duels.

To win the main tournament, the player must beat each of the other human players, before taking on Shang Tsung, Kintaro and finally Shao Kahn. Players have a range of punches and kicks available, as well as flying kicks, uppercuts, roundhouses, and the special moves, which vary for each player. These include throws, uppercuts, long-distance bullets, bicycle kicks and a teleport feature.</resource>

You maneuver your rider through many jumps, loops, and mud hazards to achieve a record time.

The main game is a solo affair. You attempt to complete the course before time runs out. You can also race one-on-one against the computer or against a friend via the link cable.</resource>

Unfortunately she is located in the penthouse of a hotel and Maxie is in the cellar. The goal is to reach said penthouse by solving a number of levels by finding the exit. Those levels are side-scrolling in nature, but there is also some vertical movement involved. Regarding gameplay, there are no specialities: the player jumps over platforms and dodges traps and enemies in order to avoid losing life energy. Getting hit too often results in losing a life. The only way to destroy enemies is to hit them with Maxie's tail and power ups grant either an extra life, a tail upgrade (range) or bonus points.</resource>

Help him eat his favorite snack, the delectable peach, by using laser emitting bowls to trap enemies and making them safe to chomp up.   As Mr. Chin, you can drop bowls on the ground with the B Button.  If you place one bowl on the left and one on the right, a laser will fire between the two bowls, and any enemies will be caught between, transforming into peaches.  Mr. Chin can then gobble up the peaches - if he grabs more in a row, their value increases (Mr. Chin's score is measured in calories).  When Mr. Chin eats all the enemies on-screen, more quickly take their place.  Gobble them all up, and when there are no more enemies in the level, you can progress to the next one.

Enemies in the levels can walk on thin line paths, but Mr. Chin will fall through these - he can only walk on bricks.  Mr. Chin can also smash the bricks by punching them from underneath - sometimes this will reveal a power up, such as invincibility and the ability to turn all foes into peaches instantly.</resource>

However, there are numerous bad guys out to get him! Mr. Do can defend himself from the badguys in two ways: first he can push the apples located throughout the playfield on top of the enemies and crush them. Secondly, Mr. Do is armed with a power ball. This can be thrown to destroy an enemy. Mr. Do has only one power ball, though, so he will need to wait for it to return to him before it can be used again. From time to time an alpha monster will appear on the screen bearing one of the letters in EXTRA. If you use the power ball to destroy an alpha monster you earn that letter; when you've earned the complete word EXTRA you receive an extra life. When you successfully collect all of the cherries, you will move on to the next, more difficult level.

The mobile version of the game includes the original arcade version, as well as an enhanced mode with new levels, power-ups and graphics.</resource>

This sequel continued on the &amp;quot;eat the dots/avoid the ghosts&amp;quot; gameplay of the original game, but added new features to keep the title fresh.

Like her boyfriend, Ms. Pac-Man attempts to clear four various and challenging mazes filled with dots and ever-moving bouncing fruit  while avoiding Inky, Blinky, Pinky and Sue, each with their own personalities and tactics.  One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Ms. Pac-Man.

Ms. Pac-Man can turn the tables on her pursuers by eating one of the four Energizers located within the maze. During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Ms. Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points (ranging from 200, 400, 800 and 1600, progressively). The Energizer power only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghost's eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Ms. Pac-Man again.

Survive a few rounds of gameplay, and the player will be treated to humorous intermissions showing the growing romantic relationship between Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man, leading all the way up to the arrival of &amp;quot;Junior&amp;quot;.</resource>

    <resource id="40f247a1beed37ce7df7f451343fb24a20b7cbf8" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Muhammad Ali Heavyweight Boxing, as the name implies, is a boxing game featuring the three-time World Heavyweight Champion. The game display 2D sprite-drawn boxers in a 3D ring (the so-called &amp;quot;FreeCam&amp;quot; 3D system), with the boxers moving around the ring in 360°.

One or two players can choose the number of rounds (up to 15), the round length (up to 5 minutes), the number of times a fighter must be taken down to be T.K.O. and the number of referee counts (up to 10). There are two game modes: exhibition (which can be played against the computer or one-on-one by two players) and the tournament mode (single player). Players can choose among nine fictional fighters plus Muhammad Ali himself.

There are two control types: arcade and simulation. In the arcade mode, the d-pad moves the boxer around, while the A button is used for jabs, the B button for defense and the C button for hard punches. In this mode, the game decides which of the boxer's arms will be used for each punch. In the simulation mode, the d-pad moves the player around. By holding the A button (for the left arm) or C button (for the right arm), the player can perform head jabs (by pressing up in the D pad), body jabs (by pressing down), body hooks (by pressing left) and body hooks (by pressing right). Holding the B button, the player can cover up (by pressing up), duck (by pressing down), sway left (by pressing left) and sway right (by pressing right). By pressing A and B together, the boxer performs an uppercut.

Each fighter has a power and a speed bar. As they get tired by fighting or get hurt, the bars decrease. The lower the bars, the slower or weaker the punches get, until the boxer is knocked down. By defending himself a boxer can regain power or speed. There's also a counter of punches landed at each side of the screen. If the fight ends with no winner, the judges decision is made by those numbers alone, regardless of how many times the fighters were taken down during the fight.

The game features digitized speech, including samples of Ali's voice.</resource>

To solve the mazes you must transform the items which are found in the maze into something more useful. For example, a piece of iron turns in a glass key when dropped in a pool of fire. Thus, if you want to pass a glass door, you have to find a pool of fire and a piece of iron. These transformations are not random, but sometimes require multiple stages. If you keep good notes, you'll find out all possible transformations.

The make it all a little bit more interesting, there are monsters inhibiting the maze. That problem is easily solved by transforming something into a decent weapon.</resource>

Mystical Ninja Starring Goemon is an overhead action game with light RPG elements, similar to Link's Awakening.  Players explore towns, dungeons, castles and more, searching for treasure chests and attacking enemies.  There are also shops and inns where you can purchase items or rest to recover your strength.

At the end of each level, there is a boss waiting for you.  However, to defeat them, you must compete in a mini-game called 'The Surprise Match'.  These mini-games usually feature button-mashing of some kind or a variation on a memory match game. </resource>

    <resource id="562ace7d5075f6715f89aaf90cba5971a5e56bdf" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">NBA All-Star Challenge 2 is a basketball game with six mini games, mostly based on real-life one-on-one variants. The main differences to the predecessor are the new mini game Slam Dunk (replaces H.O.R.S.E.) and slightly reworked graphics for the others. Before each game, the player can choose between 27 real-life athletes, one from each NBA team's 1991 roster. All games can be played by two players via the Game Boy link cable.

The disciplines are:
One On One: A standard one-on-one match which is restricted to the area directly before the basket. The winning condition can be set before starting the match: either scoring a certain amount of points or scoring the most within a certain time frame.

Free Throws: This mini game is about a free throw, i.e. trying to score from a fixed place without getting disturbed by an opponent. A cursor automatically moves around the basket and when the player presses the button, the athlete throws the ball to the cursor's position. The number of throws can be set before the game.

Three Point Shootout: There are five marked points around the basket; directly at the border where scoring rewards three points. The athlete stands at each point for a certain amount of time before he switches to the next point. A throwing attempt is simply performed by pressing the button twice: first for jumping and the second time for throwing the ball. This mini game is available in a training and a competitive variant.

Slam Dunk: Before each round, the player selects the performed dunk variant from a list. This mode is shown from the side, the player moves towards the basket and has to press the right button with the correct timing to score. This mode is available in a training (the game gives a few pointers for the timing) and a competitive mode.

Accuracy Shootout: Works similar to Three Point Shootout with the difference that the points are spread all over the area. The player needs to walk to the spot and, if the previous shot was missed, collect the ball from the place it bounced to. The player can either set the points manually before the mini game starts or use the random generator.

Tournament: A series of one-on-one matches in knock-out mode.</resource>

NFL Football puts the pressure on your shoulder pads to carry both the pro-style offense and defense.
When driving for the end zone, you'll call every shot, firing bullets and bombs to your favorite receivers. Or run bootlegs, blasting upfield behind snarling, thick-necked blockers.
Then on defense, chosse every attack formation and position yourself as a tenacious head banger, going the pigskin by blitzing or picking-off lame ducks.
First downs, four quarters, kickoffs, punts, field goals, extra points, stats...everything's here but the bruises. You can even star on your favorite NFL franchise, since al 28 teams are here, ready to replay their rowdy rivalries.
So pull down your face mask, tape your fingers, and grind it out on this Game Boy game breaker.</resource>

The side scrolling game, called &amp;quot;Joshua: The Lost Levels&amp;quot; on its title screen, is, as the cartridge's name implies, twenty levels for the Game Boy version of Joshua &amp; the Battle of Jericho  for one or two players that were not in the original Game Boy release.

Both word games are one player.

The first of the word games is Bible Word Match, sort of a Bible-word-themed version of the Milton Bradley board game Memory. Words are randomly selected from the Bible and hidden in pairs on the screen. Move the flashing box to a hidden word and press A. The word will be revealed. Now move to another hidden word and press A. If the two words match, you gain ten points and the words will disappear from the screen. If they do not match, you lose five points and the words will be covered again. After three correct matches in a row, a cherry will appear. Capture it to get a thirty point bonus. After five correct matches in a row, a Boom will appear. Capture it to reveal all words briefly.

The other word game is Bible Shepherd, a Bible-themed version of Hangman.  You have three sheep in a pen, the alphabet to select from and a word who's letters are hidden, showing only blank spaces. Move your cursor to a letter and press A. If the letter is not in the word, the sheep will stop moving. Select an incorrect letter again and one of the sheep will jump out of the pen. If you select a correct letter, its location(s) will be revealed in the word and, if you have sheep outside the pen, one will jump back in. You get one hundred points for each correct guessed word plus ten points for any sheep in the pen when the word is guessed correctly. If all three sheep jump from the pen before you can reveal the word, you lose.</resource>

You control a succession of the USA's elite fighters with the aim of destroying missiles held by terrorists. You must work your way through levels and find the exit to get to the next level. At the beginning and end of each level, there is a cut scene which consists of a still image with text, to progress the story of the game.

You will of course meet many more fighters throughout the level, and pick up improved weapons as the game goes on. The gameplay is fairly standard platform work, seen in many other Ocean movie tie-ins.

The Game Boy version of this game differs from the home computer version released around the same time. The level layout is different, there are no ladders ladders or ropes and you don't have to place bombs. This is possibly due to technical or game pack memory limitations of the Game Boy.</resource>

Its side-scrolling shoot'em up gameplay follows the series template closely. Players control the Vic Viper through five levels, most based on levels in earlier entries, for a kind of 'greatest hits' of the series. There is a cave level (as in level 1 of the original Gradius), the mandatory Moai stage, a Gigeresque organic level, a graveyard (similar to bonus stages in the MSX and PC Engine version of the original Gradius) and a high-tech base. Besides the classic core ship in the first level, all boss enemies are entirely new.

The cycling Gradius power-up system is reused here: collected power ups advance the power meter which can be activated at any time to gain the highlighted item. The line-up includes the classic selection of speedups, missiles, dual shots, lasers, option satellites and forcefields.

The game allows players to start in any of the five levels and even to set the number of lives to a maximum of 99.</resource>

One year later, he joined forces with the Bacterion invaders, escaped Sard, and took control of the space surrounding the planet Gradius. In 6666, the local government sends Colonel James Burton on the newest hyperspace fighter known as Metalion. The goal is clear: stop Dr. Venom and the Bacterion army before they conquer the planet.

Nemesis 2 (Gradius 2 in Japan) is a side-scrolling shoot-em-up. The gameplay is for the most part similar to that of Gradius. The player-controlled ship can alternate between three main weapons: Missile, Double, and Laser. Extra weapons such as various types of lasers, napalm missiles, reflex ring, and back beam can be collected as power-ups and equipped. In addition, special power-ups can be acquired, their effects ranging from slowing down enemies to turning the Metalion into an invincible drill-like machine for a brief amount of time. Boss battles are followed by optional mini-stages, which grant the player new weapons if completed successfully.</resource>

The game was pitched somewhere in between a full-blown simulation like F1 GP and action games like Continental Circus. Only 12 cars were in each race, which could last from between 3 and 20 laps.

Before each race you can customize wing downforce, gear ratio, tyre selection and fuel load choices – pitstops are a standard feature of the longer races. The 16-bit versions include a unique 'Improve With Mansell' mode, in which a digitized version of Nigel's head appears in the top corner of the screen, offering instructions and praise.</resource>

    <resource id="f5bc1ed9558a9cd5dc7ee351a761cd8f3604d895" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">This soccer game was made at the time when Nintendo introduced their four player adapter, and was probably made for the four playing purpose. This is shown clearly when you choose to play 2 or more players. Then you can choose between many different ground layers, like ice, grass and stone, which adds to the replayability.

When you play a one player game you play the world cup as one of the top soccer countries of that time, and you meet countries in a fixed order. Cameroon in the first match and the final is against West Germany. In an old-school fashion you lose when you play a draw, there's no extra time whatsoever.

In the game you always steer only one character, which you choose before the match starts. You can then give simple orders to you team-mates, like pass, tackle and shoot. Your moves are also limited to these moves. The game is totally lawless, so feel free to make elbow tackles without a wink from the referee. Probably it was made this way to be funnier to play against friends.</resource>

Many dreamt of conquering the land, becoming the Shogun and ruling the entire country. One of those daimyos was the ambitious Nobunaga Oda, a merciless ruler and a renowned strategist. Players take on the role of Nobunaga Oda or one of many other daimyos to try to conquer Japan.

Nobunaga's Ambition is a turn-based strategy game which can be played in different modes.  Players begin by selecting either a 17 regions scenario or a larger 50 scenario. Then, the player must select a daimyo, each of which is rated attributes in several categories; Age, Health, Ambition, Luck, Charm and IQ. As the game progresses, these values change depending on events in the game. The age value represents a time limit of sorts, as an elderly daimyo becomes increasingly likely to die of old age or sickness.</resource>

This is essentially a side-scrolling, puzzle-solving game. You will use meat to distract paramites, use rocks to destroy explosives, use hypnotic chants to control a slig (who's gun you can then use), and use levers for various tasks. Sometimes you will just sneak past an enemy or paramite.</resource>

    <resource id="af45331a6e8f4c370d6e799929c2942b24ea0812" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Olympic Summer Games is the 16-bit official videogame of the 1996 Olympic Games held in Atlanta, the third and the last IOC official title to be released on the console. A typical button masher, includes 10 events (100m sprint, 110m hurdles, pole vault, long jump, triple jump, javelin, high jump, discus, skeet and archery) and 32 countries around the world compete in custom or full Olympics, or just practice. Two players can compete head to head in the sprinting events, and a total of eight can play in the same game. Three difficulty levels allow competitive events for both rookies to veterans in the genre.

Sprinting events are a short and straight button mashing frenzy. 4 athletes compete simultaneously, the first winner advancing to the next round (two qualifiers and then the medal run). Only fast fingers and quick shotgun reaction can earn world record times. 

Jumping events are a mix of shorter button mashing bursts combined with timely pressed jumps. From the straight forward high and long jump events (run and then set the jump angle) to the more elaborate triple jump (as the name suggests, three jumps must be carefully measured for world class results) and the complex pole vault, where a strong run must be followed by a sharp pole fixation and good a release upwards. Both long jump and triple jump have a first round composed by three jumps, the better eight progress into the second round, where they are given three more jumps. In the high jump and pole vault the competition continues until all athletes miss three consecutive jumps.

The throwing events (discus and javelin) work in the same fashion as the jumping events, although trickier to pull, as the setting of the angle must be followed by a timely release. Each player is entitled to three throws, the top eight allowed three more attempts.

Finally, the shooting events. Archery is a three-round competition where the goal is to amass as many points as possible by shooting at the inner rings of the target. With six arrows per round, each shot must be calculated according to the wind, choosing between steady aim and lower tension (must be aimed upwards and compensating the wind) or higher tension but a jumpy aim (can be aimed directly at the &amp;quot;gold&amp;quot; points). Skeet is a five round competition where the goal is to hit five clay pigeons before they disappear off-screen with two slugs for each.</resource>

Each player tries to fill the game board with as many discs of his color as possible. On each turn the player places a disc on the board by selecting a location where the  opponents discs will become trapped between two of his discs. The trapped discs are flipped over to the players color. The game ends when the board is filled or time runs out, and the player with the greatest number of his color discs on the board wins. Two players can play against each other, or one player against the computer.</resource>

Each world has five opponents, and beating any three will unlock the next world. The game has passwords for continuing, which are given out between worlds. The final opponent is a god-like figure named Tamenori, named after Japanese Othello champion Hideshi Tamenori.</resource>

It features 5 courses from across Europe, and 60 top European pros, rather than the US-leaned lineup of the original. The graphics are much more detailed and colorful, as you'd expect considering the intervening years of advances in programming skill.

The control system is the standard three-click method used in most golf games, but you can now define intended draw/fade levels in advance of playing the shot, so that a perfect aim leads to a measured effect, and an imperfect one exaggerating the effect.

As well as the Stroke Play games of the original (where you count the total score across the whole round of 18 holes, and compare this to your opponent), there are also Match Play (where the aim is to win as many individual holes as possible) and Skins (the same, but with money) modes as well.</resource>

Instead of offering  several generic courses, the three available (Spyglass Hill, Sawgrass and River Highlands) are in 3D, with height differences visible (as well as the limited 3D abilities of the console allow).

The player can either chose to play as one of the 10 PGA Pros (whose swings were digitized), or go Pro - the game keeps track of statistics (longest drive, driving accuracy, best round, etc), a game (Tournament, Strokeplay, Skins, Match and Shootout), as well as a replay.

Gameplaywise, PGA 96 uses the tried-and-proved triple click system - one to start the swing, other to set strength and a final one for accuracy. It's possible to fade or draw the ball (to bend the trajectory), add backspin and pitch or chip the ball (for some medium range attempts at the hole or go above a bush).The difficulty level affects mostly the leniency of the triple click hit areas - while at novice it is possible to let the accuracy a bit off-center, in pro levels the ball goes where your swing took it - no excuses taken. However, only in Pro it is possible to make the longest drives, as the amateur and novice levels take a few yards from the total capacity of the club.</resource>

Guess his stomach is full, 'cause there's nothing much to eat here, only collecting points. This is much like some Indiana Jones adventure, only your little hero's Pac-Man instead of Harrison Ford. Pac-Man can even transform himself into a swimmer, rock eater, fireball spitter, or rope swinger during his quest.

The game takes place on a huge island separated into eight regions: Desert, Lagoon, Forest, Pyramids, Mountains, Factory, Village, and the Castle. When you manage to get through them, the last one awaits: The Machine which seems to be some sort of a way to get out of here. This level is not a typical stage after stage approach. Each screen has several exits that can either bring you closer to, or further from the end of the game.</resource>

Pac-Man's goal is continually challenged by four ghosts: The shy blue ghost Bashful (Inky), the trailing red ghost Shadow (Blinky), the fast pink ghost Speedy (Pinky), and the forgetful orange ghost Pokey (Clyde).  One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Pac-Man.

Pac-Man can turn the tables on his pursuers by eating of the four Energizers located within the maze.  During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points.  This only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghosts' eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Pac-Man again.

Survive a few rounds of gameplay, and be treated to humorous intermissions between Pac-Man and the ghosts.</resource>

The castle is divided into several rooms which have to be finished within a time limit one after another. Those rooms have varying layouts with more open spaces, tight gangways or dead ends - but every field is dirty.

 Cleaning is the simple matter of walking over a tile and if everything is clean, the level is done. However, there are also ghosts walking around the rooms which kill the player at touch.

 The protagonist has access to a few magic spells which grant advantages when used, e.g. a time stop, killing a near enemy or speed up. Each spell costs a certain amount of magic points.</resource>

Players control a small person situated near the bottom of the screen, who can only be moved to the left or right. The number of the dice the person is holding can be changed with the B button, pressing the A button will shoot the dice upwards. If the die hits another one with a matching number, the targeted dice disappears from the playing area and is added to a column at the bottom of the screen. Pressing down after lining up at least three dice of either the same number or consecutive numbers in the bottom row will destroy up to five lines at once.

There are three modes of play: The standard single player mode, which requires the player to destroy a set number of lines in order to advance to the next stage; a tournament mode in which the player has to duel a number of CPU-controlled opponents and a two player mode.</resource>

Looking for a new challenge for the Game Boy? BINGO! You've found it! Panel Action Bingo pits you against the computer or a friend (with the Game Boy Game Link) in an exciting race for time. You're the Bird, and your opponent is the Cat. You must claim one of the 25 panels in the correct order. The object: grab five panels in a row - vertically, horizontally, or diagonally - to get BINGO... before the Cat does!
Choose from one of the many game play variations: there's the Number game, the Alphabet game, and the Option function, which lets you control different aspects of the game to make it more challenging. They include:
Second 3: Your position shifts when you stay in one spot for more than 3 seconds.
Ice Stage: The play field becomes slippery, and its's tough to stop where you want!
Hide: Some of the squares on the panel are blank until you land there (but the Cat still knows what they are!)
Break: ALL the squares are blank; choose this for a test of memory as well as speed!
- 60 levels, 240 round in all, including 60 bonus rounds
- Password feature
- Pause function lets you resume the game where you left off
- Beware the Black Hole and Star squares that challenge your every move
- Hook up the Game Link for 2-player action

Pick up Panel Bingo today ... don't let that nasty Cat win!</resource>

Your goal is to destroy the balloons which bounce around the playfield. To accomplish this, you can shoot hooks which travel upwards, and blow up any balloon they touch. Depending on their size, they either split on two smaller ones, or evaporate if they're at their minimum size. Apart from balloons, some levels also have barriers that have to be destroyed with your hooks, since they often block your access to balloons. There are also some barriers which cannot ever be destroyed. Your character has the ability to climb ladders, but cannot jump. 

You can also pick up power-ups such as: the ability to fire two shots at once, the hook that attaches to the ceiling and waits 'til something bumps into it, a gun which has a high rate of fire but cannot destroy barriers. Beside extra weapons, you can also pick certain things like clock (halting time for a small period), dynamite (reducing all balls to minimum size, thus making you able to reach more points), life, and such.</resource>

Most missions require the player to take out one or multiple bogeys, without crashing. The game's style is very similar to Flight of the Intruder.</resource>

Your goal is to reveal the hidden picture inside each grid by chipping away the correct squares.  Clues along the grid's edges help you figure out which squares should be chipped away, and which should be left alone.  The puzzles are much more advanced than those in Mario's Picross - easy puzzles are in a 15x15 grid, while standard Picross puzzles are four 15x15 grids connected together, solved one section at a time.

Picross 2 has two modes of play: the first, Mario's Picross, has you solving Picross puzzles with Mario.  In this mode, the timer ticks down from 30 minutes, and you must solve the puzzle before the timer reaches zero.  If you chip away an incorrect square, you are penalized time (first two minutes, then four, then eight).

After solving a certain amount of puzzles in Mario's Picross mode, you can play Wario's Picross.  In this mode, the timer starts from zero and counts upwards.  You are not penalized time for any mistakes, however, this means that you do not know which squares are correct and which ones are incorrect until the puzzle is complete.</resource>

There are sequences of lights to activate, ramps to guide the ball through, and flippers to keep it in play. Multiball can be activated in set ways, to bring a second ball into play. The flippers are not as powerful as in previous games in the series. </resource>

    <resource id="d3f02b50476c90fcf496c512bc1aef340995f43d" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Each level of this abstract puzzler challenges the player to set up a network of pipes to allow an unspecified substance known as 'flooz' to flow through as many of those as possible. The pieces are offered in random order, and there are seven different types - straight lines going horizontally or vertically, corners rotating in each of the four directions, and cross-over pieces which carry the flooz straight across horizontally and vertically. Each of these can be entered from either side. When the flooz hits a gap, or a piece which the previous piece can't flow into, the pipe is finished.

Before the flooz starts flowing from its randomly-selected starting position, the player has several seconds to start placing pieces. They can be put down anywhere. However a situation that can often occur is there will be a long and complex piping arrangement set up, yet a gap somewhere remains to be filled. Players are able to  replace a piece with another in the same square (to make it easier to flow the flooz that way), but for a slight scoring penalty.

Bonuses are awarded for looping the flooz through both sides of at least 5 cross-over pieces, or passing the flooz through every square on the screen. Later levels have some squares on the grid blocked off, a few gaps in the side-wall (allowing flooz to thread to the other side of the screen). After every four levels there is a bonus game for points, in which the player can only place the pieces in the lowest open space in each column, similarly to the board game of &amp;quot;Connect 4&amp;quot;.</resource>

While Nintendo did not get the NFL license for this one, it did secure the license of the NFL Player's Association, so the 8 teams to choose from (all named after the appropriate NFL cities) are all stocked up with real pro players from the 1989 season. You can even substitute second-stringers for the &amp;quot;skill&amp;quot; positions (QB, RB, WR, TE, and FS/SS) when your starters get tired.

Play perspective is very unusual: top-down slightly modified with a three-quarters tilt behind the offense, and the scrolling is diagonal, from the bottom left to upper right of the screen. Each team has 12 passing and 12 running plays on offense, and the option to reverse play designs effectively gives you a total of 48 potential plays to run. The defense has 8 cover plays and 8 blitzes to select from. The kicking and punting games are handled with a fairly typical directional arrow/power meter system.

Games are divided into four 15-minute (accelerated real-time) quarters. There are no penalties, but referees do appear onscreen to signal touchdowns/field goals, take measurements on short yardage plays, and shout &amp;quot;First Down!&amp;quot; (in audio) whenever a team moves the chains. Team stats are displayed on a summary screen after every quarter of play. Highest scoring team wins, which in playoffs mode means moving on to the next round--and an eventual shot at winning it all in the Power Bowl!</resource>

The player alternates between Pocahontas and John Smith to complete seven missions. In levels one, two and four, Pocahontas needs to collect feathers for a Shaman woman to receive magic cards, travel through the forest while avoiding the spirit beat, and shake off a boy who chases her to prevent her from reaching the white man's camp respectively.

John Smith is playable in the levels three, five and six. In the third level the American explorer needs to shoot animals running and passing by, on separate planes, by aiming his gun with the mouse. He needs to shoot enough animals to feed his men before it gets dark. The objective is the same in the fifth level, but there he is in a canoe and needs to catch fish. 


In the sixth level he leaps over ravines and across rivers until he meets Pocahontas. Together, they help each other cross a lake. In the final level both characters are controlled as they need to work together to catch a bear.

Next to regular platforming mechanics such as running, climbing, jumping and swinging, there are some minor puzzle elements involving items that are selected from the bottom of the screen. That part also holds a progress bar to show how close the objectives are. Characters are generally controlled with four movement keys. The mouse cursor is visible on the screen and acts as a guide to show the possible actions. Clicking left or right offers different actions.</resource>

It was said this cloud was caused by a monster that had sealed the Sword of the Sun. Legends also says that to break the seal, a hero must collect five Power Stones that are guarded by monsters. Bomberman takes up the challenge as he is the last hero strong enough to defeat such monsters.

This is a side-scrolling platform game. In each world, you must clear four areas by killing any monsters within. To kill a monster, you drop a bomb. After a few seconds, the bomb explodes in a four-way blast. If the monster is within range of the blast, it is killed. After you clear these four areas, you must clear a fifth area by killing a boss to clear the world and collect its Power Stone.

Be careful, though, because if Bomberman is touched by a monster, touches a dangerous item or is caught in the blast of his own bomb, you lose a life. After all lives are gone, you get the option to restart that last area or quit. In most areas, you can, though the placement of bombs, find items to increase your jumping, speed, blast radius, etc.</resource>

The goal of each one-screen level (the background themes progress from the big bang all the way to the future) is simple: bouncing between platforms, collecting as many points as possible and above all the exit key which opens up the way to the next level. Of course there are various hazards to overcome, mostly in the form of special platforms like sticky or angled ones. There are also other tools to collect which can be used to make life easier at other places: water drops for extinguishing fires, a hammer for destroying walls and keys for opening up passages.</resource>

Heroes Light and Pastel decide to go out and help a young maiden bring sense back to her scientist father, who apparently has bumped his head and transformed into a evil mastermind that seeks world domination.

As the other games in the series Pop'n Twinbee is a vertically-scrolling arcade shooter in which you and a friend get behind the controls of Twinbee and Winbee, the cutest starfighters ever created, and try to clear stage after stage of enemies with your  weapons. Being a console original instead of a port, Pop'n features a number of additions to the gameplay mechanics, including an energy bar, eight difficulty levels and a handicap feature when playing with a friend (which makes most enemies target one fighter instead of the other).

The upgrade system remains consistent with the series's: you shoot colored bells which give different power-ups when collected, including multiple shots, &amp;quot;options&amp;quot; and shield energy. Also when correctly powered-up both fighters can join and perform powerful team-up moves.</resource>

The scenario is a maze and the player controls Popeye who has a time limit to collect some hearts, find Olive Oyl and save Swee'Pea which only appears somewhere to be saved after the hearts were collected and Olive found.
Popeye should avoid Bluto in order to prevent a fight with him, not losing time. When the fight is inevitable, and if Olive is already found, Popeye will lose her, and after the fight ends, he has to find her again. Bluto can drop weapons and enemies such as cannons and animals. He also steals the hearts and when it happens the heart will appear somewhere else to be collected. J. Wellington Wimpy is always wandering around and puts hamburgers that eventually block Popeye's path, however he can put so much as remove by eating them. A &amp;quot;flying&amp;quot; can of spinach will sometimes appear during the game anytime and out of nowhere, and can be used to increase Popeye's strength: be faster and the ability to eliminate enemies released by Bluto and Wimpy's hamburgers that obstruct the path. There are three playable courses and each one has five stages. In the game ending, Popeye gets married to Olive Oyl in front of a church.
Bluto is a playable character in the multiplayer-mode.</resource>

In Popeye 2, our spinach lovin' hero must once again rescue Olive Oyl and make mincemeat of Bluto while looking after Swee'Pea, feeding Wimpy and keeping an eye on Jeep.


Popeye has four different levels to traverse through. His initial adventure takes him to a construction site where bouncing springs, falling girders and open welding flames impede his progress. Rolling barrels, and bombs which must be touched to be put out also stand to cause harm. In every level scattered hamburgers must be collected in order for Popeye to get past Wimpy who is often hanging out somewhere near the top of every vertically scrolling platform level. There are also feats of strength that Popeye must perform by beating up a punching robot-type thing with the aid of Spinach. Once past all these obstacles Popeye can move on to the next level.


The second level takes Popeye into the urban jungle where he must climb the side of the Biff Spinach building and avoid the same obstacles as in the previous levels. In the third level falling girders are replaced with giant bananas as Popeye finds himself in a jungle. Coconut throwing monkeys hang from ledges and snoozing tigers and snakes decorate the trees. The fourth and final level of the game finds Popeye climbing the masts of the S.S. Trev and the S.S. Andy as he makes his way to a final confrontation with Bluto and rescue Olive Oyl.


Popeye is able to jump around and occasionally when the situation calls for it punch his way through this vertical platformer. Bonus points are rewarded for finding Swee'Pea and Jeep. He can take multiple hits before he takes a curtain call but thankfully is unharmed by long drops. The player should beware as Popeye has only one life to get through the four levels of this adventure.</resource>

To win, you must help your chosen people take over the world and wipe out the vermin who worship that other god.

Each god starts out with a single human, dumped into the middle of the wilderness.  Sometimes there is inhabitable land in sight, sometimes not.  To get a chance to win, you must change the landscape, creating flat land for your followers to build on.  The more followers you have, the more powerful you will be, so take care of them. Build as fast as you can, because the other god is doing the same.

When you have enough followers, you can make the leader of your people into a hero.  He will then go around the land you have built, literally taking strength from the people into himself, and working his way toward the enemy.  When he gets there, he will engage in holy warfare upon your enemy's people.  He will burn; he will kill.  And he won't stop until they're all dead... or he is.

But you don't have to let your people have all the fun; the gods have other tools as well.  You can drown your enemies one at a time with your land lowering powers, submerge their towns in swamps, or raise a volcano in the middle of their best farmland.  Even better, you can flood the land and drain all the people who didn't build on high ground. 

And when you win, you'll have 500 more worlds to conquer.  A god's play is just never done.</resource>

Both players choose one of five fleets which consist of combinations of eight different units. Different kinds of units have varying attributes like attack strength or range. At the start of a battle, both opponents place their units on their own half of the battlefield. Then, in each turn, they have a certain amount of moves available which can be used to move the units, scout ahead or attack. The position of enemy units is unknown until an own unit is in range and uses its radar. The goal is to completely destroy the enemy fleet. The single-player consists of playing through all eleven maps in order.</resource>

    <resource id="9bbe238298ffee569c96b256e53a679ac5161b49" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Power Racer is a conversion of the arcade game Head On that includes an extra special mode. The normal mode is a faithful recreation of the original: the playing field consists of a square race track with four lanes. Between the corners the lanes are partly interrupted so the lane can be changed. This is needed because on the uninterrupted parts there are dots which all have to be picked up to progress to the next level. There is also another (on higher levels two) car on the track which tries to crash into the player - of course this needs to be avoided. This mode features ten difficulty levels.

The special mode adds a few things to the basic playing principle. In this mode there are three difficulty levels and nine tracks which all add variations to the playing field, e.g. a different lane layout, oil slicks which cause the car to spin when driving over it or conveyor belts. There are also a few power ups which randomly appear on the track and need to be picked up within a limited time frame. Most of them are not activated instantly and can be used at a opportune time. The power ups are a bomb (causes a near enemy to spin), a level skip, an extra live, a shield, an enemy slow down and one which causes all cars to make a u-turn. This mode can be played by two human players.</resource>

    <resource id="548b7f2906fd039bc1ee5ffe7a05ff002e163c84" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">While the Sultan of Persia is fighting a war in a foreign country, his Grand Vizier Jaffar orchestrates a coup d'état. His way to the throne lies through the Sultan's lovely daughter. Jaffar kidnaps her and threatens to kill her if she refuses to marry him. Meanwhile, the man the Princess loves is thrown into the dungeon. He has only one hour to escape from his prison, defeat the guards on his way, and stop Jaffar before the terrible marriage takes place.

Prince of Persia is a 2D platformer that is commonly regarded as a progenitor of the cinematic platform genre. Rather than following the more common jump-and-run mechanics, it focuses on careful advancement through fairly complex levels, emphasizing the protagonist's vulnerability and survival aspect. Rotoscoping technique is used to give more realism to the animation of the characters' movements.

The protagonist must avoid deadly traps, solve some simple jumping and environmental puzzles (such as stepping on pressure plates to raise portcullis), and engage in sword fights with the guards. The player character has an infinite amount of lives, but has to restart at the beginning of a level each time he dies, and must complete the game within an hour. The hero starts with three units of health, which can be replenished with small health potions or permanently increased with large jars.

The Game Boy Color and SNES versions of the game feature additional levels and new enemies. The Genesis version has a new intro, an altered set of graphics and four new levels.</resource>

But he hasn't come alone. Viper's transported a battalion of battletron tanks, stealth subs, laser cannons, and annihilating androids. And he's seized a secret naval lab to develop a new breed of supreme alien being. So Scorpion stands alone against biological experiments gone bad like towering tarantulas and venomous vesty flies. His mission: level the lab before Viper transforms earth into an alien nation.

Although he may be a solo commando, Scorpion has an array of devastating weapons at his disposal like a M-90 Shell Shocker, Fire Phazer and Homing Blaster. But it will take more than sheer firepower to survive five new lethal levels of naval ports, forests, caverns and a laboratory filled with genetic mutants. You've got a snowball's chance in Haiti of making it!

But that's the way Scorpion likes it!</resource>

In this second installment, the heroine's customisation is less pronounced and it is no longer possible to move freely like in classic RPGs. 

On the other hand, the title goes deeper into the management side of things, as the player is asked to help the young girl study, direct her efforts in this or that field and ensure that her mental health and physical state are at their best. Released the same year as the first episode, Purikura Pocket 2 is only distributed in Japan.</resource>

fall down from the top into a cylinder. They can be moved left or right, rotated in either direction and made to drop faster. The goal is to get four puyos of the same color touching each other horizontally or vertically. Doing so removes them from the field. Making groups of larger than four, several at the same time or creating chain reactions nets more points. The game ends once the stacked puyos reach the top of the cylinder.

The game offers an endless single-player mode, a two-player mode (first player to fill their cylinder loses) and a mission mode. Mission mode presents the player with a number of pre-filled playing fields with a preset task, like making a minimum number of puyos disappear in one move, or removing all puyos of a certain color.</resource>

    <resource id="d85e2f875cd8a64a18b58e9fef4419c2a82ac2b5" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">The challenge in each level of Puzznic is to manoeuvre a selection of blocks into place so as to clear them all, by making them make contact with blocks of the same design. You control a cross-hair, which can move a block left or right, which can cause it to fall if there is no block under the space it would occupy.

There are many complications in terms of solving the levels. Moving platforms meaning that you need to move a block at a particular time, or in particular order, to prevent them being blockaded. In some situations there are an odd number of a certain type of block - solving these requires positioning two of the blocks one space apart, such that a move will result in a piece making contact with two others, and immediately removing all three. You will also encounter blocks positioned on platforms suspended in space and gaps in level arrangements meaning that a certain number of blocks must be in place to make a certain move possible (by forming a stack, for example).

The game structure is slightly unusual, as after you complete each batch of four levels you get a choice of two sets of levels - you are progressing through an expanding matrix of levels, which means there are two sets on level 2, three on level 3, four on level 4, and so on. This means that there are a total of 220 screens in the game. Each screen is played against a time limit, and losing a level (either by running out of time, or by making a poor move and leaving an impossible position) loses one of your three lives.</resource>

    <resource id="8159b446200fcd95150d6ba496723667c9c7047c" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">In Q Billion, you play a mouse which must level out a playfield filled with stacks of tiles. To do this, the mouse must climb onto one stack and push a taller, neighbouring stack so that tiles fall off, until there are no tiles stacked on top of each other. Oftentimes, there stacks are not adjacent to each other, which forces the mouse to push a tile next to the stack in order to have something to stand on. Since the mouse is so weak, it can only move a single tile. This calls for a lot of juggling, since in order to move a stack of three tiles (represented by a 3 in a square), it must move a single tile next to a stack of two tiles, then move another tile to the other side of the small stack and push the uppermost tile of the stack onto the single tile in order to create a stack of two next to the stack of three. If there is a distance greater than one or two squares between the stacks, it makes the task daunting and requires a lot of planning, which puts this game straight into the old style of Japanese puzzles pioneered by Sokoban.

Later stages introduce tiles of different kinds, symbolised by hearts, squares or stars. These tiles will, when moved together in groups of four, be eliminated; or at least the uppermost layer will. This calls for three-dimensional ? or even four-dimensional ? thinking on behalf of the player. None of the special tiles must be left on the screen for the stage to be cleared.

A second gaming mode contains ready-made puzzles which must be solved in a limited amount of time. An editing mode will also allow the player to create levels of his own.</resource>

The goal is to change all of the tiles on a pyramid to the target color. To do this you guide Q*bert around the pyramid, and every tile he hops on will change color. On early levels, a single hop will change the tile to the desired color, but on later levels you may need to hop on a tile multiple times or even avoid hopping on a tile multiple times! Trying to stop Q*bert are many different creatures which wander around the board, including Coily the snake, Slick and Sam, and falling balls. On the edge of the board are floating discs; if Q*bert jumps on one of these discs when the snake is in pursuit, the snake will fall off  the board while Q*bert is safely transported to the top.</resource>

Drawing the rectangles using the &amp;quot;slow&amp;quot; method awards you the most points. Once a rectangle has been made, it will be colored in to show that you have claimed your territory. While drawing the rectangles, you need to watch out for Qix (pronounced &amp;quot;kicks&amp;quot;), a series of colored lines that crawl the screen. In addition to Qix, you also need to avoid the Sparks who travel around the border, as well as any lines that you have made, as well as The Fuse, who travels along the line that you are drawing. Once you have claimed enough territory, you proceed to the next level.</resource>

You control the R-9 spaceship as it launches a last-ditch effort to repel the evil Bydo empire.

The R-9 comes equipped as standard with a small gun which can only take down the smallest of enemies without firing several shots. By holding down the fire button, it can be loaded up so as to release a large burst of energy, eliminating all but the strongest enemies in its path. From time to time, pods will come flying in your direction. Upon being shot, they release an upgrade. The first one will invariably be the one called &amp;quot;The Force&amp;quot;, which is a weapons pod that clings either to the front or the back of your ship, absorbing any enemy bullets or acting as a bumper with which you can fly head-on into them. You can also use it as an offensive weapon by firing it and pulling it back in. Mastering the Force is vital to surviving in R-Type, since it must be used both as protection against bullet clusters, as a remote controlled cannon, and in order to clear the screen from obstacles. Other upgrades give you target-seeking missiles or a bigger main gun. Different gun types, differentiated by their colour, serve different purposes. The blue one sends laser beams bouncing across the screen (good for tunnels), the red one fires straight ahead, and the yellow one follows any walls it may encounter (good for artillery emplacements).

The stages of R-Type are made in an organic style, certainly inspired by H. R. Giger's artwork for the Alien movies. When it came out, it was considered trend-setting since it broke off from the stereotypical sci-fi mould of other shoot'em'ups. In part, the levels themselves are your enemy, which is exemplified by the fourth, where spider-like creatures weave webs that cover the screen and block your path, or levels with intricate tunnel systems. Still, the levels are best handled with a combination of strategy and reflexes, without the memorisation that is required of R-Type's contemporary rival, Gradius.</resource>

If one of the two bars runs out, the race is over, but repairs are conducted during pit stops. The two playing modes for single-player are training races and a championship in which points are awarded for good end positions. Those can be reinvested into motorcycle upgrades.

The first is very recognizable, with a map to select and place the ships. Then the game is played by picking squares (e.g. A5). There are several different ships, ranging from the five-hit aircraft carriers to the two hit cruisers, even a fighter jet in later levels.

The second mode is more of a side-scrolling shooter. The player controls a submarine, trying to destroy the enemy fleet before they take the player's vessel out. Either the player takes out all the battleships causing the enemy submarine to surrender or he directly destroys the submarine to end the level.  When submerged a radar view appears, showing the player's ships along with the enemies, providing a strategic intermission to plot out the attack.</resource>

 Each of the seven fighters has a variety of punches and kills - which one gets performed depends on which directions on the d-pad are pressed. Every fighter differs from the others with two special attacks which are triggered by pressing the right button combination and a few statistics like speed or defense.

 Besides the story mode, the player can also participate in the training mode with a motionless opponent, a tournament or two-player matches. The winner of a match is whoever wins two rounds out of three.</resource>

Stimpy and I, we can't take it anymore, man! We've decided to bust out of this two-bit tube and into the real world, but we need your help! It goes like this...

First, in The Boy Who Cried Rat, Stimpy is trying his hand at being a mousecatcher... and the mouse, of course, it is I in disguise! Man, I just hope that eediot doesn't eat me by mistake..

Then, In The Army, I'm behind enemy lines, and up to my earbones in all sorts of bad guys. Jeez! Who wrote this episode, anyway?

In Stimpy's Invention, that feline friend of mine is putting together something in his crazy laboratory. Hmm... looks like a hat...

Finally, in Marooned, Space Cadet Stimpy has gotten himself lost and digested in the furthest reaches of the galaxy! Deesgusting!

Oh, yeah, everyone else is trapped in here, too: Mister Horse, Space Cabbages, Muddy Mudskipper, and even Powdered Toast Man, man! So grab those controls and get us out of here!</resource>

The HUD contains damage and energy meters along with a miniature ring up the top of the screen, useful to see the player's position in the ring so as not to get backed into a corner real easily.

Players can compete in the standard, 1-Player v. CPU, 1-Player v. 2-Player or even a career mode, where there are four preset fighters to choose from along with an option to create customers boxers. The career starts out at position #25 in the ranking and players slowly work up the ladder, going to the gym in between bouts to build up stats to eventually take on &amp;quot;Big Daddy&amp;quot; himself, Riddick Bowe.

The game is practically a copy of Evander Holyfield's Real Deal Boxing, save for the graphics style and the included fighters.</resource>

1. Gunboat Rody, a former Navy sailor
2. Spike, a giant of a man from the means streets of New York
3. Yasha, a masked Japanese wrestler
4. Shadam, a Middle Eastern grappler
5. KO Joe, a former boxer now trying his hand at professional wrestling.

Killer Cane, an unknown wrestler from Canada is faced in the championship bout of the tournament, but he is not a playable character.

There are only three modes, 1P v. CPU, 1P v. 2P (which is achieved through a cable link and an extra cartridge) and a tournament which you compete to go for the TWF (Taito Wrestling Federation) championship.</resource>

    <resource id="c7e8f00b9197dee58610b6a65788b9fcedb7d351" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Road Rash is an aggressive motorcycle racing game where the player assumes the role of a biker who takes part in a series of illegal races across the U.S.A. Starting at the back of the pack the objective is always to finish first on a linear course, overtaking the other bikers. This is achieved by driving very well or by playing it dirty, knocking opponents of their bikes using clubs, crowbars or your bare hands. The other racers fight back in a similar fashion and there are also hazards. All the races take place on the regular road with normal traffic and the cops, as well as occasional oil slicks and stray cows.

By winning races you can get promoted to a stronger division and earn cash with which you can buy a better bike. Whenever you're knocked off your bike or hit something you will have to run back to your bike and lose valuable time, plus your bike will suffer some damage.</resource>

The game offers two different racing modes. In the training mode players can practice by driving solo on any of the sixteen tracks available, with the tracks consisting of five city courses, four country courses, four mountain courses, a dirt course, and two  gymkhana courses. The main mode available is the race mode. In this mode players select the amount of races they want to compete in (5, 10, 15, or 20). After that is decided, players choose from one of six different drivers. Each driver comes with their own weight and guts percentage, and have different starting body and tire ratings for their roadster.

During a race players have to compete against five other drivers trying to get the best placed finish. While in the race, players can make pit stops to repair any tire wear or body damage they sustained while out on the track. Points are earned depending on where the player finished the race. More points are awarded for the better finish.
The ultimate champion is the driver who totals the most points after a series of races.

There is occasionally a power-up that can be picked up during a race. After the race this is collected in, this power-up can be spent on either increasing the statistics of the body or tire rating.

The game also offers the option if they want to race with the music on or off.</resource>

The major corporation there, Omni Consumer Products (OCP) saw an opportunity to sell a new kind of law enforcement officer to the troubled city. They took what was left of Murphy, encased it in titanium armor, wiped his memory and created RoboCop. Now it's up to RoboCop to clean the streets of Detroit and eliminate the one responsible for his murder, Clarence Boddicker. But it looks like Clarence might not be the kingpin of this town...

Based on the 1987 movie of the same name, RoboCop allows the player to control RoboCop. The majority of the game is a side scroller. RoboCop can punch unarmed citizens and shoot armed citizens. He can move left, right and duck but can not jump. Different weapons can be picked up from enemies, and power-ups to restore health and/or energy. Following levels, RoboCop will have to match a criminal's face to the proper mugshot and engage in a first-person shooting bonus round.

Amiga and Atari ST versions are faithful to the original level design of the Arcade game, but they also add first-person rescue hostage scenarios, and a mini-game where the player needs to match the suspects' faces

The player controls RoboCop, who, while taking care of law &amp; order in Detroit, discovers some unusual troublemakers: Terminators sent from the future. To deal with the threat, Robo will have to make his way through an OCP factory and computer complex, where a time machine awaits that will take him to the post-nuclear wasteland of future Los Angeles. There, he must destroy the Skynet mainframe to free humanity from the machines once and for all.

The game is a platforming affair. RoboCop must destroy various enemies while looking for the level exit, from various criminals in Detroit to advanced robotic probes, Terminators and flying Hunter Killers in in the OCP labs and the future. He is armed with a simple gun which can be upgraded once to a three-directional scatter shot. A single hit means the gun upgrade is lost, though. Life energy can be refilled through power-ups, and extra lives are also available.</resource>

There are 40 screens to clear, all full of baddies, who are disposed of by grabbing them with a stick, and flipping them from side to side to inflict damage. The hits needn't all be inflicted at the same time, as it's possible to release them to move them out of the way.

When killed, each bad guy releases some kind of extra, ranging from points bonuses to various devices which can be used to kill other enemies.

Each level also contains a certain amount of fruit. If you can collect all of this (with some bad guys still alive - you move on immediately once they're gone) you enter a bonus game, in which each enemy's death results in one of the letters E,X,T,R and A being released - collect them all for an invaluable extra life.

In the Game Boy version the difficulty lies slightly lower because the player can use his wand even when climbing ladders.</resource>

In  Roger Clemens' MPV Baseball players play a standard a 9 innings baseball game in Exhibition mode and a full regular season can be played including the World Championship Playoffs in the Regular Season mode. While playing in Regular Season mode the player can see their chosen team?s progress by using the in game calendar showing all the games.

Players select a fictional team from the following groups:
National Division West: San Francisco Quakes, Los Angeles Apaches, Cincinnati Big Cats, San Diego Suns, Houston Mustangs, and Atlanta Condors.

National Division East: Chicago Swords, Montreal Lumberjacks, New York Buffalos, St. Louis Commandos, Pittsburgh Panthers, and Philadelphia Generals.

American Division West: Oakland Bashers, Seattle Pioneers, Minnesota Hounds, California Waves, Texas Cowboys, Chicago Red Birds, and Kansas City Kings.

American Division East: Toronto Bears, Boston Hornets, New York Rebels, Detroit Wheels, Milwaukee Marshals, Baltimore Eagles, and Cleveland Tomahawks.Each team has a set of players the make up the team each with their own skill level and statistics which, like the teams, is fictional other then Clemens himself who is on the Boston Hornets team. 

When controlling the pitcher the player can control the speed and spin of the pitch as well as the pitchers position on the plate. The pitcher can also stop the opponent stealing a base which can be seen via windows showing the positions of all the baserunners. When controlling the batter the player has to time the hit to successfully hit the ball so it will not be a missed hit or a foul, or has the option to not hit in case of a ?ball?.  The player can also steal a base while batting. After the ball is hit the game goes into fielding mode where the camera shifts to a view that is lower than the normal 45 degree angle (the fielder gets smaller as he moves away from the camera). The player then controls the closest fielder to get or catch the ball and then throw it to the selected base. There are many different cameras angles that the game selects depending on the location of the ball. The camera can be on the left, center, or right side of the field in ether infield or outfield position and all cameras can pan to follow the ball. 

The player can use a password to save their progress in Regular Season mode. An exhibition match can be played in two player mode with the use of two controllers.   </resource>

    <resource id="41339e7cdaa256f2b5152a88a5ceab88c56c2031" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Once the people of Rolan was terrorized by the evil ruler King Barius before he was imprisoned in a castle deep within the forest. When the king many years later was released he immediately unleashed legions of regenerating monsters on the citizens of the land. Now a hero (or two if you play it in multiplayer) is needed to defeat him and his minions.

The game is an action based RPG played with an isometric perspective. As you battle your way through enemy territory you have two weapons, the sword that you start the game with and a Fire Wand that throws fireballs. You will also find some items to use, i.e. a magic axe that can be used to clear blocked passages, chamelon's ring that makes you part of the terrain and shield to help in defense.</resource>

In the game Tommy Pickles' little brother (Dil) has vanished without a trace and it is up to the Rugrats to find a replacement baby for Dil Pickles.

The game features eight levels including Pickles house, the hospital, woods, and ancient ruins. There are two levels in which you drive the Reptar Wagon in a top-down perspective, but the rest features standard side-scrolling platform gameplay. In each level the player has to collect specific items and get to the exit before time runs out.</resource>

Once a set is selected, it is removed and the remaining cells are &amp;quot;consolidated&amp;quot; (cells above fall down, cells moving to the left if there is a horizontal space).

Little does anyone know that Amakusa is really a servant of the evil Ambrosia, who had possessed and taken over Amakusa's body, as Ambrosia wishes to shroud the world into eternal darkness. Now, the player must select from out of 12 fierce warriors and plus 3 bonus characters in order to fight for the honor of defeating Amakusa once and for all, while fulfilling a specific mission for each and every warrior in the game.

The Genesis version of the game does not however include the Earthquake which has been removed due to its 16-bit memory capacity and technical size limitations.</resource>

    <resource id="df6590cd774a3daeae625bf3ef527be19dc908ca" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Scotland Yard is a faithful computer version of the popular board game of the same name, developed by Cryo in collaboration with Ravensburger (publisher of the board game):
Mr. X, a fixture on England's &amp;quot;Most Wanted&amp;quot; list, is on the run in London. Will Scotland Yard find and capture him before time runs out? 

The main map shows 199 stations in the city that can be reached by taxi, bus or underground. Each type of transportation costs a ticket.
One player takes the part of Mr. X and slinks around the city, leaving clues for the others, who are the Scotland Yard detective team. If Mr. X manages to escape capture, he/she wins. All the detectives see is which travel ticket Mr. X used during that turn. The detectives must plan movement routes to surround Mr. X and try to cut off his lines of escape. To make things difficult for the detectives, they only have a limited number of tickets, and when they run out of a ticket type, they cannot use that mode of transport anymore.


As a bonus, you can choose to play the &amp;quot;computer enhanced&amp;quot; version, which purports to add RPG elements such as money, weapons, fighting, health and conversation. 
The players can visit the stations and interact with people or locations.
Detectives have to catch criminals in order to earn money so they can buy information about Mr. X.
Mr. X has to find specific items in order to win. He can rob people or houses to earn money. Weapons, tickets and other helpful things can be bought at different locations. A lot of people offer information for a price. Only a gang boss of a district can sell Mr. X pricey information about the quest item. But to find the gang boss you need to buy information about his whereabouts first.

Overall, Scotland Yard is a game that emphasises logical deductions and strategic planning over luck. You can play either as Mr. X or detective, solo against the computer or with friends.</resource>

It is 1985, 3 years before the events of the NES game, and Jaquio has not yet been awakened. However, Emperor Garuda, an evil dictator, threatens New York city and it is up to the Ryu Hayabusa to fight him.

This game is an action side-scroller. Ryu can run, jump and beat his enemies using a sword. He also has a grappling-hook device, which can be used to reach higher platforms, which can then be hand-climbed across. By collecting power ups Ryu can use a magical technique called &amp;quot;the art of the fire wheel&amp;quot;, an ascending and spinning wheel of fire which will take more damage than his usual sword. He has up to 5 charges of this technique. Ryu has a life meter with six units, which can be replenished by finding proper power ups inside containers.

The game is divided in 5 stages. Each stages has sub-screens, and the main objective is to go from left to right till the end of the screen, destroying the enemies in the way. Among the enemies Ryu will find humans, cyborgs and machines. At the end of each stage a boss fight awaits Ryu.</resource>

The gameplay involves 144 tiles, each depicting different images, which have to be removed by matching them into pairs. The tiles are arranged in a gridded pattern, which is higher near the centre. A tile can only be removed if it has no tile next to it on at least one side.

This computer implementation can generate a random board layout to take on and features five preset challenges, some of which have time limits of five or ten minutes, as well as a multiplayer mode.</resource>

The aim of the game is to match tiles, four of each type will be put on the playing field, when two tiles are matched they are removed when none remain you win. Only tiles that can be moved freely to the left or right may be matched. A wrong move may result in you not being able to clear the field. 

A slight story mode is presented in the Shanghai mode; each tile setup is based on a Zodiac animal that needs it power restored. The goal is to complete all twelve of these stages there by restoring the animals power. 

Some variants are also included:Kong Kong: Compete against a computer to clear tiles. If you go slowly you will have tiles sent over to your by your opponent. This type of play is similar to games like Puyo Pop. Kong Kong may be played against another player by using a link cable or against a computer.

Challenge (WonderSwan only): A large Shanghai game that you'll try to race through to get the best score. 

Goldrush: In this mode you will race against an opponent to reach a tile marked 'G'. G is for GOLD, boy! So get cracking.</resource>

Once there, he must fight a succession of 11 opponents, one at a time, with gameplay resembling Street Fighter 2 or Mortal Kombat.

The game's graphics used similar rotoscoping techniques (similar to those used in Flashback or Prince of Persia) making Shaq's 7'2&amp;quot; frame is represented. As well as the story mode, the player can play individual fights, either with 1 or 2 players, although one human player must always be Shaq. Shaq can jump a huge distance, although he struggles to block.</resource>

Like most Mahjong Solitaire variants, it takes its name from a region in China: in this case, the former Imperial Palace of China, also known as The Forbidden City.

The goal of the game is to get the protagonist, who is a jiang shi by default, to the exit. To do this they must push mahjong tiles out of the way. Most mahjong tiles will disappear once they touch one or more of the same type, and these tiles will also vanish along with it. Some, like the dragon or wind tiles, are barricades that will transform any tile that comes into contact into another barricade.</resource>

It isn't going to be easy. There's nobody tougher than The Juggernauts (except maybe yours truly), but i'll be fighting 'em on my own turf: Krustyland Amusement Park, Moe's Tavern, and the Nuclear Power Plant, just to name a few.

No one knows this, but I've got a whole new set of cool manuevers AND a new technological edge - I can CHEAT!

I'm psyched. I'm ready to rock and roll. On to victory, Man!

The side-scrolling levels play similar to other Jump'N Runs, as you have to avoid obstacles and kill enemies by jumping on them. However, since you are on a skateboard, speed plays an important role, meaning that you cannot immediately stop and sometimes need to drive at full speed to manage wider jumps. The top-down levels play more similar to other Skate Or Die games as gradients influence your driving while you are trying to avoid obstacles, enemies and deadly spikes.

Instead of dealing with the toy Commandos and Gorgonites from the movie, the game uses the characters in an imaginary environment as described on the back of the toy figures' packaging.

It has fourteen levels of single-player action some featuring the Gorgonite Archer, others featuring the commando Chip Hazard. You assume the role of Archer, who has to defend his world against an invasion of the commandos. You can run, jump, climb ledges and fight using a blaster. Many levels involve freeing captured Gorgonites who then help you fight. Multiplayer includes two head-to-head two-player Chip vs. Archer mode where you either need to capture flags or get a set amount of frags.</resource>

They set off to find the 21 crystals in each area and smurf the world's rubbish in order to get back to their European village. 

So you as male Smurf or female Smurfette should travel from one continent to another. The continents represent North Pole, Africa, Asia, North America, South America, and Australia, and each of them consists of 3 levels. On each level character should collect certain number of crystal shards, which in sum gives 21 crystal shards. During the level character should collect other items to raise a score, avoid or eliminate the enemies specific for each area jumping over them, swim somewhere, or run away from cougar. 

Certain parts of the game may be accessed via password.

The game is available in French/English/Spanish/German.</resource>

It's up to Attila and Genghis to eat their way through sixteen tricky stages as they avoid nasty traps and open the exits by standing on the scales to open the exit door.

Sneaky Snakes is a pseudo-sequel to the NES game Snake, Rattle 'n Roll.  However, instead of an isometric playfield, the game is this time a standard sidescrolling platformer.  Players can play as Attila (or link up and play simultaneously with a friend as Genghis) through various devious levels.  The goal of each level is to eat enough Nibbleys (round creatures which come in assorted flavors including balloons, jellyfish, joggers, and more) to earn enough tail segments.  When your snake has enough segments, its body will flash, and you can weigh yourself to open the exit gate and progress to the next level.

Each level has a time limit of 99 seconds - if this runs out, a giant ax will appear, chasing after your snake until it eventually destroys it.  To prevent this from occurring, you can collect clocks which add another 30 seconds to your time limit.  You can also collect power ups such as increased jump height, tongue extensions, and diamonds which briefly make you invincible.</resource>

Players can also choose to play in a Knockout-style tournament where instead of a round robin type of play like in World Cup, they instead play one game and advance to the next like a regular tournament. There is also a two-player mode that allows friends to compete head-to-head.

The main gameplay is the same as others with an overhead view with a third-person perspective for penalty kicks. The rules and regulations are up to date and can actually be changed to suit the players style of choice. They can also choose weather conditions, skills of goalies or even the choice to play either indoors or outdoors. Players can also edit their players including appearance and stats wise to suit their liking.</resource>

The fruits drop down from the top in a 2x2 square which can be rotated. If the edge pieces match color, all of the fruits in the direction of the matching edge pieces will change their color to match.  Matching edge pieces can be made horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.  

Combinations can be made if the color of more than two of the same edge pieces match. Once an entire row of fruits match, it will be cleared and the fruits that didn't match will drop. However, as time played in each stage progresses, the top of the board will begin to drop.  If a fruit reaches the top of the board, the game will end.

Some game pieces that help to clear the board. Along the right side of the screen is the word &amp;quot;extra&amp;quot;.  Occasionally, a letter from that word will drop. If all of the letters are on the board, a pixie will appear to clear multiple fruits from the board.

However, some pieces hinder the ability to clear the board.  A &amp;quot;sekiero&amp;quot; piece will occasionally drop, which takes up all four spaces in the square.  In order to clear the sekiero, the entirety of both of the horizontal rows around the sekiero must match.  If a stage goes on for too long, an enemy will appear to occasionally throw bombs which change the color of the fruits and impede progress.

A stage is cleared when all of the fruits have been cleared from the board.</resource>

You can also break blocks by jumping from below them, like doing a headbutt. There are several enemies, such as fire breathing dragons, shooting gargoyles and ghosts.

Collect bells to release fairies from the exit as bonus points, and collect coins for money to spend in shops. Some rooms have a shop where you can buy items, such as fire balls or hammers.</resource>

Now, over 20 years later, a new Tank has been created based on the technology recovered during the 1978 invasion.  And none too soon, because the Invaders are back!

Space Invaders is yet another classic arcade game remake by Activision (see Battlezone  and Asteroids).  But this time, Activision licensed a game from Taito instead of Atari.  The game stays close to its roots while adding many power-ups and enemies.

You can play either one or two players against the Invaders, who march down the screen in orderly rows and columns, at one of three skill levels.  You'll start at Pluto and work your way through the Solar System to Mars, then Venus, and finally Earth.  There are four common aliens (red, green, blue, and yellow), plus seven more less common ones.  You receive special one shot power-ups by shooting four of the same type of Invaders in a row.  As in the original game, there are also Mother Ships that fly above the action, but in this version if you hit them you can pick up other useful power-ups like shields or double shots.  Plus, after fighting off several waves on each planet, you'll face a unique boss.  If you manage to finish the game, you'll be able to play a reproduction of the original coin-op.</resource>

While on his way through the forest he see's a witch in the sky and out of nowhere bricks begin to make a tower around the area Spanky is in.  The witch challenges Spanky to come to the final tower and she will free him but before she flies away she turns the fruits in his knapsack into living fruit monsters.  Unknowingly, she drops a magic ball which agrees to help Spanky out on his quest.

The object of the game is to get through all six of the towers which consist of 10 levels as well as a boss battle.  In order to proceed to the next level, you must acquire the amount of keys the locked door requires.  Keys are found lying around until a monster picks them up in which case you must use your ball on them to get it.  The ball has for different attacks: baseball, soccer ball, volleyball and basketball.  In order to attain a stronger ball, the ball must be bounced on Spankey's head.  Spanky also gets different hats which give him a specific power until he loses it or the level ends.</resource>

The player can run in the side-scrolling levels. The aim is to reach the exit without running out of lives. Lives are lost when Speedy comes into contact with dangers such as enemies, pit traps and sharp spikes.

Speedy can earn points by collecting coins. The game also borrows elements from Sonic. Speedy can run faster and even upside down in loops after running into bumpers. Speedy can also jump higher by jumping on the heads of penguins and when going fast can run through certain walls.</resource>

Unlike the first game, however, the sequel is much more open-ended (à la Grand Theft Auto: Vice City), allowing Spider-Man free reign to explore New York City and performing everyday heroics; stopping muggers, bank robberies and car-jackers to more mundane pursuits such as delivering pizzas and snapping photos for the Daily Bugle.  

However, the action becomes even more intense as not only does Spidey have to keep the streets safe in general for the citizens of Manhattan, he also has to face up against such super villains as Rhino, Shocker, Mysterio and Calypso, as well as a few entanglements with the Black Cat along the way to square off against Dr. Octopus and save New York in the process!</resource>

It features three classes of open-wheel cars (which dub as difficulty levels), three game modes (practice, single race and championship) and 25 different tracks all around the world, with some of them only playable on the according championship, from the Japanese Formula 3 to the World F1 Grand Prix. On each class, tracks become longer (forcing pit stops), cars faster, and turns change from simple, low angle corners which require no more than a slight trajectory to elbow corners which require some skill to turn without losing speed. 

Controls are simple, with the directional button steering the car and the B button used to throttle the car and A to change between high and low gear.</resource>

From the dark streets of GOTHAM CITY to the deepest corners of the criminal underground comes the CAPED CRUSADER as you've never seen him before.

Incredibly strong. Armed to the teeth. And ready to put his life on the line for the sake of all, on a search-and-destroy mission to end THE JOKER'S reign of terror. He leaps, he flies, he dodges enemy fire and delivers it right back ... with a vengeance.

This is no kid stuff. This is as real as video gaming gets. If you liked what you saw in the movie, you're gonna love what you see here. Because this time around, BATMAN is all business, and he won't let anything ... anything ... stand in his way.</resource>

To do so, he has to climb a tower consisting of many floors. There are two types of gameplay  encountered during the game: Finding the exit in a maze-like stage while shooting enemies (touching them takes away life energy and eventually leads to death) or a Soko-Ban variant. Here the player has to push blocks into certain marked positions, but they cant be pulled. In those stages the level can be reset without penalty. 
Shooting enemies awards experience points which eventually leads to a health upgrade.
The protagonist also encounters various friendly sprites who can be talked to and give hints.  </resource>

The plot of this Trek is based around a giant &amp;quot;Doomsday Machine&amp;quot; that is destroying ships, planets, and other valuable stuff in federation space. The Federation has constructed a weapon to defeat the doomsday machine, but the Klingons think that it will be used against them. So, they steal the weapon and break it up into 12 pieces spread out over 3 planets.

It is up to the crew of the Enterprise to travel to the 3 planets, recover all 12 pieces of the weapon, and finally stop the Doomsday Machine. There are two modes of game play. First, there is a side-scrolling shoot-em-up in which you pilot the Enterprise through asteroid fields and enemy fleets. Second, there is a overhead-view game in which you maneuver Captain Kirk around the planet to gather up the pieces of the weapon.

This year is a simulation of the U.S.S. Enterprise.

Star Trek: The Next Generation is divided into a series of missions. Players will start on the main screen of the bridge and from there can access Navigation, Tactical, Operations, Engineering, Transporter Systems and Mission Control. Mini-games are sometimes used to complete certain ship functions (such as rerouting power to the shields).

The game has several different playing modes. The first is starship combat: seen from the main screen of the Enterprise (both the -B or the -D version) you navigate the ship through space, firing phasers or photon torpedoes at enemies like Tholians, Klingons and Romulans. Another mode has you navigating the ship to its destination by flying through rectangles in space.

On away missions, the view switches to a top-down perspective where you control a single character and can fire your phaser at enemies.

Finally, the game has two puzzle modes. In the first one, frequencies must be decoded: this is done by putting symbols into the right order. One can only guess the order at first, but after an attempt the game reveals how many of the selected symbols are part of the combination and how many are in the right place. Using logic, the right order can be determined, but there are only a limited number of tries.

The second puzzle mode is used to reroute power from one system to another. To do so, a path must be built on a grid for the energy to flow through. The path must be built out of randomly assigned pieces that don't always fit together, similar to the concept of Pipe Mania.</resource>

As a master mariner aboard the scout ship StarHawk, you have been sent to explore the Evil Empire of Axtar. You were preprared for almost anything - anything but the rampant mutants that ingest this raging realm of never-ending combat. Half organic, half technological, the freakish life forms of Axtar have only one instinct: to attack.

Hordes of alien beasties come at you from all sides as your ship is transported from world to world through five levels. You shudder at the sight of grotesque globule-emitting eyeballs, terrifying buzzsaw-like energy disks, implacable poison jetting phenocrysts, and huge end-level bosses.

As the battle rages on, you'll need nerves of steel and lightning quick reflexes to survive!</resource>

The player has five turns in which he can move of a certain amount of tiles, place traps, stomp to frighten the cockroaches, step on them, hit them with a broom or spray them with an insecticide. Next come the cockroaches' turn, their actions being defined by precise rules. 

If the insects can escape or reach the piece of food you're meant to protect, you lose the round. Victory is achieved if all cockroaches are either destroyed or captured.

The game includes a detailed tutorial with explanations of all the game mechanics.</resource>

The player takes the role of a sumo wrestler who has to cross five levels (each with three stages plus a boss) to rescue his kidnapped girlfriend.

 The protagonist has two means of attack: his fists and a stomp attack which, in addition to the damage, can stun enemies. Experience points are awarded for killing enemies, solving hidden mini games and collecting power-ups like health refreshments or temporary invincibility. Eventually this leads to a level up and the player can choose to upgrade one of the two attacks or increase his maximum health. The mini games are sumo wrestling, arm wrestling and thumb wrestling.

 All are reaction tests in which a button has to be pressed to stop a cursor moving left and right at the correct spot.</resource>

    <resource id="85a5ff93588b9ad0901a295cfd73562d2ff896ae" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Super Black Bass is a bass fishing game where players can compete in four different lake tournaments. Player can fish in: Skywater Lake (Local Amateur), Clear Lake (Amateur), Murphy Lake (Pro) and Bluestone Lake (Super Bass), the goal of which is to catch a certain weight limit of bass before a certain time limit.

There are two screens, the boating screen where players navigate a lake using the D-Pad to navigate, the &amp;quot;A&amp;quot; button for acceleration and the &amp;quot;B&amp;quot; button for reverse.  The &amp;quot;Y&amp;quot; button is used to enter the fishing screen.  There is also a fish finder on the lower part of the screen that helps the player in locating a good place to fish.

When the player enters the &amp;quot;fishing screen&amp;quot;, they can use the &amp;quot;L &amp; R&amp;quot; shoulder buttons to increase the distance meter, the &amp;quot;X&amp;quot; button brings up the lure selection screen, the &amp;quot;B&amp;quot; button can bring an overhead view of the location the player currently has the lure set for and the &amp;quot;Y&amp;quot; button brings the player back to the &amp;quot;boat mode&amp;quot;.  To cast, the player presses the &amp;quot;A&amp;quot; button once to start the cast meter and a pressing it again when the meter is set at a certain limit to cast it.

While fishing, the player will have an overhead top-down mode of the lake, using the &amp;quot;A&amp;quot; button to reel in their lure and using the D-Pad to manipulate movement of the lure.  Fish can be seen through the water, outlined in a light color while bigger fish are seen stationary and cast in a dark shadow.  Once the player hooks the fish, a meter will show up at the bottom, showing the tension of the line, when it hits to the far right of the meter, the line will snap.  The line can also be manually cut by pressing the &amp;quot;A+B&amp;quot; buttons together.

There are eight different lures to choose from (Pencil Bait, Torpedo, Jitterbug, Frog, Crankbait, Spoon, Furry Sinker &amp; Plastic Worm) along with several different color variations to choose from and five fish to catch (Blue Gill, Rainbow Trout, Catfish, Northern Pike and the game's namesake, Bass).

There are also attributes the player can have, Technique and Strength, that can be upgraded by catching more bass and  progress can be kept through a password feature.</resource>

Your goal is to earn as many points as possible by destroying the bricks at the top of the playfield. To do this, you need to use the paddle at the bottom of the screen to keep a bouncing ball within the playfield. There are four different game variations included. The first is 'Breakout', and plays the same as the original game.</resource>

As usual, you must drive your way towards a criminal's vehicle, which is known to be involved in some crime, while avoiding passing cars to gain points. Your car also comes equipped with three turbos, which can be useful if you are way behind the vehicle.

But this time, cars aren't just the only things that you have to worry about. You will also encounter bikes that shoot or throw firebombs at you, as well as cars that go the wrong way. (If you crash into one of these, you'll be sent flying through the air.) Not to mention other obstacles such as barricades.

Furthermore, as well as the criminal's damage indicator, you also have your own. When you finally catch up with each criminal,  they are likely to shoot at you if you get too close to their vehicle, but you may encounter criminals who have different ways of attacking you. The fourth criminal, for example, launches a missile at you if you are further behind him. Once you are shot at and hit, your indicator decreases for every time you are hit, but this rule does not apply when you're hit by passing cars. When your indicator is empty or when you're out of time, the game ends.

When you complete each round, a statistics screen will appear, and you are awarded points based on the time remaining, how much damage you've done, and the number of nitros that are used. One of the options allow you to display the game's speedometer in either MPH or Km/h. The game also has a storyline, which can be viewed in between rounds.</resource>

You must run, jump, and eat fruit (can malnutrition cause a hunched back?  Can nutrition reverse it?) through a varied series of platform environments, jumping over (and atop) rolling logs that will briefly daze you if you mistime your jump and spiked pits that will, well, skewer you as surely as in the original, swinging on ropes, and signaling the end of each level by ringing an enormous bell there specifically for that purpose.  Since our pal Quasi is from Paris, not Krypton, and doesn't grow large eating mushrooms, one must conclude that it is the amusing idle animations and hidden bonus stages that lend the &amp;quot;Super&amp;quot; prefix to this game.</resource>

Although Acme Oil Co. has been destroyed by James Pond, Pond's arch enemy Dr. Maybe survived and has retreated to the North Pole where he has taken over Santa's workshop. Dr. Maybe is holding Santa's workers hostage (in most versions of the game they are penguins, in some they are elves), and has turned many of Santa's helpers into his own twisted and dangerous assistants. James Pond is recruited to infiltrate Santa's grotto, free the captive penguins, retrieve the stolen toys for the children of the world, and defeat Dr. Maybe once and for all. This time, however, due to the greater risks involved in this mission, Pond is given a robotic suit and the code name &amp;quot;RoboCod&amp;quot; (a pun on RoboCop). This suit gives Pond superhuman strength and agility as well as enabling him to stretch his midsection almost indefinitely and reach otherwise impossibly high areas.</resource>

It includes 40 teams (16 national and 24 club), along the ability to edit club team names and shirts and player names and looks. Game modes include friendlies, Domestic League and Cup  (composed by eight English teams), European League (16 European teams) and International cup (eight team tournament). Training allows to practice free kicks, penalties or to pass, shoot and dribble without opposition. 
Players can compete head to head, or play cooperatively against the computer in the same team. Other game options include player speed, wind and grass cut, along the typical half length, offside rules, extra time and difficulty setting. All changes, from team edits to options, are stored in the cartridge internal memory.

About the game itself, it was one of the most popular of the time, featuring a top-down view  with the ball not sticking to the players' feet being the most prominent gameplay feature.</resource>

Fame, glory and bikini clad women await your victories and the taste of dirt awaits if you fail. Let a computer car beat you and you lose one of your 3 credits.

Successful races bring more money, which can be used to soup up their machine. Boosts to top speed, grip and acceleration can be purchased, and your nitro boost must be kept topped up. If you are desperate for upgrades, you can buy into your spare credits.

Only your off-road driving abilities will be enough to pull you to first place in these races. Play alone or with up to 3 other players (depending on the version) in this classic arcade game.</resource>

    <resource id="57ec9014c3a7625c6f1444bed25e11bb2567bc80" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">The very first installment of the Super Robot Taisen series is quite different from all of its successors; most notably, the robots are treated as sentient organisms, and all pilots are absent from the game. As the intro tells, they live on the planet of super robots, when a mysterious space creature know as Gil Gil Gan takes control of most the planet's inhabitants and launch a destructive war.

The basic interface is like every other SRT game: your robots are placed out on a map grid with different terrain types. Placing the cursor above a robot and pushing a button brings up a menu with basic choices for movement, attack, status and special options. A similar menu is displayed if you move your robot close to an enemy unit, offering options to attack, use spiritual powers or negotiate. After all robots have moved, the turn is over, and the game switches to the enemy phase.

All robots are licensed from two parties only ? Sunrise and Dynamic ? and when starting the game you may choose to start with the Gundam team, the Mazinger team or the Getter Robo team. One robot must be designated as the team leader, which allows you to upgrade its statistics with a number of points. If the leader robot is destroyed in battle, the game is over. Unlike later games, destroyed units are not repaired after a scenario is cleared, but may show up as an enemy unit later on. This puts a lot more emphasis on the negotiation command than later games, since a lot more enemy units may in fact turn out to be friends. Few of them will listen unless you have first brought down their HP to a minimal amount, though.

Apart from HP, each unit has XP. Experience is gained for each enemy unit that is destroyed, and a level up adds to all aspects of your robot; speed, force, armor, HP and SP. SP, or spiritual power, is like MP in conventional RPGs, allowing a unit-specific set of ?spiritual commands? to be executed. These usually change game variables, such as force of attack, speed of dodging or health. Health is otherwise regenerated by putting a unit in one of the bases spread out on each map. When first entering a base, you gain a power-up item. These are fitted to your robots between scenarios and include new weapons and shields.

Each battle is displayed as a small animation, but it is all very primitive compared to later games in the series, even on the Game Boy, with little movement apart from the bullets and lasers. Preceding each battle you have initiated yourself, you may choose your weapon. Weapons may be hand-to-hand or ranged. Ranged weapons are advantageous since your opponent may not fire back ? this is true even of enemy units which possess ranged weapons of their own. All weapons have also properties for their accuracy and power, which are altered according to the terrain and whether enemies are at sea, on the ground or airborne.</resource>

Gameplay consists of standard platform action spiced up with some slightly different (gameplay-wise) sequences. Race to Jabba the Hutt's palace in a speeder, fight your way through Jabba the Hutt's minions before killing Jabba himself, control speeder bikes and the Millennium Falcon, and much more.

The great wizard Colin pledged that he and his descendants would build and protect a temple around Zakdos' prison. However, as a thief enters the temple and breaks the casket, Zakdos is set free and murders all that are left of the clan of Colin except for a young boy named Mute. To make things worse, the Sword of Hope, that has sealed away an evil dragon, is also stolen. The player takes control of Prince Theo who, with the help of Mute and other characters, must stop Zakdos and retrieve the Sword of Hope before the dragon awakens.

The main difference between The Sword of Hope II and its predecessor
 is the fact that you have control over a party of up to three characters rather than controlling only prince Theo. Apart from that, both games play very similar. The world is seen from a first person perspective and your party can be moved by selecting an arrow that points in the desired direction. Commands such as &amp;quot;look&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;open&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;hit&amp;quot; etc. can be chosen from a menu to explore and manipulate the game-world, talk to NPCs or solve puzzles. When encountering enemies, you enter a turn-based battle mode in which you can attack, use items and magic or try to escape.</resource>

    <resource id="ade1d0550a849372f366dda5dea264a5286f381f" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">A dragon has gained control over the king of Riccar, manipulating him into removing the Sword of Hope from a painting, releasing its curse. Summoning the dark power mammon the dragon turned the people of Riccar into trees. When Prince Theo is born, the king tries to murder him, but Theo is saved by the brave knight Pascal who flees with him  into a forest where three magicians live who conceal the king's castle underground to prevent the evil from spreading. After living in the forest for 15 years, Prince Theo is finally strong enough to try and stop the dragon, using the Sword of Hope one of the magicians had retrieved.

Sword of Hope combines Adventure and RPG elements. The prince can select commands such as &amp;quot;look&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;open&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;magic&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;use&amp;quot; etc. to interact with  the game world, talk to NPCs or solve puzzles. When he encounters an enemy, the game switches to a turn based battle mode in which enemies have to be fought in typical console style RPG battles.</resource>

    <resource id="f10c5a04031d59d329f573f0182e862fe0364fa0" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">As the title states, this is the home conversion of the arcade rail-shooter based on the film Terminator 2: Judgement Day. Up to two players shoot through future and present levels as robotic killers reprogrammed to serve the human resistance. 

Both players wield a machine gun with infinite ammo that lowers its firing rate (overheats) as it is continuously fired. A secondary weapon (missile launchers in the future, shotguns in the present) has limited ammo but deals heavy damage. Powerups inside the game world include secondary weapon ammo and coolant for the machine guns, and are shot to be collected.

T2: The Arcade Game features seven levels based on specific scenes or general concepts in the film. The first four levels act as a prelude, as the player guns down waves of metal Terminators across a post-apocalyptic Battlefield, a besieged Human Hideout, and through the security checkpoints of the enemy supercomputer SkyNet. After destroying the computer, players travel back in time to protect John and Sarah Connor, while also destroying every scrap of SkyNet research at the headquarters of its manufacturer. From there, players must fend off the indestructible T-1000 until the final showdown in the Steel Mill.

Assets from the movie are used when possible, such as voice clips from Arnold Schwarzenegger, and close-up digital stills of Robert Patrick for the final battle against the T-1000. The Genesis and SNES versions also support lightguns (the Menacer and Super Scope, respectively).

Despite being released only in Japan, the game is fully playable for non-Japanese speakers. The only thing you would be missing is the brief story, but there is a fan translation patch for anyone curious about the game.

The game consists of eight areas which you can beat in any order to unlock the final areas. Each area has a total of five stages that need to be beaten before you can clear the area and move onto the next one. Every area features a unique theme with cutesy graphics of enemies that are also surprisingly well animated for a GB game. The goal of each stage is to make all the flowers bloom while avoiding enemies and preventing them from destroying your work.</resource>

Unlike the actual Tamagotchi toy, the Game Boy version is not in realtime - you can adjust the Tamagotchi's growth speed in the game options.  You can also look after up to three Tamagotchis simultaneously.  The Game Boy version also features three different games to play with your pet - depending on the game you select, it will improve their mood, their intelligence, or their physical fitness.  The three games are:

 Smile Game - Your pet will look left and right.  Try to guess which direction it will face next.
 Study Game - Help your Tamagotchi study.  Simple math questions will appear and you must help it answer them.
 Sports Game - Keep your Tamagotchi fit.  Baseballs will rain down from the sky.  Get your pet to them before they hit the floor to score a point.

Another feature exclusive to the Game Boy version are Tournaments.  You can enter your pet in Race, Beauty and Knowledge tournaments.  You can increase your chances of winning in these by training your pet, but make sure that when you enter them that it's not sick or spoiled, as it will not perform as well as it could.  Win a tournament and your Tamagotchi will be placed in the Hall of Fame.</resource>

Found and brought up by a she-ape named Kala, he grew to learn the ways of the jungle and the language of the beasts. Years later, as John Clayton, Lord of Greystoke, he was brought back to England to claim his rightful inheritance. However, he occasionally returns to the wild to become Tarzan, Lord of the Jungle.

Now is one of those occasions. Tarzan has returned to the jungle with his wife, Lady Jane Greystoke, but their holiday came to an end when Usanga, evil chief of the Wamabo, kidnaps Jane to force Tarzan into retrieving the seven gemstones that were stolen from his tribal shrine. These gemstones are believed to be the Eyes of the Rainbow, representing each color of the spectrum. Tarzan has been given three days to find the gemstones, otherwise Jane will be eaten by the tribal pet, Sheeta the Panther.

After consulting his information sources, Tarzan learns that the Eyes of the Rainbow have been scattered around the dense jungle by a family of pesky chimps. Tarzan's quest involves navigating dark caves, crevasses, swamps, and treacherous quicksand. 

Objects, such as the rope and torch, need to be found if Tarzan wants to find each gemstone. Throughout the quest, hazards such asheadhunters, lions, snakes, spiders, quicksands, and pits are encountered. If Tarzan comes into contact with any of these hazards, he becomes stunned for an hour and the on-screen timer shrinks accordingly. Fortunately, he can punch creatures, allowing him to escape them.

If Tarzan manages to find all seven gemstones within the time limit and deliver them to Usanga, Jane will be released. If not, she will become nothing more than another bowl of jungle soup.</resource>

The tie-in game, however, is nothing but a remake of Pony Canyon's 1984 title Fruit Panic.

A single-screen platformer, you guide a man with a hat from platform to platform. Since he can't jump by himself, you must use the trampolines to the left and right to make him reach the right platform, where he can pick up cactuses, flowers and other plants. When all plants are picked, the next stage follows. What makes the game hard are the &amp;quot;Tasmanian devils&amp;quot; which hunt your man. By dropping on a devil from above, or laying a bomb for an enemy to walk into, you can temporarily stun them.</resource>

Somewhere on Tazmania is a Lost Valley, and in that valley nests a huge seabird, so huge that one of it's eggs could feed a family for a year! Just think of the omelette one of those could make!

Thus Taz becomes fascinated and leaves in search of one of those eggs before his Dad has even finished the story...

Taz can Jump, perform a Spinning Jump and a Spin Attack. Munch roast chickens to replenish life. Gain extra points by moving quickly through the levels - there are six stages and each stage has two rounds.

There are a few other items and pickups such as:
Spring: boings Taz up to high ledges.
Blocks: destructible.
1-UP: extra life.
Star: invulnerability. Unless you run into a bomb.
Bomb: does what it says on the tin.</resource>

    <resource id="0051580c92a1a75dfaaf232ab8686c949165fce6" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">The most popular American football game to hit the NES console, Tecmo Bowl pits the player vs. the computer in 11 game single-elimination playoff action, or you can go head-to-head with a human opponent in action or coach mode.  There are 12 teams of real NFL players (circa 1988) to choose from, but don't look for official NFL team logos or mascots like Bears or Dolphins--Tecmo Bowl has the NFLPA but not the NFL license.

The play perspective is top-down and the screen scrolls horizontally.  Player graphics are large and colorful, which is made possible by limiting the number of players to nine per team.  Animated cut-scenes are shown following touchdowns and at half-time, and crowds are shown filling the endzone seats.

There are four plays to choose from on offense--usually two runs and two passes. The player takes control of the quarterback before the snap and then either hands off to the running back or works through his receiver progression from the top to the bottom of the screen.  Defense consists of trying to guess which offensive play the opponent will select and then taking control of one of the defensive players before the snap.  A very simple power meter system is used for kicking field goals, extra points, and punts.

There are no game or season stats and there is no way to save your season, but there is a password feature allowing you to resume tournament play where you left off. </resource>

Each turtle has a different ability which is necessary to finish the game. Michaelangelo can hover using his nunchakus as a helicopter, Leonardo can drill the floor by spinning with his katana, Raphael can hide himself inside his shell to enter passages that are otherwise too small to enter, and Donatello can stick to and climb walls.

The bosses are Scratch, Dirtbag, a Triceraton, Scale Tale, and Shredder (in this game known as Cyber-Shredder).</resource>

The game is a side-scroller. The player moves from left to right, shooting enemies and jumping over obstacles in the platforming stages. There are also time-limited mini-games, such as re-arranging wires to form a connected path, as well as other types of stages. The stages are based on key scenes from the film.

At the beginning of the game, the player appears to be in the future, with Terminators attacking the player, and a Hunter Killer type robot dropping explosives around the player.</resource>

Simple yet colorful symbol graphics make for endless hours of gameplay... akin to how one can play MineSweeper or Tetris on end, this game got into your head. Gameplay consisted of &amp;quot;flipping&amp;quot; tesserae, or tiles, from squares over adjacent squares. The result would either create a complex tile, or cancel out, resulting in the deletion of a tile. The goal was to clear the board entirely. Higher levels were designated by added tile complexity, and larger board grid sizes.</resource>

The goal is to place pieces made up of four tiles in a ten-by-twenty well, organizing them into complete rows, which then disappear. As rows are cleared, the pace of the game increases and the background changes, and the game ends if the stack reaches the top of the well.

The game is very similar to Nintendo's own NES version of the game, featuring the same &amp;quot;Type A&amp;quot; endless and &amp;quot;Type B&amp;quot; set-clear modes. The game also features a 2-player versus mode that can be played with two Game Boys, two copies of Tetris, and a Game Boy link cable. Clearing lines in this mode will cause the other player's stack to rise, with the goal being to make the other player lose.</resource>

Each play field starts with different colored dots (in this case black, gray and white), with one of each color flashing. 

The blocks are made up of the same three colors, and by matching blocks of the same color over the top or to the side of the dot will clear the dot and those blocks from the screen. If you clear a flashing dot, all the corresponding dots of the same color will be cleared.

To complete the round just clear the dots, not the blocks themselves.</resource>

The devious king Bowser has cast a spell on the island's inhabitants, turning them into his mindless slaves. Only Yoshi has escaped its effects, and so he must set off to free his friends, and to defeat Bowser and break the spell.

Tetris Attack is a fact-paced action puzzler featuring the colorful cast of characters from Yoshi's Island. A stack of blocks continually rises from the bottom of the screen, and the player controls a cursor which can swap any two blocks horizontally. Make a row or column of three or more and they'll clear, potentially creating combos from new blocks falling to take their place. Combos will send large garbage blocks to your opponent, which must be eliminated by clearing a piece that is touching it, turning it into normal blocks.

The game offers a story mode against the computer, as well as a 2-player versus mode, an endless mode, a timed mode where a certain number of blocks must be cleared, and a puzzle mode where a set arrangement of blocks must be cleared in a specific number of moves. The game is based on the Japan-only title Panel de Pon.</resource>

The usual gameplay modes are included, i.e. challenge, clear as many lines as possible, time trial, clear as many lines as possible before time runs out and 2 player battle.</resource>

Of course, Buster can't sit too still on that, so he's going to try and enter the movies and change the plots so Montana can't win at his dirty scheme of ruining Buster's reputation!

This basketball game has like the Kick Off games a top down view and the action is quite pacey, a trademark for many football games of the day (Kick Off in particular). The teams in the game are British but you can edit them using the built-in utilities. 

The game also has a tactics designer and the option to change the kits of each team. You can play either single matches or a full league competition. Tip Off can be played by four players simultaneously, so can play co-op with a friend against the computer, or just compete against one or two other players.</resource>

There are secret rooms to find, and bosses at the end of each level. The player can also interact with many parts of the background. Using available objects such as springs and crates correctly is often vital to progress. Alternate modes of transport such as Magic Carpets and Skateboards also make an appearance.

Game controls are simple: B Button makes Jerry/Tuffy to jump (tapping it again lightly upon landing will activate their Super Jumps), while A/Y/X Buttons will make them to throw marbles upward (Y Button) and downward (X/Y Buttons) in the enemies.

To earn extra lives throughout the game, players have two available options: the rarest and, sometimes, hardest way is to find a 1-Up icon; however, the easiest mode is to collect 100 of small balls of cheese scattered throughout the levels (Cheese Bits). Also, Jerry and Tuffy's health meters are displayed in the form of four hearts, that can be replenished through collectible larger cheese wedges (Cheese Chunks). At the end of each world, Jerry and Tuffy will take a confrontation with Tom, the Cat.</resource>

Naturally, a dictator named General Akhboob took control of the beleagured nation and began creating an army of radioactive mutants. With a virtually impenetrable stronghold, a bunch of hostages, and a legion of mutants under his command, the evil despot will stop at nothing but world domination. Only two men have the courage and idealistic naivete to take on Akhboob and his forces: Captain Carnage and Major Mayhem, also known as the Doomsday Squad.

As Captain Carnage or Major Mayhem, it is up to you or you and a friend (in simultaneous action) to rescue the hostages while shooting hundreds of mutants bent on your destruction. As you walk and run forward, backward, left, right, and diagonally through 20 battlezones of nonstop action, you'll always have your machine gun by your side. Additional weapons which you can find along the way include grenade launchers, rocket launchers, plasma machine guns, flame throwers, spray-fire rifles, defensive blades, and an assortment of bombs.</resource>

Pitting your tankmanship against a villainous tank master who is creating machine of destruction that has taken over the land.

You can fire from multiple angles but due to the control limitations of the Game Boy, your vehicle can only turn his turret clockwise.

There are a few power ups which increase your weapons like explosive cannonballs, multi-direction shots or anti-armor shells. 

The game also features some boss fights as you progress through the game's several different environments, forest, desert, cave, city, and tank factory.</resource>

It is being protected by an old Shabubu, a member of a race of bunny-like beings. The flower grows on the holy mountain known as Mount Dubious. However, one day the old Shabubu is attacked and the Maita Flower is stolen. Trip World becomes disarranged and its inhabitants don't stop quarreling with each other. But there is one hope in the form of the old Shabubu's grandson, Yacopu (also spelled Yakopoo).

The player controls Yacopu through five stages in this side-scrolling platformer. The young Shabubu's trademark ability is to shapeshift into different forms. In his normal form, he is able to walk and jump as well as to kick enemies, Yacopu's primary way of attacking. Unlike in many other platformers, many of the enemies don't harm you on contact and push your character around instead. However, certain foes might attack you after you damaged them, while others do so from the beginning.

At almost any time, the player can change to the flying or fish form. Flying Yacopu is able to reach places he wouldn't otherwise be able to, while the fishy hero is best suited for underwater areas. You also come across power-ups that temporarily give your character new powers, such as stunning enemies with seeds, bouncing around as a ball, or attacking with an extended tail. Beneath the mountain, settings in the game include a jungle, the ocean, and a castle. In each stages, you have to defeat a boss at the end. Eventually, you will encounter the one who stole the Maita Flower. The flower must be retrieved in order to save peace in Trip World.</resource>

After crashing his ship on Earth while in pursuit of the evil alien Bemular, the super-being Ultraman is here to help whenever the attacking aliens prove too much for humanity alone to handle. Standing hundreds of feet tall with incredible strength and amazing abilities, he can only remain on Earth for a few minutes, and so must defeat his foes before his power drains completely.

Based on the popular television show from 1967, Ultraman directly follows the story of its source material. Cast in the role of the titular Ultraman, the player must defeat many of the same monsters that appeared in the original series. Taking the appearance of a 1-on-1 fighting game, Ultraman can punch, kick, and grapple his opponent, as well as use a variety of various special moves that must be charged. However, in order to actually defeat his opponent, Ultraman must deplete their continually-recharging life bar, and at that moment hit with his most powerful special attack: the Specium Beam. As the game continues, different enemies may even find ways to avoid this most formidable attack, and Ultraman must adapt... Each stage has a time limit of only three minutes, and there are three lives and no continues.</resource>

Ultraman is re-imagined as a hero who is able to transform into a ball mode, and uses this new power to save his friends.

In his standard bipedal form, Ultraman is able to cling onto walls and climb up them by repeatedly jumping. As the ball, Ultraman can bowl over enemies and build speed on slopes to help him reach new areas. He can also bounce, which also increases his vertical height. By combining these powers, the player can progress through each stage.</resource>

As in most RPGs, you can move freely in the city and visit others, talk to NPCs and buy things that will be mostly related to fishing. In order to fish, you will have to find a suitable spot and once you catch a fish, you can keep it and feed it. While walking you can make random encounters. You will be transferred to a different screen and you will have the choice of throwing things at the enemy to make them run away, or running to safety. However, the latter option leaves you vulnerable to the enemy as it will be possible for them to attack you and thus see your life bar depleted.</resource>

But whereas that title was a beat-em-up, Hakaishin Garumaa instead takes place as a turn-based board game RPG. Similar in design to the later Mario Party titles, players begin by choosing one of three of the undercover cops. The player begins at the start location of the board and must use one of their &amp;quot;numbered value tiles&amp;quot;. If the number chosen is above 1, the player must compete on a slot machine to try to win a value up to what was written on the tile. Following that, the player is able to move the number value, which they have won, of spaces on the board. Certain squares will activate events that include talking with characters, buying items and engaging in battle.

Battles with enemies are handled by each side choosing one of the numbered tiles they own. The party with the higher number becomes the attacker and the lower value becomes the defender. Each side then chooses another numbered tile to determine the amount of &amp;quot;effort&amp;quot; put into the attack or defense as well as a position of the body to attack/defend. With that chosen, the turn's sequence plays out, with HP lost on a successful impact. Upon defeating an opponent in battle, the player gains XP and gold.</resource>

All the familiar characters appear in this game. The game combines a quest for a girl and a 3D dungeon crawler in a half-hearted way, but it fits the mold. It seems to have enough gameplay to convince fans. However, while the main story is adequate, the branches and leaves are weak. The story tends to follow a pattern, so it may be the kind of game that requires patience to continue.</resource>

It was just the second video game based on World Championship Wrestling, and the first of two released to a handheld console.

Gameplay

There are two types of matches available: a set number of falls (best of one, three, or five) and a set time limit (five, ten, or fifteen minutes). Each wrestler has his unique special move along with punch, clothesline, bodyslam, suplex, dropkick, and cross body block. One can choose between a single match and an elimination match which runs the gauntlet of the remaining wrestlers.
Throwing one's opponent out of the ring is possible, as is fighting outside of the ring. There is no ten-count while both wrestlers are outside of the ring, but one will start after one enters.
[edit]Wrestlers

These wrestlers used in the game were considered to be the top-ranked superstars of the WCW as of 1993. They were Rick Rude, Ron Simmons, Steve Austin, Sting, Dustin Rhodes, Johnny B. Badd, Big Van Vader and former tag team duo The Steiner Brothers (who had left for the WWF but still appeared in the game anyway).</resource>

The lower their energy, the greater the chance of them being pinned. The goal of the match is to pin down your opponent till the referee counts to three.</resource>

He has heard that the pirates of Kitchen Island have a golden Statue of Princess Toadstool that's worth a king's ransom!  Wario figures that if he swipes the Princess' statue for himself, as well as all the other loot the pirates have hoarded, he'll have more than enough cash for a castle that's even bigger and better than Mario's!

Wario Land: Super Mario Land 3 is different from previous games in the series in that you control the brutish and greedy Wario.  Even when small, Wario can break most bricks with a punch, and some enemies are so weak to him that they'll just be pushed aside!  Wario has a body slam attack that he can use to destroy enemies, and he can also pick them up and throw them at his foes.  If that wasn't enough, there are three different power ups that Wario can find. The Bull Hat lets him plough through bricks in a single hit, ram his horns into the ceiling to hold onto it, and butt stomp to stun all enemies.  The Jet Hat allows him to fly horizontally for a short period of time, and increases his jump height and speed.  Finally, the Dragon Hat allows him to breathe a long stream of fire for a short period of time.

To suit Wario's greedy nature, the game revolves around money.  Throughout the stages, you can earn coins by grabbing them floating in the air, punching them out of bricks, or by body slamming into foes and then collecting the coins they drop.  You can also find hidden treasures buried deep within some levels by finding a key and then throwing it at the skull door to unlock it.  Once Wario reaches the end of a level, he usually needs to pay a toll to get the end-of-level door to open.  Pressing Up on the Control Pad and B pulls out a coin worth 10 coins, which you must throw at the door.  Once the door opens, you can exit and the level is complete.  Before you finish each level, you can choose to play a mini-game that doubles or halves the amount of coins you have, with a 50/50 chance.  You get three tries, and can choose to leave whenever you wish...so don't get too greedy!

As Wario, you must clean the place up and take back what you now call your own.

In a change from the original Wario Land, Wario is now immortal, to a certain point. Instead of dying when hit by an enemy, Wario loses the coins he collected along his travels in each level. And he can also turn into other Warios. For example, if he is hit by a bee, Wario puffs up into a giant ball of air, and floats up to the top of the level. Only when hit by a sharp object will he return to normal. There are other types, like Fire Wario and Zombie Wario, and each can have its advantages, like getting to other areas otherwise unreachable, or they can halt your progress.</resource>

The game itself is a classic point and click adventure, and should not be confused with the platform game based on the movie.

You play both Wayne and Garth, and you can switch between them at any time. The plot is simple; In an attempt to save their tv-show, Wayne and Garth decide to hold a pizza-thon (a charity show with a pizza-theme) in order to raise money. In order to be able to hold the pizza-thon Wayne and Garth must embark on several quests to collect items and hire people they need for the show. The adventure includes participating in babe-jeopardy, joining a biker's gang and baking pizza. The graphics are in 2D and the sound contains several samples from the movie. </resource>

    <resource id="ded78d949c1535eb3bc2af41d956e9355f63fc86" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Wheel of Fortune is based on the popular game show produced by Merv Griffin.  The goal is the same as the game show, which is to guess missing letters to solve a puzzle which covers the same subjects as found on the show, such as place, person, thing, phrase, etc. Like the game show, the players spin the wheel, select consonants, buy vowels and hopefully, solve the mystery phrase.  The wheel can be &amp;quot;spun&amp;quot; at different strengths by sliding a bar across a selector, and the chances of earning a free spin, losing a turn, and going bankrupt remain.

Game play is for up to two players taking turns, or for one player against the computer.  Gameplay moves through three rounds, and a bonus round for a grand prize.  Winning is accomplished, essentially, by earning the most money and winning the game by solving the phrases.

There is even a &amp;quot;sexy model&amp;quot; that animates out onto the &amp;quot;stage&amp;quot;--though the resemblance to Vanna White is minimal at best.</resource>

Acme's will states that upon his death, Toon Town would be left ot the Toons, but the will is nowhere to be found.

The game takes place in Hollywood, 1947, where Toons are alive. There are 4 levels in the game, 2 of which are driving levels (levels 1 &amp; 3). Roger and Benny the cab have to beat the weasels to the destination, while dodging cars, trams and Judge Doom's dip which is scattered on the road. There are pick-ups to help you on your way.

Level 2 is the Ink &amp; Paint Club. The will is on one of the tables. Roger has to pick up all the pieces of paper the penguin waiters put down, whilst avoiding the alcohol and gorilla bouncer.

Level 4 has you in Judge Dooms warehouse trying to save your wife, Jessica from the dip truck. You have to use gags to progress and make the weasels laugh themselves to death, literally!</resource>

    <resource id="06f89977cad123ceb43821bd370e9e983b2fb67a" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">World Bowling is a bowling game in which the player has to beat bowling alleys from six different countries (England, China, Japan, Canada, France, USA). To win the game, all alleys have to be beaten in a row with an increasing points requirement (200 to 250) - if the score is missed once, it is back to the beginning.

The player can set the weight of the bowling ball: a heavier ball has more power but this goes in turn with a loss of control. It also depends on the chosen player character: the male is better with heavy balls while the female character should use a lighter one. The throw itself is divided into three parts: character position on the alley, control and power. While the first is simply chosen by lining the character up, the latter two are reaction games: a marker goes from left to right (and vice versa) and the player has to hit the button when the marker reaches the desired point. A high value (i.e. the marker is right) in control means that the throw is straight while a high power determines the speed and strength.</resource>

Changes done to the 3D engine feature include on the fly in-game management with better player positioning AI (including the goalkeeper), and faster gameplay. An editor to change all player information is included, which affects simulated data: the team with higher ratings has a better chance of progressing through the next stage regardless if it is Brazil or China.

It's possible to play with the groups as determined by the real draw,  randomize or customize them to the players' likings, mixing both qualified and additional teams. Once the player wins a trophy, the first of the Classics matches is unlocked. These are eight final matches in the competition's history which are unlocked as the player beats them one by one. Friendlies, training matches and practice penalty shootouts close the modes available.</resource>

Gameplay is turn-based. Each turn, the player can control one specific worm from his team. The worm can crawl left and right or jump. However, there is a time limit to make a move; also, if the worm falls from a great height, it loses health and the turn ends immediately; and if a worm falls into water or offscreen, it dies. Each turn, a worm can also make a single attack: the player can aim up and down, choose a weapon and then fire it. After attacking, the turn ends. 

There's a lot of weapons available - the standard ones as bazookas (which is affected by the (random) wind settings and gravity) and grenades. The others include a Fire Punch, dynamite, air strikes, and utilities such as ropes and girders.

There are 10 styles of terrain, ranging from forests and deserts to Candy land and the moon (complete with affected gravity). Shots leave craters in the ground, and complex tunnels can be formed.</resource>

There are ten missions with different objective ranging from restoring power to a power plant, to 'seek and destroy' missions. The player can guide the tank freely across the over world, but there are enemy patrols that will open fire. The alternative is going though underground tunnels, where there are spots to replenish the tank and its weapons. The player only has a limited amount of time for each mission, and shielding for the tank. If either runs out, the game is over.</resource>

Each group of enemies you destroy grants you a cash reward and every once in a while you enter Colin's Bargain Basement, where you can use this cash to purchase upgrades for your ship like better weapons, speed &amp; health upgrades etc. Some upgrades can also be picked up during the levels.

The first part of the game has an organic feel to it, while the second part of the game features mechanical enemies. As there are some maze-like sections with dead-ends in the game, your spaceship  scrolls backwards when you keep pressing the down key.

A typical Bitmap Brothers smash, the game is also famous for its soundtrack by British electronica group Bomb The Bass.

From their fortress they launch a missile that will flood the world with Akudamas, eggs of darkness which hatch into evil monsters called Evil Beasts based on things that annoy or frustrate humans.
The &amp;quot;guardian of light&amp;quot; Eldran appears, an Ultraman-like entity who is sworn to protect the universe and Earth in particular then appears. Using the heroic robot Raijin-Oh, Eldran attempts to thwart the Evil Empire by preventing a missile from striking Earth. What happens instead is that the missile detonated against Eldran, throwing Raijin-Oh down to Earth. The robot crashes into Japan's Hinobori city, elementary school Hinobori School.
Eldran must leave to continue protecting the Earth, so he leaves the duty of defeating the Evil Beasts to a 5th grade classroom full of children, Earth Defense Class in the school where he crashed. He entrusts the children with Raijin-Oh, granting each child a different role to perform in either operating or supporting Raijin-Oh. Eldran also transforms their school itself, so it can transform into a command center when Raijin-Oh is needed. Jin, Asuka and Kouji are chosen to lead Raijin-oh, but every day they have many amusing experiences in the school. Jin does not want to study, while his friends do and force him to do it by tickling him.</resource>

In order to eliminate the other shapes, you must point your piece at it and 'fire'. If the shape is the same color as your piece, the shape is eliminated, as well as all of the shapes of the same color behind it, until your piece hits a piece of a different color. If the shape is of a different color, or it is hit when collecting a line of similar shapes, your piece exchanges colors with the shape.</resource>

You begin the game inside a training simulation, which upon successful completion ensures your transfer to the crew of the seaQuest DSV where you will be called upon to perform the same duties.

Primarily, your function is to navigate the seaQuest Deep Submergence Vessel around the underwater map to various 'mission areas' where you will be called upon to use the on board vehicles to accomplish some task. Typical missions include salvage operations, rescue operations, disarmament of underwater explosives, termination of enemies and exploration. Damage of underwater property is deducted from your budget and completion of objectives adds to it. The money must be used to resupply weapons and buy additional vehicles. Underwater is a dangerous place.

The vehicles you have at your command includeSpeeder: A simple two-man vessel designed entirely for speed. It is also a combat vessel and may fire forwards, move up &amp; down and change orientation between facing left and facing right
Stinger: A prototype &amp;quot;next generation&amp;quot; attack vessel, this one-man sub allows you to orientate in any direction to fire your weapon accurately.
Sea Crab: A slow vehicle used for excavation, mining, and rescue missions. It is the only vessel that can dock with other vessels and one of only two that can pick up undersea objects for transport. It comes with a water jet to clear debris and a retractable drill
Sea Truck: Slow and bulky, this vessel may move up and down and change it's orientation between left and right. It's weapons are torpedoes and mines which may be dropped behind it. Furthermore it can also pick up undersea objects for transport
Remote (HR) Probe: Small and agile, this vehicle contains only a very simple weapon. It's main purpose however is underwater welding and repair of objects. It can also activate switches
Darwin - Intelligent Dolphin and seaQuest mascot: Darwin the Dolphin is perhaps the most agile of the vehicles, and may take off in bursts of speed. However Darwin has no weapons with which to defend himself and is very vulnerable. Darwin is able to get into tiny spaces that none of the other vehicles can reach. Darwin is able to activate switches.</resource>

The scenario was written by the Japanese author Benny Matsuyama, and is not based on any Wizardry game developed by Sir-tech. Developed by ASCII, the same company that created console versions of other Wizardry games, Wizardry Gaiden II shares many similarities to other console entries in the series in style.

The game takes place in the city of Al-Mar, an oasis haven in the eastern desert. Workers in the city have been working tirelessly to uncover the mystery of nearby ruins, but to no avail. Near-daily cave-ins have killed or stranded many, and the labyrinth's mysteries only seem to deepen. It isn't until a warning carved into a metal plate is discovered that the people of Al-Mar realize the great evil they have awoken: their city was built upon the grave of the ancient sorcerer-emperor Harugisu.

Many who had lost their lives exploring the cave rose from the dead, the the city hung in darkness. Not even the Chamberlin Udin was spared, his own daughter seemingly overpowered by the darkness that has enveloped the city. His own soldiers refused to enter the labyrinth, and the situation grew dire. </resource>
