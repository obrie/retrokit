The player takes the role of Gomez who searches for his missing family members. To find them he has to explore six different parts of the mansion, e.g. the woods, which are basic platform levels: the player moves from left to right while jumping a lot and avoiding enemies. Some of them can be dispatched of by a jump on their heads. 

The main difference to the other versions of this game is a unique level design. There is also a life meter which allows to get hit more often before dying.</resource>

The player takes control solely of Batman, as the Joker has kidnapped Robin in order to lure Batman into a game. Furthermore, the Jokers lets Gotham's most feared criminals compete with one another in order to distract Batman. Naturally, Batman has to take care of the other master criminals, too, while trying to free Robin.

The Adventures of Batman &amp; Robin is 2D platformer/ beat'em up. The goal in each stage and level is to walk from left to right to reach the (sub)boss and the end of the stage. To beat his foes, Batman uses punches and kicks in close combat and several weapons for short distances. Batman has an unlimited supply of Batarangs with him from the beginning, and there are four more weapons available. Apart from simple jumping, Batman can also perform a double jump to reach higher places and can hold on to ledges.</resource>

Like other versions, it is a side-scrolling action game. The player controls Aladdin, making his way through a variety of locations, including the streets of Agrabah, the Cave of Wonders, the Sultan's palace and more. Gameplay takes several different forms: some levels are chases, where Aladdin runs automatically, but must be made to jump over chasms or rolling rocks and barrels, evade falling objects and avoid getting caught by a guard. Other levels are platforming affairs: Aladdin must run, jump and climb, find keys or switches to open doors while searching for the exit. Rocks can be collected and be thrown to dispatch enemies or hit buttons otherwise out of reach. Finally, there are also several magic carpet rides in the game, in which the level scrolls automatically and the player must make sure to avoid any obstacles in the way.

Gameplay features all the usual moves: smashes, passing shots, volleys and all kinds of backhand and forehand plays, but unlike other games, precise positioning and timing are crucial to avoid hitting the ball outside the court, swinging the racket into thin air or more embarrassing, let the ball hit you on the head.
Three courts are available: Grass, Clay and Indoor (Sega versions  add a fourth, Hard), but the differences between them are minimal. Game modes change according to the version, with the 16-bit versions including a &amp;quot;Skins&amp;quot; game, where each point is worth a sum of money based on the number of times the ball was hit.</resource>

    <resource id="e231aa853951d90f1b969f0e3dcbe0e65d388536" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">In the year 2026, a corrupt government has used a television broadcasting company called Astralnet Broadcasting Company to secretly control the population and keep them brainwashed.  During these times a group of pro-democratic rebels, led by Guy Freelander, has obtained a secret taped meeting between top government officials and ABC directors discussing their diabolical plans.  Convinced that if they play the tape through ABC's broadcasting, they can convince the repressed population to rise up against the current regime.  The only problem that stands in their way is the way to the broadcasting center, a death trap nicknamed the maze.

The player takes control of Guy Freelander and must transverse this maze, with 20 levels and 100 different rooms in total, using a standard gun and a knife to take out security guards, androids, mutants and must avoid various pitfalls and traps scattered in these rooms.  The view of the game is isometric and has a password feature to allow players to pick up and return to the previous room they were in without having to replay the previous levels.  There are no life bars, instead the player can take four hits before their character dies with five lives.  After losing these five lives, the game will be over.</resource>

Friends like Flounder and Sebastian can also be summoned for a little helping hand.

It is 50 B.C., and the entire Gaul (today's France) is conquered by the Romans. Only one village still remains independent, thanks to the incredible powers of its two great warriors, Asterix and Obelix. In the game, they must first of all liberate the village Orvio and rescue their friend Dogmatix.

You can play as either Asterix or Obelix. You make your way through platform levels, fighting enemies by punching them, and jumping to access higher ares or to avoid falling down. There are also some items you can collect, such as bombs, with which you can overcome obstacles and advance in the game.

In this side-scrolling action game, the player can choose to play either Astérix or Obelix at the start of each one of the six levels. Although the main setting of each level is the same to both characters (forests, caves, deserts, underwater stages, waterfalls and such) the level design for each one may vary. In two player mode (Master System version), players will take turns playing as Astérix and Obelix. Both characters jump (by pressing button 2), punch enemies and break blocks (by pressing button 1). Astérix can run can run (by pressing and holding button 1 while moving) and double jump (by pressing 2 in the middle of a jump). Obélix is stronger and can break several bricks in a row when jumping over them (pressing 1 while jumping), and can also slide down hills (by pressing down at them).

Astérix can get some potions (thrown by pressing up and 1), which can break rocks, kill or shrink enemies. Obelix can get miniature menhirs which can be thrown (by pressing up and 1) against enemies. Both characters can also get bones throughout the game, granting access to bonus stages where the player controls Dogmatix. Some levels also involve minor puzzle solving, like pushing switches or moving rock blocks.

As before, the action is viewed from within the cockpit, but depicted using sprites rather than polygons. 

There are three main modes:

1. Senna GP: Features three non-championship circuits with a preliminary race followed by three laps. 

2. World Championship: The full 16-race championship. There are two modes in the championship mode that affect how the game is played. Beginner is a regular season, with the same difficulty level as the remaining modes, and cars have roughly the same power. Each race has three laps. In Master things get a twist. There are five groups of cars, and the player starts on the lowly competitive SERGA team. To climb the ranks and get a chance of claim the title the player must challenge a driver from other team and beat him to the top spot. The winner of this particular race gets (or holds) the fastest car. Races are also longer in this mode, and pit-stops are activated, required if the player knocks on too many objects or other cars frequently. 

3. Free Practice: This allows the player to drive on any race without caring for championship positions. There are two options in Free Practice: Free Run is just the player against the clock and Image Training is a race, but instead of having to quality and then run the three laps, the player can set the number of laps (between one and six), starting position and the condition of the track (dry or wet, only on some circuits).

While each mode presents it's own variations, the core of each race is the same: Along controller setup options, the player can choose between an Automatic or Manual with 4 or 7 speeds gearbox, and races against 16 drivers. The car can be instantly wrecked if it goes on top speed against a roadside object.</resource>

But the King says she already has too many, and she can't take care of so many animals. Thus the Minister purposes a contest of skill and daring to select the Royal Zookeeper. Master Piggy then sends his pupil, Polly, to participate in the contest.

Baku Baku Animal is a variation on the very often copied Tetris type of game. The game has three different play modes: practice, normal and hard. It also can be played by two players against each other (except for the Master System version).

The objective is to pair animal heads with their respective food. If a rabbit head comes falling, you must make it fall on a pile of carrot tiles, dog heads with bones, panda heads with bamboos and monkey heads with bananas. There is a bonus item, the &amp;quot;BB coin&amp;quot;, which will appear from times to times, and remove piled tiles from the playfield. Removed tiles will be sent to the opponent's playfield all at once, increasing the difficulty of the task. Polly will face several contestants, and she'll win when her opponents get their playfield piled to the top.</resource>

This game is an usual hybrid of side-scrolling platformer and one-on-one fighter. The player makes way through levels that include some platform jumping elements, but take on opponents one at a time like in a fighting game. The player's arsenal includes a lot of nifty bat-gadgets and a collection of fighting moves that are unleashed with special button combinations.

The graphics were rendered completely with digitized actors and objects, but none of the actors from the movie make an appearance in the game.</resource>

Like other versions, it is a side-scrolling platformer. While very similar to the Master System version, the Game Gear version has slightly different levels and gameplay mechanics.

Batman must move through five stages on his way to defeat the Penguin. These include the streets and rooftops of Gotham City, Max Shreck's department store, the sewers, and the Penguin's lair. For the first four levels, a route can be selected from two options, allowing for different paths through the game.

Enemies standing in Batman's way can be defeated by throwing the Batarang at them, which will take out most baddies with one or just a few hits, even though the weapon's range is limited. Other tools Batman can use are a grappling hook to pull himself up to higher levels or swing across dangerous areas, and his cape, which can be used as a parachute, for more control during falls.

Unlike in the Master System version, Batman can take more than one hit: he has a health bar, which can be refilled with powerups hidden in bat symbols.</resource>

You can play as either Sister or Brother Bear. From the beginning, you can access four different levels. Once you complete them, you'll unlock the final stage. The bears can jump, throw rocks at enemies, or swing a net to hit them. In each area there are a lot of things to gather - mostly food. After a level is completed, you'll be shown how much valuable stuff you have managed to get.</resource>

The player takes control of a boy who must use his hammer to break the blocks that form part of the platform levels that form each stage. These holes act as traps for the many patrolling monsters and once one has fallen into a hole, the player may then use the hammer on the monster to make it fall through the hole and down to the platform below - causing it to change into fruit or power-ups, which can then be collected.

This game bears a number of similarities to Space Panic, generally considered as the first platform video game.</resource>

Players take the role of Jonathan Harker whose mission to to destroy Count Dracula by first heading to Transylvania and then London.

Jonathan Harker can move left and right, jump and attack with a weapon, the most basic of which is a knife. The status display on the screen shows Harker's health bar, countdown timer to complete the level and currently held weapon.  Throughout the levels question mark boxes (similar to the Mario games) can be found, attacking these will reveal power ups which include health restoration, timer increase and new weapons. Among these new weapons are axes, daggers and a shotgun. Question mark boxes can also be used as platforms to reach other areas and enemies. Each stage is divided into two sections: the &amp;quot;Daytime&amp;quot; and the &amp;quot;Nighttime&amp;quot;. These are entirely different levels comparable to stage 1-a and 1-b. Harker must jump to various platforms and obstacles and defeat minor enemies throughout the levels. The end of a Nighttime level is usually guarded by a boss creature who must be defeated to progress.</resource>

The only way to transform back is to reach the end of the cave...

Bubble Bobble is a platform game, with each level being a single screen. The enemies must be cleared from a level to go to the next one. With one player controlling Bub and the other controlling Bob, the player can jump and collect items for points (such as fruit). The real power Bub and Bob have however is the ability to blow bubbles. These bubbles can be as platforms to leap on, or to trap enemies. Enemies trapped in a bubble must be popped by jumping into them, wherein they'll turn to fruit. Additionally, power-ups sometimes float by in bubbles. They include lightning, which flies out horizontally at enemies, and water, which drags the player and enemies straight down flowing over platforms. Taking too long to complete any level will summon Baron Von Blubba, who will float around the screen trying to destroy the player.</resource>

    <resource id="63f18984467b6d87d50c2a8863920b311bee8b94" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">The game is based on the Looney Tunes cartoon movies. Bugs Bunny falls asleep, and in his dream sees Yosemite Sam developing a robot called Gossamer. The robot disobeys the commands of his master and goes out of control. Now Bugs Bunny has to enter the TV world and to correct things, bringing order back to the lives of Looney Tunes inhabitants.

The game consists of several platform-based stages, each one having a different goal (guiding another character to a safe place, defeating a big monster, etc.) Bugs Bunny can jump and run quickly, as well as collect items and throw them at enemies.</resource>

Story and themes remain the same, but the game has unique levels and slightly different gameplay mechanics.

To save his girlfriend Minnie from the evil witch Mizrabel, Mickey Mouse must venture into the Castle of Illusion. Crossing six levels (including a magical forest, a toy land and a candy world), he must collect the gems of the rainbow in order to confront and defeat the witch.

Each level features unique obstacles, enemies and a final boss. The enemies can be defeated by jumping on top of them. An alternative way is to pick up objects lying around (like rocks in the forest or blue balls in the toy level) and throwing them at the enemies. Mickey's ability to pick up things and carry them around also leads to puzzle-oriented gameplay. By placing objects in the right spot and jumping off of them, he can get to areas otherwise out of reach. In some levels, he also has to collect keys to open doors. A unique type of object is the treasure chest - by jumping on top of one or throwing it, Mickey gets access to its contents, which might include extra lives, a health power-up or coins to collect for points.</resource>

You are given a mission briefing before you start which gives information on the suspect and what car they drive. Then you drive across the city without crashing into other cars, and catch up with the criminal's car. To arrest the suspects, you must keep bumping into their car until it is no longer functional. And you have to do this under a strict time limit. You can't afford to crash into cars or buildings or you waste time getting on the road again. 

However, once you've caught up with your suspect, you are given more time. Your car is also equipped with turbo boosts, which you can use to gain extra speed if you are way behind the criminal. Each arrest is based on a &amp;quot;suspicion&amp;quot;.</resource>

Enemies can be destroyed by either using the helicopter's standard weapon, or more powerful weapons that can be picked up throughout the levels. The main task of each level however, is picking up a certain number of hostages and taking them to your home base.</resource>

As you may remember, Chuck Rock had to rescue his girl, Ophelia from the bad dude Gary Gritter.  Well, he was successful in his efforts, and now Chuck and Ophelia are married.  Eventually, they have a son, named Junior. Chuck works in a factory, where he develops great skill at carving automobiles out of stone. A rival manufacturer becomes jealous of Chuck's abilities and kidnaps him.  Now it is up to Junior to rescue his dad!

The gameplay in this sequel is similar to the first game, but with some minor differences since you are playing as Junior, rather than Chuck. This is a side-scrolling platform game with occasional rock-moving puzzles thrown in. Unlike Chuck, Junior carries a club that gives his attacks further reach.

On his way through the levels, the kid can make use of a skateboard, but has to continue by foot if knocked off. Enemies can be defeated by kicks and flying kicks, energy is -not surprisingly- restored by collecting cans of a certain soft drink.

The game was released in Japan only.</resource>

    <resource id="94f34865822e262c3fd9ed9dea06ebfb356e6654" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Columns is loosely derived from Tetris, as it involves arranging falling blocks in such a way as to clear them. However, in columns they are groups of 3 same-size but varying color blocks, which must be arranged into sequences of 3 or more, either horizontally, vertically or diagonally. Sequences of 4 or 5 count for double or triple points, and diagonal sequences score the most. The real trick is to set up 'combos' - where one line causes other blocks to drop so as to create other lines.

As well as the normal game mode, there is also a 'flash' mode, in which the aim is simply to remove a particular block from the base of the pre-formed pile of bricks. The difficulty of this can be determined by increasing the number of complete rows which are already in place.</resource>

Trouble is, no one believes his tale of the planet he discovered! Your job is to help Linus make his way back to planet Earth so he can take some pictures to convince his friends. Gameplay consists of two parts, an adventure and arcade action. In adventure mode you can explore lands, find objects, and talk to people. Sentences can be constructed by using the pointer to select actions or objects on the screen (This is similar to the interface LucasArts used in games such as Maniac Mansion.) To reach many new locations involves the action mode, where you will need to cross treacherous landscapes and evade dangerous creatures. This portion resembles a side scrolling platform game. Once you've cleared an action sequence, you will not need to do so again if you decide to revisit a location. Whenever you wish you can receive a password allowing you to continue the game later from the same point.</resource>

    <resource id="64744f6dcf105bef81f748e6326cc25c57e71528" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">The continent of Tyramus has lived in peace for almost a century, thanks to the four elemental crystals of the kingdom of Arliel. However, peace is threatened by the invading armies of the Jyn Empire, led by Emperor Grym, who wants to use the four crystals to rule over Tyramus. Fortunately, Princess Iris can escape with one of the crystals and now the player has to protect her and the crystal and somehow find a way to drive back the hordes of Jyn.

Gameplay in Crystal Warriors is quite similar to Shining Force. The player fights in turn-based battles controlling different characters like fighters, healers, rangers and mages, all with different strengths and skills. Whenever two units engage in battle, they enter a duel mode lasting for up to two turns. In this mode the player can choose between four commands: &amp;quot;battle&amp;quot; (attack), &amp;quot;retreat&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;spell&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;monster&amp;quot;. While the first three commands are quite self-explanatory, the &amp;quot;monster&amp;quot; command is interesting. Whenever a non-human enemy is defeated, it can be tamed and be used in battles. While most monsters do not have many HP they can serve as good attackers for physically weak characters or take some hits in order to protect his master.
In-between battles the player can visit towns to rest, buy weapons and spells or recruit new party members.</resource>

Deep Duck Trouble is a platform game where you play as Donald Duck.  You must make your way through four different areas of the island - the jungle, an inlet, a volcano, and a valley - and defeat bosses at the end of each area.  Donald can defeat enemies by jumping on their heads.  He can also defeat them by kicking bricks which will may then hit his enemies.  Donald's trademark temper also comes into play: if he eats a chili pepper, he will become furious and plough through anything in his way, whether it be bricks or enemies!</resource>

But just before, Ahriman managed to send into the world his most horrifying servant: the dragon Zahhark. Years have passed, Zahhark was defeated by the descendants of Jamseed, but its own descendants continued menacing the kingdom of Shanadar. Many generations later, you, the young Prince of Shanadar, has to confront the evil. Zahhark's offsprings plan to destroy the kingdom, and the Prince must first seek aid in a neighboring country, accompanied by a beautiful Princess, by the Genie from a lamp, and other friends.

This is a traditional Japanese-style RPG. You control the Prince and his party members, visiting various locations, buying and finding items, and fighting random enemies and bosses in a turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective.</resource>

&amp;quot;Devilish&amp;quot; is different from other paddle games by letting you play with two paddles. The lower one behaves just like a usual paddle - you use it to prevent the ball from dropping down. The upper one can move and turn, allowing you to hit the ball from different angles and from different parts of the screen. You advance through levels by destroying bricks and enemies, going up until the level boss enemy appears.</resource>

It features Ronald McDonald, mascot of the McDonald's fast-food chain. The game was only released in Japan, though curiously if the player inserts the cart into a western Game Gear, it will be translated into English, revealing a unused title in the process - Ronald in the Magical World.

The game has many similarities to the Sega Mega Drive game, McDonald's Treasure Land Adventure, though the gameplay, story and level design is slightly different. Some of the music is shared between the two, however.</resource>

    <resource id="e91bf99d4d5458f8fa4f8acac66a7ec68b7ee17c" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Dragon Crystal is a dungeon crawler with RPG elements, along the lines of classics such as Rogue or Nethack. Without relying on a story, the game throws you into a randomly generated world which you should explore carefully - and most importantly, where you must survive! The complex, maze-like levels reveal their structure only after you cover the corresponding map areas. Your goal in each level is to reach a teleporter which will take you to the next one. There are also a lot of random items scattered around - weapons, armor, money, and food. Money allows you to continue the game if you die, food prevents you from starving. The enemies are visible on screen, and you fight them in a fast-paced turn-based combat, moving around and pressing direction arrows to strike with the equipped weapon. You are always accompanied by an egg which will eventually grow up to be a dragon if you have leveled up enough.</resource>

You control a little character whose main attack comes from his disembodied head. Yes, years before Rayman appeared, we already had a hero who used detachable appendages to attack his enemies.

Rather than the traditional power-ups, Dynamite Headdy enables you to swap your head for different kinds – such as heads that heal you or heads that stick on to walls. You use your head in order to climb up on platforms as well, as you can grab hold of things with it, and on certain stages of the Mega Drive/Genesis version it is used to turn the game into a side-scrolling shooter, as you gain a propeller, jet, or bird head. Basically, Dynamite Headdy is just a traditional platformer at heart.</resource>

Unfortunately, it turns out that the Vortex Queen followed it to the Earth and eventually destroyed the Asterite. All the world's oceans are threatened, and actually already doomed.

In order to restore the Asterite and finally defeat the Vortex Queen, Ecco will have to confront once again the tides of time, which have split into two possible futures, the regular one and the dark one dominated by the Vortex Queen.

Ecco: The Tides of Time features even better graphics than its predecessor, and introduces a new gameplay mode in which the camera follows the dolphin from behind instead of from the side.

The storyline is actually deeper that one may think by looking at the box illustration. As Ecco, you are the only dolphin who managed to escape from a giant whirlpool which sucked down your entire pod. The five shining stars on your forehead show that you are the chosen one to save them. But that task will be not be an easy one, as you will have to travel through time and space with the Atlantean time machine, and meet the mystical Asterite in order to defeat the Vortex Queen.</resource>

Holyfield is the only licensed boxer, the rest are fictitious. Rather than a fanciful approach like Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!!, the developers went for a more strategic sim. Differently from its Genesis counterpart, the game is played from a first or third person point of view, with the fighters facing each other directly. The player can choose to see the fight from his or from the opponent's point of view (&amp;quot;through his eyes&amp;quot;).

Players can either play a quick exhibition match or fight their way through the Career mode, using a created boxer to work their way up the 15-boxer ranking list until they fight Holyfield himself. During character creation, players can choose the fighter's head, color of skin, trunks and hair, physical and mental attributes. The physical attributes are dominant hand, power, speed, recovery and stamina. The mental attributes are style (brawler, dancer, boxer and dodger), killer instinct (low, medium or high) and favorite punches (jabs, straights or hooks aimed at head or torso, one for each hand). Between matches, career mode offers various exercises to assign the boxer to improve his stats.

The players can choose the view mode (normal or reverse), three kinds of control schemes, round length (up to four minutes) and fight length (up to 12 rounds).

There are two modes of play available: &amp;quot;Arcade&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Grand Prix&amp;quot;. In both of these modes you complete a certain number of laps (4, 8, or 12) and select which circuit that you want to race on. The circuits include San Marino, France, Britain, Germany, Italy, Portugal, Japan, and Australia. Some circuits are easy, while some are difficult. 

There are slight differences between the two modes. For instance, &amp;quot;Arcade&amp;quot; allows you to select the circuit in any order that you like, whereas &amp;quot;Grand Prix&amp;quot; only allows you to fine-tune your car before starting a race. You also need to race a circuit in the order that they appear on the circuit selection screen, but you can skip a track if you want. 

F1 is a 1-2 player game, meaning that if you have another player handy, you can compete against each other.</resource>

    <resource id="36dc6aab7575a795c37351af7a28fab9b9d099eb" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">The game that started the best-selling series licensed by football's world governing body, this first installment in the long running series used a dimetric (colloquially known as &amp;quot;isometric&amp;quot;) viewpoint, previously unusual in football games but quickly imitated by several titles. The televisual presentation, one of the unique points of the early EA Sports titles, with hosts introducing the matches, was another thing making the game stand out from a market dominated by Sensible Soccer and Kick Off games.

Based on international teams (with fictional player names), their abilities in each skill area rated out of 10 to give the player an overall impression of how good they are. The options available follow the standard set: fouls and offsides can be toggled on and off, the match length can be set, and if the timer operates  continuously, or only while the ball is in play. Gameplay privileges quick runs, short passes and blistering shots outside the penalty box, and set pieces are controlled by moving a box into the target area for the ball, and then passed, lobbed or kicked directly. On the tactical side, formations can be selected, with 5 different strategies also available (although not all of these combinations make sense) as can the team Coverage - the areas which defenders, midfielders and strikers cover.</resource>

It was hailed as the first really successful FIFA release, and opened the way for yearly revisions of the concept.

There were a number of factors that made FIFA96 stand out from the crowd of other football sims. Firstly, the game's commentary was revolutionary at the time -- the renowned British commentator John Motson comments all the incidents and happenings on the pitch in real-time. The ambient commentary is varied, and systems with more than the minimum memory level get extra commentary phrases.

The Virtual Stadium technology has numerous pre-defined camera angles. The game even has a SVGA mode for better-than-minimum system

FIFA96 boasts eleven leagues from all around the world, ranging from the unknown players of the Malaysian league to the celebrated stars of the English and Italian leagues. 59 International teams are also featured, and it's possible to match the teams you want to against each other through friendlies, or you can also choose to play domestic tournaments or International ones such as the World Cup. If you're not satisfied with the composition of the various teams, you can create your own dream team through the custom team creator.</resource>

Enemies are all simple geometric shapes with smiley faces on them. Although the graphics are simple, they allow for full freedom of movement, not unlike Wolfenstein 3-D.

There are two modes of play. First there is a single player mode in which your goal is to find the exit to each level.  There are 70 mazes in this mode. The second mode is the multiplayer arena. For the Game Boy: up to 4 Game Boys can be linked together in this mode.</resource>

That’s why you have infiltrated his factory. Now you must manipulate the conveyor belts skillfully to deliver the correct product to the right person waiting outside, but you have only a limited amount of time. Unfortunately, thugs with bats or even guns patrol the factory. Your only weapon against these security guards is a battle cry that temporarily stuns them, but not for too long.

Factory Panic consists of four rounds, and each round consists of eight stages. Before a stage starts, the game tells you how many people are waiting in line and what product they are waiting for. Rounds one and three are played in “Switch Mode”: step on different switches to rotate associated sections of the conveyor belt. If you get off the switch, the section rotates back to its initial position. One switch may affect more than one section. Since you can only step on one switch at a time, you have to bustle quite a bit in later stages. Rounds two and four are played in “Bridge Mode”: remove and install small bridges between the belts to control the flow of products.

If a person gets an unwanted product, the time remaining on the timer will decrease. Sometimes, the belt carries special items, e.g. a megaphone that makes your scream attack more powerful, or a weight that can be placed on a switch.</resource>

The most technically-advanced of Dizzy's adventure games in many ways, it was the only one to feature actual scrolling rather than a flick-screen system, the only one not to be released for the 8 bit computers the character originated on, the only one to originate on a console, as well as featuring many mini-games, such as Bubble Dizzy and an Operation Wolf clone. 

Gameplay involves walking Dizzy through the levels, picking up objects and using them to solve simple puzzles. There are plenty of tests of arcade skill along the way as well, as gaps must be jumped and baddies avoided - starting with a limited number of lives, the player can earn more by completing Theodore's puzzle. Before rescuing Daisy the player must capture all stars that unlock the gates of the tower.

A full range of punches and jabs are available, with full round-by-round scoring from the judges. You can choose from 3-12 rounds, and there are 2 camera views as well as an automatic switch option.

You can play simple exhibition matches or tournaments, or launch into a career mode. In this you start at the bottom of the world rankings, and must reach the top by beating the game's players, who other than George are all fictitious boxers with varying strengths and weaknesses. The coach gives advice before each fight to help highlight weaknesses in your play. There are passwords for each round.</resource>

There are 6 distinct game modes, allowing for single exhibition matches as well as full seasons on the playoffs. There is also a Home Run Derby mode, allowing the player to pelt the ball out of the ground for points. 

You can choose pitchers and batters, based on their statistics and form. Bowling options are set to define the delivery, with fastballs and curveballs as well as more precise setting of pace and height. Fielding is optional - it's best to leave this to the computer at first You can always alter the infield and outfield depth and shift.</resource>

Fray can only use her staff, which works as a ranged weapon, casting projectiles. By pressing down the action button, it is possible to increase the size and the power of the projected missile. With the exception of towns, the screen scrolls vertically when Fray moves forward. Like in most shooters of this type, Fray receives damage when she touches an enemy or hit by its projectile attack. Fray visits towns on the way, where she can buy weapons, armor, potions, and magical spells.</resource>

It confiscates a horde of planes and warships, and as a UN loyalist, it is your job to shoot them down. Solving starvation and disease can wait, apparently.

The game is split into 8 stages, which are split into sub-stages over land and sea, each of which has a strict time limit, and a target number of planes to shoot down. They take place from behind your plane, which can be controlled with ‘up’ referring to ‘climb’ or ‘dive’, depending on player preference. You are armed with 10 missiles as well as standard weapons. The plane can survive a few hits, so watch the damage report as it goes from red to black. 

Fail to complete a section in the time limit and you use up a continue, but the amount of planes previously shot down is not reset, making the second attempt easier Chase HQ style. As you destroy enemies you gain access to better planes, and the rank reported at the end of the game improves – this is also dependent on the skill level you play at.</resource>

As usual, your task is to exterminate level upon level of nasties with your space ship. The usual Aleste powerup systems remains fairly intact. You still have powerup pods which release P capsules for upgrading your main weapon. On the other hand, secondary weapon upgrades are no longer released from ground bases, but from another type of flying pods. When you start out, your secondary weapon is a laser, which can later be replaced with powerups ranging from split fire to napalm rockets and target seeking power balls. Both primary and secondary weapons are in constant use, since only button 2 is used for firing both weapons at once. Due to the smaller screen estate of the Game Gear, the sprites are larger and the playfield more constrained, for which the game compensates somewhat by introducing multidirectionally scrolling sections.</resource>

The player takes control of a professional motorcycle rider in 15 different courses around the world, go up against over a dozen different opponents in an attempt to win the race and advance to the next level.

Players must avoid from hitting other riders to keep from wrecking their bike.  If a player bumps another racer from behind, they can run off to the side of the road or lose control and send their rider flying through the air.  There are four different game modes to choose from such as Exhibition and Grand Prix.

Two friends can also go head-to-head using the Link Cable.</resource>

Unlike most other platform games of its time, Garfield boasted completely unique art on each of its six levels, both for tile art and character costumes. The levels are inspired by classic movies, but given a Garfield twist, like &amp;quot;Catsablanca&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;The Curse of Cleofartra.

Your task on each level is to use a number of gears of one of 3 different sizes to ensure that all the pegs are linked together. All this has to be completed before the engine overheats.

Making life harder are two creatures with the peculiar name ‘Poffins’. One of these goes around removing pegs, and the other causes the engine to overheat further. They can be shot out of the way, or have gears placed over them to stop them.

There’s also a bonus round, which is a fruit machine, only with cogs and other things from the game rather than fruit.</resource>

    <resource id="7f90138ba3e48ad16c1fcf845f7c2405d2a49fbe" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">The Master System and Game Gear versions of George Foreman's KO Boxing are fairly identical to the other versions in concept, but there are a few notable changes. The game is a reworking of the Master System title James 'Buster' Douglas Knockout Boxing, not to be confused with the Genesis title with the same name, which is entirely different.

Just like the other versions players are cast as George Foreman to go through a series of boxing matches against different opponents to win the championship title belt. Compared to the other titles, these versions have new opponents and show the boxers from the side. Players can move left or right in the ring to avoid punches. Other moves including blocking, and left and right punches that can be varied into jabs and crosses. Matches can last up to ten rounds and when no regular or technical knock-out occurs, the winner is based on the jury's points, provided between the rounds. During knock-out phases, no buttons need to be pressed to get the boxer back to his feet. At the start of the game, a slow or fast speed for the gameplay can be selected.

Each match the player's boxer can use three super punches. These need to be charged and then unleashed when near an opponent. It sends them straight to the back of the ring, a dangerous area as it is easy to keep punching them into the ropes. Health is slightly restored during the intermission and after each won match the player is awarded skill points to be distributed over three characteristics. Matches for two players are supported.</resource>

A player can play as Godzilla or similar monsters (kaiju), like Anguirus, and Fire Rodan. Should players want to support humanity they can play as the G-Force, a human defense force. Humans have monster killing tools such as, tanks, artillery and planes. Some monsters are unplayable enemies and both sides will have the chance to fight against them.

On the map, the game is a typical war strategy. The player can move units on the map, and attack enemies. Battles have their own screen and animations. The fighting is quite arcade-like and simple, functioning similarly to fighting games. When all units have used their actions points a turn ends.

Godzilla: Kaijuu no Daishingeki has four maps, and an extra secret level.</resource>

    <resource id="f8f7f1fa5c53afc19a038e92e9c7333415c61d91" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">In this game you play the role of a surfer called Greendog who discovers a gold pendant while out surfing. Unwittingly he puts the pendant on and discovers it wont come off. A bikini clad girl tells him that the pendant was made by the Aztecs long ago, and that they cursed it so that whoever wears it will be attacked by any animal that comes near them. Worst of all the person wearing it is unable to surf. The only way Greendog can lift the curse and remove the pendant is to find the six pieces of Aztec treasure and put them all together and the only knowledge of the whereabouts of the treasure is stamped on the back of the pendant.

The gameplay involves you getting from the left end of the level to the right while fighting off wild animals with your trusty Frisbee and using your athletic skills to jump over platforms.

The armies of Lord Halley are launching attacks on planet Earth. You are the last chance for Earth, piloting a craft specially developed to engage these hordes. You must fight your way through their defenses to the final goal, the alien base. The final battle is about to commence!

Halley Wars is a vertical scrolling shooter. The game has 6 stages set in locations in space such as, above planets or in asteroid fields. There are end of levels bosses at the end of each stage each with their own weaknesses. There are power-ups, which can be picked up along the way when you shoot particular asteroids or satellites. These upgrade your weapon strength, speed, add explosive pods and shields.

Where the game stood out was, there are comets that need to be destroyed on your journey. Each comet and ship that you don’t shoot makes it to earth and does some damage there. Comets do more damage than the enemy ships do. If Earths damage level reaches 100% the game is over. For every 2000 points you score, 1% of Earths damage is repaired.</resource>

    <resource id="48ef4c93153b5165821e922504504f31eb9a7487" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Head Buster is a so-called ”future sports” game about robots. On a top-down, horizontally scrolling playfield, armed robots are moved around in a manner similar to Super Robot Taisen strategy games, albeit without many of the refinements of that series.

Each game starts at the shop, where robots on your team are bought and equipped according to your tastes and finances. After that, the game begins in the robot arena, blue team against red team in one corner each. The goal is not explicitly to destroy the robots of the opposing team, but to destroy their base. In order to reach their base, and to prevent them from reaching yours, a certain amount of fighting is required. Each turn is split into a movement phase and a combat phase, and since actions of both sides are only executed when a phase is over, you cannot know when moving how close you will get to your opponents.

Robots are available in three basic classes, from light to heavy, but can be modified with new movement units (different terrain squares have different movement properties), better armour and new weapons. Different weapons have both different strength and different ranges, as well as a limited supply of bullets. Reloading is done during the combat phase, but requires that your robot stays out of combat during that turn. Different sensors and command units can also be added, giving the robots better aim or particular abilities such as dodging, shielding and healing.</resource>

During this time, burglars attempt to break in, and Kevin must foil them.

Playing as Kevin, you start off on his trusty sled, but the main job is to get to the house and make it burglar-proof. This involves setting traps throughout the house. Useful objects such as a Crossbow, Wire and Pepper can be combined to make fiendish weaponry. You must also lock up any valuables you find, to avoid the family losing them.</resource>

Tinker Bell takes Peter back to Neverland where he must again become Pan and reclaim his children.

This particular interpretation is a side-scrolling action game, in which players must hack their way past Hook's denizens through 11 levels.  These include forests, icy regions, and towns which Peter will have to jump, climb, and swim through. Magic items such as apples and pixie dust can be collected for special powers. When enemies are attacked, they simply put their hands up in surrender rather than dying, so as to make the game more child-friendly.</resource>

This makes for a four-level arcade adventure combining climbs, exploration (with several routes through each level, and some traps) and puzzles. Indy is armed with his trusty whip to fight off foes, but can also get involved in hand-to-hand combat. The first level takes place in caves underneath Colorado, before you reach a moving circus train strewn with traps, a Zeppelin which is full of guards and ladders, and then Castle Grunwald in Austria.

Itchy &amp; Scratchy, from The Simpsons, are a cat and mouse cartoon duo. Itchy the mouse and Scratchy the cat exist only to find new and creative ways to attack and kill one another. As the latest cartoon adventures appear on the television, the violence spreads to brand new places.

Itchy &amp; Scratchy is a single player platform side-scroller. The player controls Itchy, the mouse, and must defeat Scratchy, the cat, with a variety of weapons. Itchy caries a default mallet, but can pick up additional weapons on particular levels. Each of the seven levels takes place in a different fictional location and is designed as a maze of doors and platforms. After defeating Scratchy, he usually will return with a special contraption to attack Itchy, and must therefore be defeated again.</resource>

Pond has been armed with an Inspector Gadget-style stretch device, which he can use to view higher areas or claw onto ceilings so as to slide across them.

The gameplay takes place across worlds themed around particular types of toys, such as sporting goods, candy and aircraft. The levels scroll sideways, although a small amount of vertical movement is included. On each level Pond must collect 2 penguins and reach the exit, although there are usually multiple exits and lots of secret areas to explore. After completing each pair of two worlds (each of which has three sub levels), a boss must be faced.</resource>

He must fight his way through a forest, a ruined city, underground colonies, a roof-top battle, and finally the prison ship in which the Megantan leader is held.

The gameplay is similar to the original, consisting of running, jumping and attacking, with a very dynamic central character. The laser gun can be used while standing still; moving attacks with the sword are still possible, with the two weapons combining similarly to the Switchblade games. Tokens can be collected, which will turn you into a robot to face the end-of-level enemies if enough are collected.

    <resource id="27f5f3729f6dcf23a833c8cf5ea6e7540106a13a" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Judge Dredd is a platform action game based on the British comic book character of the same name and the 1995 movie that tarnished that name.  The game was a multi system release so it fits the standard console jump/shoot/duck formula although it does add some unique twists such as wounding enemies so that they surrender and can be arrested.

The initial levels follow the plot of the movie with futuristic lawman Judge Dredd framed and sent to the Aspen penal colony from which he must escape and prove his innocence.  Following the fight at the top of the Statue of Liberty that ended the film, the game continues on with levels and characters inspired by the comic book culminating with a battle against the Dark Judges on Deadworld.</resource>

Although most of the main elements remain the same, the most noticeable differences are in level design and some missing items.

The player controls Mowgli in his journey to the human village. Mowgli will swing on and climb vines, run and jump while facing enemies such as coconut-throwing monkeys, snakes and vampire bats. To fight them, Mowgli can throw bananas in eight directions. He'll also find upgrades and weapons such as boomerangs inside banana bunches. There are some boss fights with main characters of the movie, such as the snake Kaa.

The objective of each of the 10 time-limited levels (or &amp;quot;scenes&amp;quot;) is to collect gems scattered around them. Collecting certain amounts of gems grant access to bonus levels. The player starts the game with 4 lives and 1 continue.

    <resource id="87b999c179ad1a8e4b5e29df7cf48a19254702c3" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">One of many games based on the 1993 blockbuster Jurassic Park, the version for Sega's 8-bit systems combines side-scrolling shooting action and platforming levels.

In each of the five stages of the game, one escaped dinosaur species must be recaptured. Each level begins with a side-scrolling driving section. Dinosaurs attack the car and must be fend off by firing at them with a crosshair. If the player survives long enough, a boss battle against an especially powerful dinosaur follows.

After the completion of the driving section the level continues with a platform section. The player must jump, duck and climb to survive moving lifts, floors that will crumble under his feet, environmental hazards like acid drops, steam leaks or giant boulders and more. Dinosaurs will of course also stand in the way, but can be defeated by using several weapons: a rifle, a grenade launcher and hand grenades. Navigating the often maze-like levels will lead to the dinosaur that must be captured and a corresponding boss fight.

The first four levels (featuring a Velociraptor, Pteranodon, Triceratops and Brachiosaurus) can be tackled in any order, but the final level, featuring the Tyrannosaurus Rex, is only unlocked when the others have been completed.</resource>

This makes putting the pieces together to form the overall picture both more interesting and more difficult, since the player can not analyse each piece at his own pace when the entire puzzle is moving about. Pieces also need to be flipped around both on the X and Y axis in order to fit together.

The game has 7 puzzles, some of which are carried over from the earlier versions but mostly new ones designed with Sega characters. Due to the small screen, the pieces are not kept in a box at the bottom of the screen as in the original Kinetic; instead they are all placed out on the grid already, in a random order. Each puzzle can be played in three different modes:

Mode 1 lets the player swap pieces around as he likes. Mode 2 lacks one piece and lets the player slide pieces around as in a sliding puzzle. Mode 3 lets the player slide entire rows and columns around in the puzzle. The two second modes call for much more thought when solving the moving puzzles.</resource>

One day, a terrible shadow crept over the kingdom, threatening the lives of its inhabitants. The king's adviser said the only way to stop the shadow would be for the king himself to travel out and to seek the cure. But the cowardly king Pete preferred to stay in the castle, and sent a simple laundry boy named Mickey instead! 

As Mickey Mouse, you will travel through various levels in this platform game. Mickey shoots an unlimited amount of little balls on the enemies, can jump, climb on stairs, hang on ropes, and perform other tricks. Mickey can also pick up items and put them in another place, for example to access a higher level or to break a treasure chest open.</resource>

You are in control not of any individual Lemming, but of a cross-hair, which can be moved over any of the Lemmings. Along the bottom are a selection of functions which can be assigned to a Lemming, including climbing, floating and bashing. You must click to select the appropriate function, then click on the Lemming to activate it. Each level has a different range of skills on offer, a different amount of Lemmings, and a different percentage target in order to progress.</resource>

His father is the current King of the Savannah and the young prince is able to frolic the lands at will; jumping on and around other subjects of this animal kingdom. When Simba's father, King Mufasa, is killed and his evil brother Scar takes over the kingdom, Simba is banished from the lands of his birthright and has to grow up fast, honing his skills, for the day of his return.

The Lion King, based on the famous Disney movie, is a platform game where you control Simba - initially as a young cub, and later as an adult lion. The plot of the game follows the plot of the movie. Each of the levels represents a part of the movie. 

As young Simba, you can fight various beasts, such as lizards, by jumping on them. You can also roar to scare some creatures into submission, though every time you roar, you have to wait for your &amp;quot;roar meter&amp;quot; to charge. 

As an adult lion, you can still roar and jump, but now you fight enemies by slashing at them with your claws (if you're skillful enough, you can also grab them and toss them off the screen). 

The game features no in-game save function, and it needs to be replayed from the beginning every time.

There was also Satan being the main villain and final boss, and an entirely different intro where Skeleton-T, Sasori Man, and Suketoudara make a cameo.</resource>

Mado Monogatari I is a puzzle/RPG mixture. Featuring characters and puzzles from Puyo Puyo games, it is set in a 3D dungeon which you explore from first-person perspective. Combat takes place on a platform, and is a mixture of turn-based and real time styles. Enemies attack you even if you wait, but you have time to perform your moves. You should hold down buttons and press direction arrows to execute various magic spells.

Now she is sixteen and she can still remember the spells she has learned long time ago. One day she meets a fresh young man who without any apparent reason casts a powerful spell on her. Arle finds herself locked in a prison cell. Grabbing the key, she runs out of the cell, only to find out she is imprisoned in a huge dungeon populated by vicious monsters...

Mado Monogatari II retains the gameplay system of the previous game. You navigate Arle through first-person 3D dungeons. Enemy encounters are random. During the turn-based battles, you can attack only with various types of magic. Since you don't see your own hit points, the key to winning the battles is to choose appropriate spells against various types of monsters.

One day Arle goes out for a walk and meets a mysterious woman. The woman tells her that she will avenge the death of Satan, whom Arle has defeated in the end of her first adventure. The woman then summons the awful monster Minotaur. Arle has no choice but to run away, and she falls down through a trap into a dungeon. It appears she is now alone there, because the first creature she meets in this dungeon is a frosh king. He asks Arle to use her magical powers to defeat the monsters in the dungeon and to find a way to escape from Minotaur and the mysterious woman.

The gameplay of Mado Monogatari III is similar to the two previous games. The entire game is viewed from first person perspective. You navigate Arle through maze-like 3D dungeons, encountering randomly appearing monsters and fighting them in turn-based combat. In battles you can't attack physically, only use various kinds of magic or items.

    <resource id="c812bddeb03c244c9412a93b5487a097daa96d67" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">This game is based on the anime and manga by manga artist CLAMP.

In the land of Cephiro, the world was kept in peace and harmony by the wishes of Princess Emauraude, the Pillar of Balance. But the evil priest, Lord Zagato, has kidnapped Emauraude, and Cephiro is being invaded by deadly beasts. If this continues, Zagato will gain complete control of Cephiro! The only ones who can stop him are the legendary Magic Knights...

And those Magic Knights are three young girls from Earth. Hikaru Shidou, Umi Ryuuzaki, and Fuu Hououjii have been plucked from modern-day Tokyo and brought to Cephiro by Emauraude, and they're the only ones who can defeat Zagato...as the Magic Knights!

This interpretation of the manga story is a traditional Japanese-style RPG. The player controls the three main heroines as a party; each one uses different weapons and learns various skills. Typically for the genre, the party roams the top-down world, visits towns, descends into dungeons, chats with non-playable characters, and fights randomly appearing enemies in turn-based style.</resource>

The object in each round is to go through the labyrinth until the player reaches the princess (or the princess reaches the player). The player can break blocks, climb ladders, go through portals. There are also hazards to avoid, like red spikes and enemies.

Breaking blocks is the most important gameplay element. Breaking a block causes the column of blocks above it to fall one place down. The player must use this block breaking ability to change the labyrinth and create a way to the princess. 

The short introduction sequence shows the back story: A beautiful princess fell in love with you! And you fell in love with her too... The wizard of forest &amp;quot;Popil&amp;quot; shut her in his labyrinth. Please save her!

In 60 levels you have to rescue as many passengers (dubbed the Dim Passengers) as possible. At the beginning the passengers fall through a tube in the level. Similar to Lemmings you have to find a way for the passengers to the exit of the level. In order to do so, you must blast hindrances such cargo boxes and bulkheads with bombs or, when no bombs are left, reposition the boxes with a crane. There are also conveyor belts in the levels. If the belt moves in the wrong way, the passengers either can't use it or may even be transported to their dooms, being dropped off into water, fire or steam jets. You can usually choose the direction of the belts by pulling a lever.</resource>

Secondary weapons are long-range weapons (pistols, bombs etc.) with limited ammunition. The game features 5 Rounds divided into 3 stages. At the end of each stage, a boss must be defeated.</resource>

The Game Gear version of Mega Man is an original game created by developer Freestyle, using Mega Man 4 and Mega Man 5 for the NES as its basis.  Mega Man is able to perform his slide that was introduced in Mega Man 3, as well as call his dog, Rush, for assistance.  He can also charge up his buster for a more powerful shot.

Players can initially select any stage from a choice of four: Stone Man, Napalm Man, Bright Man and Star Man.  After defeating these four bosses, players progress to Dr. Cossack's fortress, which contains Wave Man and Toad Man as its bosses.  After they are defeated, it's off to the final confrontation with Dr. Wily himself.</resource>

    <resource id="c8802d1e5c6664b2cdae5bb894268e38746de2da" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">One night, as Mickey (or Minnie) lay in bed reading a book of fairy tales, he started to wonder how it would be to live in a far off land, in a magic castle. As he fell asleep, he woke up in the Kingdom of Beanwick, which is constantly tormented by earthquakes. Then, he offers his help to solve the mystery behind those earthquakes.

Mickey's Ultimate Challenge is a puzzle game in which the player chooses either Mickey or Minnie to play with. They'll find five characters from the Disney's universe in the kingdom, and will be prompted to help them in several tasks.

Each task is a different puzzle, given by a specific character. Daisy, for instance, will ask help to clean the castle's paintings hanging on a wall. The task is in fact a memory game, where Mickey or Minnie must clean the pictures matching pairs. After completing one task, they'll receive a gift.

After completing all tasks, Mickey or Minnie must trade the gifts they won with the right characters. For instance, after finishing Goofy's task, they will receive his hammer. The player must then guess who among the other characters would like to receive that hammer.

Giving the right items to the right characters will allow Mickey or Minnie access to the last puzzle and character.</resource>

    <resource id="0ba7fefcc70509f0a2efa06fdadd6774bd2a1293" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">If you're bored of racing Formula 1 cars, rally cars or MotoGP bikes in their natural habitats, the Micro Machines series could be for you. It involves racing miniatures representing particular vehicle types across a particular terrain found around the house. The Sports Cars race on the desktop, 4x4s in the sandpit, Formula 1 cars on a snooker table, and so on.

These levels were packed with variation. The Snooker tables has the track painted on, although this is open to deviation (as are most levels), and had you racing through the pockets and across the rim of the table. Tanks raced as well, with the chance of shooting out your opponent if they got directly in front of you. The desktop levels include binders to jump across, pencil-sharpeners to avoid, and lots of visual jokes in the open homework.

Viewed from overhead with small graphics, the races include up to 4 cars. In one player challenge mode you race through the 21 tracks in a set order, selecting your 3 opponents as you go along (adding a fair amount of strategy - ideally you should aim to eliminate the better CPU cars early on), eliminating one after every third race (assuming that you can finish in the top 2 of a race within your 3 lives). If you win 3 races in a row without using a continue you get a time-trial race which can earn you an extra life.

The real innovation of the game was in the multiplayer modes. You started with 4 points each, and when one car gets far enough ahead to force the other car off-screen, the slider moves in their favour. Once it reached the end (which involved beating them 4 times more than they beat you) you win the level, although if 3 laps were completed, the person leading at that point is declared the winner - with a sudden death play off if scores are level. 9 of the tracks are available in this mode, although you can also play this Head to Head system as a 1-player game across all the tracks.

Humans lived on one end, tending to the land and living relatively mundane lives and demons lived on the other, strong with magical powers and willing to prove their dominance, though humans were rarely targets of their aggression. The world Moldoria acted as the boundary that seperated the two races and allowed each other to co-exist mutually. However, one day, while two mortals of the quaint village of Koizun, Nabal and Milia, are running simple errands and investigating the eastern woods, they witness a demon running through the woods. 

Uncertain of what this could mean, the two decide not to alert the townsfolk and investigate where the demon went, which is a hole in the woods. Milia stands watch while Nabal checks inside, but when he returns, Milia is abducted by a demon. Nabal alerts the town and his father, who goes out to search for Milia, but when he fails to return, Nabal decides to go himself, which is the start of his adventure as he interacts with various supporting characters while finding out why the demons kidnapped Milia and why the demons are now on the move.</resource>

Shang was accompanied by Prince Goro, a warrior of the Shokan race (a four armed half-human/half-dragon). Knowing that if ten tournaments in a row were won by the Outworld champion, the Earth Realm would be conquered by evil and fall into darkness, Shang entered Goro in the tournament and had him defeat the great Kung Lao. Goro has been  reigning supreme as the undefeated fighting champion for five hundred years now. As the last tournament required draws near, Raiden, Thunder God and protector of the Earth Realm, enacts a plan to tip the scales in the humans favor, Seven fighters step into the arena on Shang Tsung's mysterious island: Shaolin warrior Liu Kang, Special Forces operative Sonya Blade, the mercenary thug Kano, fame-seeking actor Johnny Cage, the ice wielding Lin Kuei warrior Sub-Zero and his undead adversary Scorpion, and Raiden himself.

Mortal Kombat is a side-scrolling 1 on 1 fighting game. Fighting is set as one on one kombat, allowing each player to perform a variety of punches, kicks, and special moves in order to defeat their opponent.  When the opponent faces their second round loss, the winner can perform a finishing move called a &amp;quot;Fatality&amp;quot; on the loser.  The Fatality is a move unique to each fighter that graphically kills the loser in a blood-soaked finale.

Mortal Kombat began its life as a 2-player arcade title. It is notable for its use of digitized actors to represent the game's fighters, as well as its use of copious amounts of blood during gameplay.</resource>

In order to revive his Queen Sindel, the emperor Shao Kahn used the Outworld Tournament from Mortal Kombat 2 as a diversion while his Shadow Priests revive his fallen Queen on Earth. Once enacted, the dimensional bridge between the two realms connects, allowing Kahn's extermination squads to invade and destroy Earth, and enslave the population's souls.

A small team of Raiden's &amp;quot;Chosen Warriors&amp;quot; survives the attack: Mortal Kombat champion Liu Kang and his ally Kung Lao, Special Forces agents Sonya Blade and Jax, the shaman Nightwolf, the riot cop Stryker, the nomadic Kabal, and former Lin Kuei warrior Sub-Zero, who has gone rogue from his clan. Facing the warriors are the mercenary Kano, cyber-ninjas Smoke, Sektor and Cyrax, Sheeva, a female Shokan, the sorcerer Shang Tsung, and Queen Sindel herself.

Mortal Kombat 3 brings new elements to the 2D fighting series: multi-level playfields, &amp;quot;Dial-A-Combo&amp;quot; attacks, a &amp;quot;Run&amp;quot; button to speed up the battles, and &amp;quot;Vs.&amp;quot; codes, which unlock new powers and abilities once both players enter a code sequence in pre-match-up screens. Also included are more stage fatalities and finishing moves as each warrior attempts to go one-on-one with the Centaurian enforcer Motaro, and Shao Kahn himself.

Mortal Kombat 3 is the last traditional one-on-one fighting game game in the series to feature motion-captured digitized graphics for its kombatants, and introduces online network play to the PC version.</resource>

The action is one-on-one as before, and famed for its high level of violence and blood (other than the sanitised Nintendo version). There are 5 difficulty levels and optional credits, as well as the usual two player mode including same character duels.

To win the main tournament, the player must beat each of the other human players, before taking on Shang Tsung, Kintaro and finally Shao Kahn. Players have a range of punches and kicks available, as well as flying kicks, uppercuts, roundhouses, and the special moves, which vary for each player. These include throws, uppercuts, long-distance bullets, bicycle kicks and a teleport feature.

    <resource id="9970e97792944f4006bf127e13e2c11837fd6701" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">In 1982, a sequel to the  incredibly popular Pac-Man was introduced in the form of his girlfriend, Ms. Pac-Man.  This sequel continued on the &amp;quot;eat the dots/avoid the ghosts&amp;quot; gameplay of the original game, but added new features to keep the title fresh.

Like her boyfriend, Ms. Pac-Man attempts to clear four various and challenging mazes filled with dots and ever-moving bouncing fruit  while avoiding Inky, Blinky, Pinky and Sue, each with their own personalities and tactics.  One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Ms. Pac-Man.

Ms. Pac-Man can turn the tables on her pursuers by eating one of the four Energizers located within the maze. During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Ms. Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points (ranging from 200, 400, 800 and 1600, progressively). The Energizer power only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghost's eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Ms. Pac-Man again.

Survive a few rounds of gameplay, and the player will be treated to humorous intermissions showing the growing romantic relationship between Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man, leading all the way up to the arrival of &amp;quot;Junior&amp;quot;.</resource>

Full performance statistics are automatically recorded. The play clock and 3-point line apply, but other rules are largely overlooked.</resource>

Gameplay is fast and action-packed, with few rules, no fouls, and deliberately unrealistic jamming. Players are rated on eight ability categories, from steals and blocks, to dunks and 3-pointers.

Up to four human players can take part, each always controlling a single player for their team, and AI for missing players. This allows for four players to face each other in teams of two, or for two players to team up against a third player with a CPU team-mate.</resource>

Whereas the usual Puyo Puyo gameplay is centred around beating an opponent by having a more skillful play technique, the puzzle mode (and all Nazo Puyo) games is a leisurly puzzle game where you have to fulfill a set goal on a screen already filled with a certain arrangement of Puyos.

These goals may be to simply eliminate all Puyos on-screen, to eliminate all Puyos of a certain colour, or to eliminate a certain number of Puyos at once. You may also be asked to do a &amp;quot;rensa&amp;quot;, or chain reaction, in a certain number of steps. A &amp;quot;rensa&amp;quot; is arranged by making so that if one set of four or more Puyos is eliminated, it will make neighbouring Puyos fall so that new combinations arise, and are eliminated. The fulfillment of the goals may be complicated by the fact that you are given only Puyos of a certain colour to work with.

The game has also an edit mode, where you can make your own puzzles given all the options described above.</resource>

    <resource id="ffe2ee91037016813d41f5c5323bdc1041cf00d7" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">One day, Arle (Aruru), the cute girl who is also the protagonist of the Puyo Puyo and Mado Monogatari games, decides that she shall have curry rice for dinner. She heads for the market, but all the market stalls are run by the usual crowd of baddies from Puyo Puyo. And they won't take cash! Instead, before they give her the necessary ingredients, she must solve the Puyo puzzles they have on offer.

The game starts out as a normal top-down RPG, where Arle can go from stand to stand and choose in which turn to clear the merchants' puzzles. The puzzles are played in the typical Nazo Puyo style, with a set field of existing Puyos which Arle must tackle given only a limited number of new Puyos. In order to clear a puzzle, Arle must fulfill a certain goal, such as clearing all Puyos of a certain colour, make chain reactions of a certain length, or eliminate only a certain number of Puyos (no more, no less). Luckily, she can see what Puyos are available for several drop in advance. If she fails to solve a puzzle, Arle can retry, but for each failure, she will lose health. Solving a puzzle makes her level up through the same system used in Mado Monogatari, with a ring of lights around the screen. Raising a level restores health. Will Arle ever be able to cook her curry?

The game also contains a &amp;quot;Toko Puyo&amp;quot; mode, which is the endless mode known from most regular Puyo Puyo games.

It is revealed that the doomed ninja is the father of Ryu Hayabusa. When Ryu learns of this, he embarks on a quest to find out who killed his father and why. This quest takes him to America to find an archaeologist with whom Ryu's father was working. From there, Ryu becomes embroiled in an evil, supernatural conspiracy involving a villain named Jaquio who has plans to use an ancient castle and some relics to unleash a terrifying evil upon the world.

Ninja Gaiden is a side scrolling game where Ryu the ninja can run, jump, and slash with his ninja sword. He can also attach to any vertical surface. Powerups are littered throughout the landscape that allow Ryu to toss fireballs and ninja stars, and perform other feats.

Ryu will battle through urban city settings, forests, jungles, snow covered castles, underground railroads, and ancient castles. A major feature in Ninja Gaiden are the cinematic scenes -- sometimes fullscreen -- through which the storyline unfolds.</resource>

Tengen developed a Sega Game Gear port, thought to be set for release around 1993. It was featured in some gaming magazines, as well as Summer CES 1993[2], but was quietly cancelled with no explanation. A prototype has since been found and dumped.

No other home versions Off the Wall were ever released (a PC Engine version was planned before also being cancelled), though a similar (but unrelated) Atari 2600 game was released in 1989 by Atari Corporation.</resource>

It's an ordinary evening, and Bruno's dad is working late at office. Reason enough for Bruno's vivid imagination to run riot, thinking that his dad has been kidnapped by aliens! Jelly babies, that fell from his father's pocket on the way to work, blaze a trail to the office. Now it's up to Bruno to fight his way through hordes of terrorizing toys, Ottifant-eating plants, tear through gloomy caverns of doom and cut across a perilous jungle - workaday objects and boringly normal settings as seen through kids' eyes - and rescue his dad!

The Ottifants for the SEGA Game Gear is a 2D side-scrolling platformer where the player controls Bruno through five worlds: starting with the house and the basement, through to the building site, the office and finally the jungle, whereas each world is in turn divided into three stages. Bruno's primary weapon is his trunk, which gives him the ability to blast enemies by firing sweets at them, or suck in objects like out-of-reach platforms or boxes by holding down the Fire-button. Furthermore, yellow, green and red lollies are spread throughout the stages. Gathering three of them activate one of Bruno's special skills and can - depending on the colour combination - transform the baby Ottifant into Superfant with the ability to fly, boost his speed with Speedy Shoes, give an extra Continue and more. 

Picking up jelly babies, blasting enemies and collecting papers gives points and raises Bruno's score up to a fixed value of 9,999 pts. There are several entrances to secret rooms hidden in the five worlds. But, unlike the Genesis-version, the rooms are quite small and basic and there is no 1,000 point reward by completing them. On the whole there are two different tunes backing your journey through the game: one for the stages and one for the boss enemies. The varied background music and sound effects of the Genesis-game are completely missing, as is one entire world: The Garden.</resource>

The three-click control method (the first to start the swing, the second setting power and over-swing, the third setting draw or fade) allowed for a multitude of different shots, and required a sense of timing. 

Four courses are included, one of them a fantasy 'links' course designed by the programmers. Some of the holes are fiendish, with bunkers, water hazards and trees, and the need to plan strategies to get the best approach to the green.

When playing a tournament there are 60 opponents, each representing top US golfers - ten of these appear with tactical advice for each hole.</resource>

Players can choose to either play in Tournament mode, Skins Play or learn the basics of the game in Practice mode.  

Players use a cursor on a top-down view of a map to determine the location as well as another view from behind the golfer to avoid various obstacles such as trees.  After selecting their location they can then use a meter to the bottom left to determine how much draw or fade will be put into the shot.  To hit the ball, the players presses the &amp;quot;B&amp;quot; button to start the power meter and hitting it again to stop.

Players must also adjust to changing wind and weather conditions during game play which will drastically change the outcome of their shot.  It features four-player capabilities using Gear-to-Gear links as well as a password feature.</resource>

    <resource id="e8aba579b5428fd6f91d1f27ca8a42a69cc9aa43" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Based on Namco's Japanese-only arcade puzzler Cosmo Gang the Puzzle, Pac-Attack is similar to many block-dropping puzzle games from the time, such as Puyo Puyo.

The objective of the game is to place ghosts and then, after three pieces (which can include one or two blocks as well), make Pac-Man eat as many ghosts as possible to try and clear up the game area. Pac-Man's directions are chosen at random between left or right, but as he goes moving on the game area (after you place him, of course), if he bumps against a block or a &amp;quot;wall&amp;quot; on the game area, he will change his direction. As with many block-dropping puzzlers, if a line of blocks and/or ghosts reaches the top, the game ends. However, by filling up a meter on the left of the game area, a fairy may appear that can clear approximately 6 or 7 lines with ghosts, but it only clears the ghosts, although the blocks that were on top of them will drop.

Also, like many puzzlers, it contains a versus mode against another human player. It's similar to the many versus modes of puzzle games: eat plenty of ghosts and your opponent will recieve many ghosts on his area.

The game also includes a Puzzle mode. It features 100 levels, in which you have to eat all ghosts with no more than 4 Pac-Men at least (the number reduces in certain levels), and, unlike the other modes, you can change Pac-Man's direction with the press of a button.

All of the handheld versions (including the one on Pac-Man Collection) lack the versus mode.</resource>

    <resource id="60e43994c3e316da6bd9a07be6fd3cfd71fa3df1" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">One of the most popular and influential games of the 1980's, Pac-Man stars a little, yellow dot-muncher who works his way around to clear a maze of the various dots and fruit which inhabit the board.

Pac-Man's goal is continually challenged by four ghosts: The shy blue ghost Bashful (Inky), the trailing red ghost Shadow (Blinky), the fast pink ghost Speedy (Pinky), and the forgetful orange ghost Pokey (Clyde).  One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Pac-Man.

Pac-Man can turn the tables on his pursuers by eating of the four Energizers located within the maze.  During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points.  This only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghost's eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Pac-Man again.

Survive a few rounds of gameplay, and be treated to humorous intermissions between Pac-Man and the ghosts.</resource>

The player starts by choosing one of three dragons, and from there must shoot at incoming enemies (although for most time, just avoiding incoming fire is an easier way to progress in the game). At the end of the level (each with two bosses), a password appears and allows the game to be resumed later.</resource>

One day, in December 1268 A.W, you received a letter at base. The sender was Ken Miller. He was a scientist as well as an old friend of yours. He had immigrated to Dezolis to conduct his research years ago.  These were the contents of the letter: &amp;quot;How are you?  I have succeeded in the discovery of the century. You must come and see it.&amp;quot;

You travel to the planet Dezolis and visit a town called Carsonville. There, you find out that Dr. Miller has invented a machine that can make human beings immensely powerful. The problem is, Dr. Miller is kidnapped, along with his invention. With the help of his sister Laila you have to solve this mystery.

This game is a Japanese-style adventure game set in the Phantasy Star universe. You interact with the game world by choosing available options such as &amp;quot;See&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Talk&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Move&amp;quot;, etc. There are a few puzzles to solve, but the largest part of the game is dedicated to exploration and dialogue with the characters.</resource>

    <resource id="792bcd2c0825b03fae61e09cf92fc2e6df54da99" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Long ago, the evil Cablon ravaged the Copto planet, a light year away of the Algol system. When he was defeated, he was sealed on a planet discovered by Alis, the heroine of the first &amp;quot;Phantasy Star&amp;quot;, a planet that was also known as Alisland. In this gaiden (side-story) set in Phantasy Star universe, you play the role of two young people from the village Tedo - Alec and Mina. One day, Mina finds an old artifact. While wondering what that could be, the young people learn that Alec' father was attacked and kidnapped by bandits. Determined to find him, the two heroes embark on a dangerous journey that will eventually lead them much further than they suspect. 

Phantasy Star Gaiden plays pretty much like any other Phantasy Star starting with the second game: both towns and dungeons are in top-down view, the turn-based battles are viewed from first-person perspective. The gameplay is standard console-style RPG: you should fight random enemies, gain experience and gold, buy better equipment, visit many towns and dungeons, etc.</resource>

For example, you can shoot reflective blocks that bounce your shots around the room. You can look around the stages and think of the best way to finish the level based on the enemies and stage layouts. Enemies function differently, adding to the puzzle.</resource>

Mike has to fight drug dealers and must rescue a certain number of hostages at each level. The Predator's three-dotted laser aim is a menace to avoid, which can kill either the hostages or Mike himself. Gang members killed drop drugs which can be picked up for points (and sent to the drugs squad). At the end of each level a boss must be defeated.

Mike can move and shoot in all 8 directions, but can only stop and shoot up, down, left and right. Besides his pistol, Mike can also collect new weapons such as grenades, shotguns, machine-guns and rifles. Body armor can be collected for health and med kits for extra lives.</resource>

You're not going to let that happen are you? Try to escape from the dungeon, take out Jaffar's guards, find your way through the Sultan's palace and defeat Jaffar himself. Now go, you've got 60 minutes!

Prince of Persia is a 2D platformer with run and jump gameplay. Your hero must avoid deadly traps, solve some simple puzzles and engage in sword fights with the guards. The player has an infinite amount of lives, but has to restart at the beginning of a level each time he dies, and must complete the game within an hour. An especially noteworthy aspect of the game is the very fluent animation of your character.

The Game Boy Color and SNES versions of the game feature additional levels and new enemies. The Genesis version has a new intro and an altered set of graphics but the level layout remains almost identical to that of the original.</resource>

The game later brought to Sega Mega Drive and Sega Game Gear, with the latter being renamed Puzzle &amp; Action: Ichidant-R GG. So far the game has never been released outside of Japan (and South Korea).

Like Tant-R, Ichidant-R is a series of timed minigames, represented in the graphical style seen in Bonanza Bros.. Ichidant-R was bundled with Quiz Rouka ni Tattenasai! in Sega Ages Rouka ni Ichidant-R for the Sega Saturn, and it was also bundled with Tant-R as part of volume 6 in the Sega Ages 2500 series for the PlayStation 2. It was also released for the Wii's Virtual Console service in 2007.

One final game in the Puzzle &amp; Action series, Puzzle &amp; Action: Treasure Hunt was released for Sega Titan Video arcade hardware in 1997.</resource>

It is the first in Puzzle &amp; Action series, and has subsequently been ported to the Sega Mega Drive and Sega Game Gear. Though the arcade version of Tant-R reached South Korea, the Mega Drive version remained exclusive to Japan and no versions of the game have ever made it to North America or Europe.

Tant-R borrows its graphical style from Bonanza Bros., and is therefore often seen as a spin-off. The two were paired with the game's sequel, Puzzle &amp; Action: Ichidant-R in volume 6 of the Sega Ages 2500 series for the PlayStation 2. Tant-R was also paired with Quiz Syukudai wo Wasuremashita for a compilation on the Sega Saturn. A spinoff Saturn game, Sega Ages Vol.1 Syukudai ga Tant-R, also made.</resource>

Now they must find the Shaven Yak and return him his hooves, or there won't be any more Yak shaving days!

In this platform game the player is prompted to choose playing either as Ren or Stimpy at the start of new life or some stages. Both can jump and shoot (Ren shoots toothbrushes, Stimpy spits), but each one has his own special ability: Ren can perform high jumps, Stimpy can smash things jumping over them. Each character starts the game with three lives.

Throughout levels such as &amp;quot;The Blacker Than Black Forest&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;The Stinking Dry Desert&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;The Stinking Wet Bayou&amp;quot;, Ren and Stimpy will face most animal enemies, such as birds, frogs, vultures, woodpeckers, snakes, etc. The levels are divided in few or several sub-level, and at the end of each level, they'll face a boss.

They'll also find some unusual weapons, as a slice of bread (which flies in circles), a remote controller (which casts electric waves) and a soap bar (which casts bubbles). If they get hit when using a weapon, they'll lose it, but won't lose health. They'll gain health by picking items like TVs, cash bags, bottles and boots.

The HUD contains damage and energy meters along with a miniature ring up the top of the screen, useful to see the player's position in the ring so as not to get backed into a corner real easily.

Players can compete in the standard, 1-Player v. CPU, 1-Player v. 2-Player or even a career mode, where there are four preset fighters to choose from along with an option to create customers boxers. The career starts out at position #25 in the ranking and players slowly work up the ladder, going to the gym in between bouts to build up stats to eventually take on &amp;quot;Big Daddy&amp;quot; himself, Riddick Bowe.

The game is practically a copy of Evander Holyfield's Real Deal Boxing, save for the graphics style and the included fighters.</resource>

You play as the cyborg Eco35-2, half-man half-robot, created by the Electrocorp company, in order to counter the mutiny that is brewing in their Metropolis 4 factory, following the reprogramming of certain robots by injecting them with the EGO virus, making them aware of their situation and therefore aggressive. You will have to fight them one by one in duel battles to stop this rebellion.
The title was intended to be graphically revolutionary. But although the fighting robots are quite nice (with 3D sprites transcribed in a 2D universe), the scenery is only in dull static 2D. Also, the in-game animation is slow, even quite &amp;quot;heavy&amp;quot;, directly impacting the handling. 
The slowness of your robot and the varying power of the enemies (to the point that some robots are ultra powerful and atomize you in two shots) quickly make the fights unbalanced.</resource>

Starting at the back of the pack the objective is always to finish first on a linear course, overtaking the other bikers. This is achieved by driving very well or by playing it dirty, knocking opponents of their bikes using clubs, crowbars or your bare hands. The other racers fight back in a similar fashion and there are also hazards. All the races take place on the regular road with normal traffic and the cops, as well as occasional oil slicks and stray cows.

By winning races you can get promoted to a stronger division and earn cash with which you can buy a better bike. Whenever you're knocked off your bike or hit something you will have to run back to your bike and lose valuable time, plus your bike will suffer some damage.</resource>

The teams are updated, with the sides present in the 92-93 European tournaments included, and the player names updated to take transfers into account. 

The game was tidied up and changed in a number of areas. The most significant change is the addition of red and yellow cards for discipline (2 yellow card offenses or one ‘professional foul’ (denying your opponent a clear goal-scoring opportunity) results in that player being sent off). The goalkeepers have been improved in skill, and the 1994 World Cup Qualifying tournament was added.

Like most Mahjong Solitaire variants, it takes its name from a region in China: in this case, the former Imperial Palace of China, also known as The Forbidden City.

The goal of the game is to get the protagonist, who is a jiang shi by default, to the exit. To do this they must push mahjong tiles out of the way. Most mahjong tiles will disappear once they touch one or more of the same type, and these tiles will also vanish along with it. Some, like the dragon or wind tiles, are barricades that will transform any tile that comes into contact into another barricade.</resource>

After a prolonged war, the kingdoms of Cypress and Gardiana decided to join forces fighting the evil empire of Iom. Nick, the Prince of Cypress, that was conquered by Iom, had his hand turned into stone during the last battle, and therefore cannot wield his legendary Sword of Hajya. Nevertheless, he tries to recruit people who would help him to gain his kingdom back.

The game is a strategy RPG. You command a large party composed of several units, and most of the game is spent in battles. The turn-based battles occupy the entire location; during your turn, you command your troops to move around and to attack. Your main heroes gain levels in a RPG fashion.

    <resource id="7c9ac32bcec8a4fc54710bb0ff7c8f18f4d581b6" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">The first of the three Shining Force games for GameGear, this is a Japanese-only gaiden (side-story) to the main series. The events take place in a time period between the first and the second Shining Force games (twenty years after the events of the first game), in a kingdom called Cypress. The ambassador of Cypress kidnaps Anri, the princess of Gardiana, casting a spell on her that envelops her in dark fog. You control Nick, a young prince who decides to help the princess, aided by the warrior team of the first Shining Force.

The game is a strategy RPG with a typical Shining Force-style combat: the largest part of the game is spent fighting enemy forces. You move your party (up to twelve characters) around, attacking or casting spells. Once in contact with the enemy, a short automatic battle sequence occurs. You gain experience points for every attack. Unlike other Shining Force games, you cannot visit towns in this game.

The events of the game take place in a time period between the first and the second mainstream Shining Force games. After Max, the leader of the first Shining Force, defeated the Dark Dragon, peace was restored to the world. However, the sorceress Mishaela took control over the forces of evil. Pursuing her, Max' comrades got injured and were forced to quit. Upon returning back to their hometown, they found out Mishaela has already taken the Elder hostage. Lead by the young warrior Ian, the Force has to find Max and to defeat Mishaela.

The game is a strategy RPG with gameplay similar to other Shining Force games. You control a large party of warriors (you can choose the characters yourself from many available). The game consists mainly of large strategic turn-based battles, in which you navigate your characters around and attack the enemies physically, or cast area-based spells.</resource>

New to this release is the MegaMan-like ability to select which stage (all also unique for this release) to play in any sequence.  Each stage contains a fellow elemental ninja held prisoner, who gets released once you complete the level.  You can then switch between available ninja mid-stage to take advantage of their unique abilities (green ninja double jumps, blue ninja has a grappling hook, yellow ninja walks on water, etc.) which become a necessity to successfully complete all the levels.</resource>

After each stage completed (and some luck), a bonus stage will appear, as well as the chance to earn extra balls. You will only need a good target in the parquet block!</resource>

On each of the five levels, Bart must collect (or get rid of) the ingredients that the Space Mutants are planning to use to build their machine, such as purple objects or balloons. He also has to collect enough &amp;quot;proof&amp;quot; of the aliens existence (brown coins left behind when they are jumped on), so his family members will help him when he meets a boss (characters such as Nelson and Sideshow Bob). This won't be easy since the Space Mutants are &amp;quot;using&amp;quot; human bodies as disguise. In order to discover who are the real Space Mutants, Bart must use his X-ray Specs.

The ways Bart can get rid of those objects sought by the Space Mutants are numerous. For instance, in the first stage, Bart must get rid of purple objects. He can dye them red, cover them, wash them, etc. Some even involve a little puzzle solving, like playing a trick on Moe to make him get out of the bar.

Bart also has some coins that can be used in many ways throughout the game, like buying things, getting devices operating, etc. Those coins are essential to solve some puzzles in the game.

I'll put all my awesome super-powers to the best when I battle the slimy Swamp Hag, the evil Dr. Crab and the bad-tempered Lava Man. Once I wipe these villains out and restore Radioactive Man's powers, we'll take on the brains behind this ugly scheme, Brain-O The Magnificent.

So quit reading and buy this game OR ELSE. That's an order from Bartman, man!!!

-THIS LOOKS LIKE A JOB...FOR BARTMAN!
-WILL A BLAST OF COLD BREATH PUT THE FREEZE ON SWAMP HAG?
-THE TERRORS OF THE DEEP ARE NO  MATCH FOR THE MIGHTY BARTMAN!
-DANGER LURKS EVERYWHERE IN THE JUNKYARD!
-IT'S FIST AGAINST CLAW IN THE EVIL DR. CRAB'S LAIR!</resource>

One of the new things in the sequel is a lag boost system, which means that anyone who is behind gets a boost to catch up again. This keeps the action in the game. Another new thing is that the gadgets touched while racing do not come into effect immediately. They need to be triggered manually by pressing up on the D-pad.

There are 3 GPs to compete in and each GP has 6 tracks. The names of the GPs are:

1. Purple Chaos GP
2. White Chaos GP
3. Blue Chaos GP

Racing skills can be improved in the Free Run mode on any of the tracks, or, with a Gear-to-Gear cable and a spare copy of the game, direct competition against another human player in the versus mode.</resource>

Like the later Sonic 3D Blast, this game uses a 3/4 isometric view. Make your way across four main zones, each divided into four stages. In order to complete a stage, you must find the three keys and open the exit before time runs out.

But watch out! Enemies want to hinder your progress. Knock them out with your Spin Dash. And be on the look out for obstacles like bumpers, flippers, teleporters, spikes, and conveyor belts. Collect power-ups to increase your chances of success.</resource>

    <resource id="8ae256fb5e132a2378f21b1afa7b00f9ac3dab61" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">SEGA's mascot Sonic the Hedgehog made his debut in a famous Genesis title, but Sega's 8-bit systems got their own version of the platformer, featuring the same story and gameplay style, but different levels. To stop the evil Dr. Robotnik, Sonic must traverse six zones consisting of three levels each. Most of the zones are based on those in the original game, but some are entirely new. Enemies and power-ups are mostly the same as well. Sonic can pick up golden rings for protection (when hit, he simply loses all of his rings instead of a life) and bonuses: 100 rings gain Sonic an extra life, and 50 remaining rings at the end of a level allow access to pinball-themed special stages full of bumpers and springs. The final level of a zone is always a boss fight against Robotnik. Sonic should also collect the six Chaos Emeralds to keep them from falling into Robotnik's hands. In a departure from the original game, these are not hidden in the special stages but somewhere in the regular levels.</resource>

While Sonic &amp; Tails are out searching for them, Robotnik finds the yellow emerald and convinces Knuckles the Echidna that Sonic wants to steal all the other Emeralds. While all this is happening, Nack the Weasel seizes his chance to take the emeralds for himself while everyone else is pre-occupied. Now it's a 4-way race to retrieve the emeralds.

The gameplay is like the other Sonic titles, but this is only available on the Game Gear. The player can choose to play as Sonic or Tails (who can fly), and you're trying to reach the Chaos Emeralds before anyone else. A change from other Sonic games is that when hit, all rings are not lost, only a set amount (30–50 depending on the level) is lost.

Sonic finds a letter waiting for him, that reads:

&amp;quot;Dear Sonic,

Robotnik is back, and he's captured all the animals on the island! He is holding me in a place called the Crystal Egg. In order to free me, you have to find and bring the six Chaos Emeralds.

Robotnik made me write this. He says he's waiting for you, and he's created six really nasty robots in order to 'get rid of you once and for all.' I don't know what he has planned, but Sonic, please be careful!

Sincerely, Tails.&amp;quot;

That being more that enough motivation for him, Sonic races out to defeat Robotnik again.

The master system version is totally different than the Sonic 2 for Genesis. Tails obviously doesn't accompany you, like he can in the Genesis release. Sonic can also not do his infamous buzzsaw roll by simply ducking and pressing jump.</resource>

Finding the right way to move all the crates on the right spots becomes increasingly difficult and you have to plan numerous steps in advance in order not to block your own way. The game features over 25 levels with 10 sub-levels each one. You can always choose the order in which you want to complete the sub-levels, but you have to complete all sub-levels in order to advance to the next main-level. If you have finished the game or become hopelessly stuck, there is also an option to create your own levels.

&amp;quot;Doctor Octopus is plotting the crowning caper of his criminal career... to rule the world.
He has reunited the Sinister Six and with these super-villains together again, nothing stands in their way - except Spider-Man!&amp;quot;

Spider-Man: Return of the Sinister Six is a side-scrolling game which puts you in the role of Spidey throughout six levels against Electro, Sandman, Mysterio, Vulture, Hobgoblin and Doctor Octopus respectively. Some puzzle solving (like finding a key) is necessary to beat some levels. Spidey can duck jump, climb walls, punch, shoot webs to swing (by pressing punch and jump together) and perform a jump kick (by pressing the punch button twice). Collecting web cartridges allows Spidey to shoot limited web projectiles.

Although hard to die, Spidey has only one life, there are no items to recharge life (but killing some guys will do so) and only one continue.

The game has several different playing modes. The first is starship combat: seen from the main screen of the Enterprise (both the -B or the -D version) you navigate the ship through space, firing phasers or photon torpedoes at enemies like Tholians, Klingons and Romulans. Another mode has you navigating the ship to its destination by flying through rectangles in space.

On away missions, the view switches to a top-down perspective where you control a single character and can fire your phaser at enemies.

Finally, the game has two puzzle modes. In the first one, frequencies must be decoded: this is done by putting symbols into the right order. One can only guess the order at first, but after an attempt the game reveals how many of the selected symbols are part of the combination and how many are in the right place. Using logic, the right order can be determined, but there are only a limited number of tries.

The second puzzle mode is used to reroute power from one system to another. To do so, a path must be built on a grid for the energy to flow through. The path must be built out of randomly assigned pieces that don't always fit together, similar to the concept of Pipe Mania.

The game begins on Tatooine, where you, as Luke Skywalker, must travel around and meet up with R2D2, C3PO, Obi-Wan, and so on. Eventually, you travel through Mos Eisley and the Death Star as well.  While most of the game has you controlling Luke, Han or Leia directly, some of the various game styles include a first-person Millennium Falcon asteroid belt sequence, and an overhead view Death Star trench run.</resource>

    <resource id="e87ab0b1c837c97add86a01a243dfd36faa010c2" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">The handheld version of Stargate is a matching puzzle game, similar to a 3-D  Tetris. Players drop tiles into a Stargate, and try to stack three identical symbols. Doing so clears those tiles. Mismatched tiles simply build stacks higher and higher, and the player loses if the tiles reach the top of the gate. The player is also given a seven-symbol Stargate &amp;quot;address&amp;quot; along the top of the screen. Stacking three copies of a symbol listed in the address will clear the stack and counts toward completing the address.

There are two game modes building on this basic concept:

1. Skill Mode is a single-player challenge where the player tries to complete as many addresses as they can before being overwhelmed. Speed increases with completed addresses.

Battle Mode can be played against the computer, or against a second player connected with a link cable. In Battle Mode, any stacks you clear are sent through the Stargate and appear on your opponent's side. A height level meter is added on the sides to show how close you and your opponent are to overflowing their gates. You can win by outlasting your opponent (while sending complete stacks through to make things more difficult for them) or by being the first to complete the address.</resource>

Gameplay is straightforward and simple. Three buttons are used, one to jump, other to attack and another to perform a range attack from a support police car. Each character has a limited set of moves that include punching and kicking or performing a back attack (if in the open), two grapple moves (depending if holding the opponent in front or by the back), a flying attack, and if playing with another player two additional tag attacks, and different abilities: Adam is slow, but a good jumper and a hard hitter, Axel fast and also a hard hitter, but a lousy jumper and Blaze fast and a good jumper, but weak hitter.</resource>

One year later, after their reunion, Adam's brother Sammy returned from school to find their apartment in a mess, and Adam nowhere to be seen, and after calling his two friends, one of them notices a photo of Adam chained to a wall, next to someone they knew very well - Mr. X, who returned to turn the peaceful city once again into a war zone. Now, Axel, Blaze, Sammy, and Axel's good friend Max, a pro wrestler, must head out to stop Mr. X once again...hopefully for good...

Streets of Rage 2 differs from the previous title in several ways. There are changes in both graphics (characters now are bigger, more detailed and with more animation frames, and scenarios are less grainy) and gameplay (the rocket move was replaced by a special move that doubles in offense and defense along several new moves), along other new features such as life bars (and names) for all enemies and the radically different new characters.</resource>

Due to a lack of FIFA (or other footballing body) licensing, local teams and players have falsified-but-recognisable names (for example, Newcastle becomes &amp;quot;Oldcastle&amp;quot;).

    <resource id="c909692ce6d87e903376dd2f769a78aca01837bd" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">In February 1991, The United States of America sent troops into Kuwait and fought in armed combat against the forces of Iraq. Operation Desert Storm featured many different types of units including mobile armor. The M1 Abrams tank division is deployed in a variety of missions to destroy marked Iraqi targets.

Super Battletank: War in the Gulf is a 1st person tank simulation. Players sit in the cockpit to of a M1 Abrams tank. Controls allow the player to accelerate forward, decelerate, rotate the tank's trajectory left and right, move the tank's cannon left and right, fire the weapon and check the map. The goal of the player is to travel to the location of enemy targets, line them up with the Abrams cannon and fire upon them until destroyed. Each mission covers a large area of land and the player will need to consult the real-time map to travel appropriately to target locations. The M1 Abrams tank also features 2 special weapons: The laser which is more powerful than regular cannon, and the smoke screen which allows the player to escape.</resource>

Along with a Versus mode there is also a Story mode as well.

An evil sorcerer by the name of Surhand has stolen a mystical amulet which brings peace and serenity to the land of Phoenicia and hopes to use it to bring death and destruction to the land.  The player must battle their way through his four guards in a series of best two-out-of-three games of Columns in order to face off against Surhand and bring peace back to the land.

The Flash Mode also returns to this version as well as the new Endless Mode where the main objective is to score as many points as possible before the timer runs out.  There are also special columns throughout these modes such as Glitter Columns which eliminates all blocks of the same color on the screen at once as well as Stone Block Columns which can only be eliminated through magic power-ups that can be obtained by eliminating the base blocks.</resource>

All changes, from team edits to options, are stored in the cartridge internal memory.

About the game itself, it was one of the most popular of the time, featuring a top-down view  with the ball not sticking to the players' feet being the most prominent gameplay feature.</resource>

As well as the famous Monaco course, others from around the world have been added, to give the game a longer shelf life. You must complete qualification sessions and the races as fast as possible.

The Genesis version of Super Monaco adds a complete career mode, however.  In the career mode, your goal is to win a season of races. Unfortunately, you start with a relatively slow car.  By challenging other drivers, you can move to a better team and car, and ultimately win the F1 World Title.</resource>

The world's most popular television show is Smash T.V., an ultra-violent contest between two armed-to-the-teeth combatants, set loose in a series of deadly arenas that are filled to bursting with hordes of mindless beasts and killer robots. The aim of the game is to blast everything in sight and try to grab more cash and prizes than the other guy. Toaster ovens, VCRs, fancy cars and luxury holidays are there for the taking... for anyone who can survive long enough to enjoy them.

Smash T.V. is an insane shoot-em-up from the brain of Eugene Jarvis, creator of Robotron: 2084. It retains that game's frantic style of play and two-joystick control method, but adds plenty of gore, violence, a hint of satire and that all-important two player mode.</resource>

Gameplay consists of standard platform action spiced up with some slightly different (gameplay-wise) sequences. Race to Jabba the Hutt's palace in a speeder, fight your way through Jabba the Hutt's minions before killing Jabba himself, control speeder bikes and the Millennium Falcon, and much more.

The entire introduction of how the surfers discover they are the sons of a Patusani king is not mentioned and instead the player is thrown in the story as a ninja trainee right away. Colonel Chi wants to overthrow the kingdom and kill the last heirs, so he sends troops of ninjas to kill the two brothers.

Players control one of the brothers as he travels through different locations such as the Palace restaurant, the docks at Venice (California), the island of Patu San and more. The 2D side-scrolling platforms missions contains platforms, enemies and ninjas and various hazards. One button is used to jump while the other, in combination with the D-pad, launches punches, kicks, throws and various combos. Attacks can also be performed from the air or using very high jumps.

During gameplay an options screen can be accessed to review the statistics (health, strength, reflex and fight), get a hint through Adam's Game Gear, call the ninja Zatch to launch a powerful attack or select a weapon such as shurikens, fireballs, a knife and a sword. By defeating enemies coins are collected to be spent on bonus time on the clock, Zatch power-ups, a bonus life, complete regeneration, a hint, a weapon or a continue.</resource>

This is an action adventure with RPG elements. You wander around the world, visiting towns and descending into dungeons, fighting enemies in real-time combat and getting various items (for healing, HP-increasing, etc.).

    <resource id="f10c5a04031d59d329f573f0182e862fe0364fa0" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">As the title states, this is the home conversion of the arcade rail-shooter based on the film Terminator 2: Judgement Day. Up to two players shoot through future and present levels as robotic killers reprogrammed to serve the human resistance. 

Both players wield a machine gun with infinite ammo that lowers its firing rate (overheats) as it is continuously fired. A secondary weapon (missile launchers in the future, shotguns in the present) has limited ammo but deals heavy damage. Powerups inside the game world include secondary weapon ammo and coolant for the machine guns, and are shot to be collected.

T2: The Arcade Game features seven levels based on specific scenes or general concepts in the film. The first four levels act as a prelude, as the player guns down waves of metal Terminators across a post-apocalyptic Battlefield, a besieged Human Hideout, and through the security checkpoints of the enemy supercomputer SkyNet. After destroying the computer, players travel back in time to protect John and Sarah Connor, while also destroying every scrap of SkyNet research at the headquarters of its manufacturer. From there, players must fend off the indestructible T-1000 until the final showdown in the Steel Mill.

Assets from the movie are used when possible, such as voice clips from Arnold Schwarzenegger, and close-up digital stills of Robert Patrick for the final battle against the T-1000. The Genesis and SNES versions also support lightguns (the Menacer and Super Scope, respectively).

It's an island pulled up by the Chaos Emeralds. Suddenly, while relaxing, Tails hears an explosion that seems like it's coming from inside the island. A Flicky tells Tails that Battle Kukku has invaded the island. He also tells Tails that Battle Kukku is mining here for the Chaos Emeralds, to obtain it's power. Tails gears up and heads for his quest to find the machine parts to build his weapon to defeat the evil Battle Kukku. There are however major plot differences between the Japanese and the western release. In the US and European version of the game it tells the story how Sonic and Tails decide to go separate ways for a while. Tails finds an unknown island and decides to dub it Tails Island. While resting there, a large explosion occurs and a Flicky tells him birds are invading the island.

Unlike the other games in the series, this spin-off is less of a traditional platformer, but has a much slower pace with rpg elements and a focus on puzzle-solving. Tails can walk, jump, fly (momentarily), hang on ledges and throw bombs. He starts with ten health points that can be replenished with rings, but the amount can be extended to 99 by collecting chaos emeralds. In the twelve stages Tails can collect up to 26 items. Per level however, he is only allowed to bring along four and this adds a tactical dimension. One of the most vital tools is the Remote Robot that can squeeze through small areas that Tails cannot reach. Underwater he changes into the small submarine Sea Fox.</resource>

While flying around, Tails discovers an island. It seems to be completely abandoned except for some mine cart tracks. As he lands on the island a cart approaches, and Tails hides in the bushes. The passing silver cart is driven by a woman who says she is Wendy Witchcart. She proclaims that everything on the island is hers and threatens to transform everyone in crystal who does not follow her rules. Tails, determined to save all the animals on the island, sets in a chase to the Witchcart.

Gameplay is fairly similar to the Sonic series. Tails need to defeat enemies and complete obstacles. He can fly, but is constantly suspended. He carries a golden rind that is used to take out enemies or to latch on to devices. Sonic, the emeralds and Dr. Robotnik are not presented, and neither are there rings to collect during the levels.

The game came to other territories as an unlockable minigame in the GameCube version of Sonic Adventure DX and as one of the titles in the Sonic Gems Collection.</resource>

On one of thirty different maps, units are produced and moved out into combat, and the war is only over when the enemy capital has been conquered.

Three basic phases make up each turn: production, movement and combat. Each city or airbase within a distance of five hexagons from your capital may produce one unit each turn, as long as your funds allow it. Each turn yields new funds, whose amount is proportional to the number of cities and airports you have occupied.

Units are moved on the map, which is based on &amp;quot;fake hexagons&amp;quot;; the hexagons are in fact square, but offset on each row so that each square borders six other squares. Each terrain type has different movement and defence values, which makes movement and combat more complicated.

The outcome of combat is determined by the attack strength which varies between different unit types, and by their experience. Each time a unit survives combat, it gains experience points and eventually gains in experience level, which makes the chance of winning in combat higher. As each unit is in fact a squadron of ten, a typical combat will only destroy a certain number of the members of the unit.

An additional moment in the gameplay is the recharging phase. Units which have lost members can be built up to full force in a city or airbase, and those which have run out of ammunition can do the same. Ammunition can also be replenished in the battlefield using supply trucks.

A total of thirteen airbourne and land-based units are available. Some units cannot fight other units; tanks can do nothing against bombers, and mechanised infantry can't protect itself well against a howitzer two squares away.

The game can be played both against the computer or against another human player by linking two Game Gears together.

Somewhere on Tazmania is a Lost Valley, and in that valley nests a huge seabird, so huge that one of it's eggs could feed a family for a year! Just think of the omelette one of those could make!

Thus Taz becomes fascinated and leaves in search of one of those eggs before his Dad has even finished the story...

Taz can Jump, perform a Spinning Jump and a Spin Attack. Munch roast chickens to replenish life. Gain extra points by moving quickly through the levels - there are six stages and each stage has two rounds.

There are a few other items and pickups such as:

1. Spring: boings Taz up to high ledges.
2. Blocks: destructible.
3. 1-UP: extra life.
4. Star: invulnerability. Unless you run into a bomb.
5. Bomb: does what it says on the tin.</resource>

However, the game's six levels mirror the story-line of The Terminator movie very closely as you take on the role of Kyle Reese and his quest to save Sarah Connor from termination.

Because the game follows the movie so closely, the first mission which involves blowing up the SkyNet computer and escaping through time is one of the hardest and something that most players remember with love/hate.</resource>

    <resource id="b1ffa02078fc290d296d5a0d3bf77bae693eb7c8" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Ultimate Soccer is a football (European) game composed by 64 (unlicensed) international teams, each with it's own values for running, ball control and strength. There are five game modes (friendly, penalty shootout, tournament, playoff and league), but the lack of password or built-in battery means each one of them must be completed in one sitting.

The gameplay can be tweaked for the players' preference by changing several key aspects of the physics engine, such as wind strength and direction, ball weight (lighter balls travel higher, faster  and farther but are more prone to be deflected by winds than heavy balls, who barely lift of the ground and are slowed down by wet grass), tightness of ball control and players speed and momentum. A five-a-side mode, where the ball is never out of play is also included. Thanks to the many options regarding the physics, the game allows a lot of flexibility in playmaking, from building up the play with small passes from the midfield to belting the ball upwards in hope of a goalmouth deflection.

Graphically, the game is similar to EA's Madden NFL series, with pseudo-3D effects allowing the view to be tilted up to show more detail up front or tilted down to show more of the field. 

The series later continued with Striker on the same console and Striker' 96 on PC, Saturn and PlayStation.</resource>

The gameplay is the standard fighting game, using one of the three different Troopers to kick, punch and use special abilities to defeat a fighter to advance to the next one.  Each Trooper has their own strengths, weaknesses and special moves and each has their own separate stages, depending on which the player chooses.  It also has multi player capabilities that lets two friends battle head-to-head in a Duel Mode.</resource>

    <resource id="d653cf83fb6811433af9380c7c5af8e8b66e8e55" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Virtua Fighter Animation is an one-on-one 2D fighting game based on the Virtua Fighter anime series. It has two game modes: story and versus.

In the story mode, the player follows the anime's plot, with anime style cutscenes before and after each fight. The story is divided in acts, each one of them corresponding to one fight. The player starts controlling Akira Yuki, as as he beats his opponents, each one of them joins his party, so they can be chosen in the next fights. Besides Akira, the other characters which become available are Pai Chan, Jacky Bryant, Wolf Hawkfield, Kage-Maru, Sarah Bryant and Lau Chan. In the final act, the player must fight against Dural.

The versus mode allows players to choose any of the seven available characters to fight against the CPU. In the two player versus game, Kage-Maru is removed from the character selection.

The Game Gear version has 3 different viewing modes: Normal, Large and Real-Time. The Normal viewing mode shows the fighters from a more distant position (smaller sprites) than the Large mode (larger sprites). The Real-Time mode simulates the zooming camera effects from the other Virtua Fighter games, alternating between the Normal and Large modes. It also has an extended intro sequence, with anime style cutscenes.

In regards to gameplay, the game doesn't differ much from any other 2D fighting game, as the player can perform punches (button 1), kicks (button 2) and jumps (up), as well as some special maneuvers. The Game Gear version has also a block function (START button), absent in the Master System version. The fights are regular best of 3 round matches, and players will loose a round if one of this three possibilities happen: their energy is depleted, they fall out of the ring or they have less energy than the opponent if the time runs out.</resource>

Both Sega Mega Drive and Sega Game Gear versions of WildSnake were advertised for release, but both were cancelled for unknown reasons. Pototypes of both have since surfaced.

Advertising saw Tetris creator Alexey Pajitnov lend his name to the game, however Pajitnov was not involved in its development.</resource>

The ball comes off the grass surface fast and low, reflecting the surface's reputation for providing the most exciting tennis. It's viewed in the typical third person perspective, although with quite a distinct 3D effect and with shadows. You can play standard 1 or 2 player matches, or play the full tournament from the quarter-final stages onwards. You can play standard shots as well as lobs and drop shots, and full service rules are featured. You can select your character and build up their skills as the game progresses.

As Saul, it is your job to traverse five different areas on your way to Draxx. When Saul collects enough power-ups, he turns into his wolf form and gains a special psychic shot attack, which can be improved by collecting futher power-ups. However, if Saul loses health, he turns back into his human form and only has his fists to fight the numerous enemies.</resource>

That's why he has to explore deep dark forests, cross endless oceans, climb treacherous slopes, survive endless volcanoes, and even walk through clouds. But Tom-Tom will never be totally alone. You see, when he goes through the exotic locations, he has to come face to face with its inhabitants, like bees, spiders, snakes, coal-kids, frogs, bats, snails, coyotes, and octopuses, to name a few. The hatchet is Tom-Tom's only line of defense against these menaces.

There are ten areas, each containing four rounds each, but the tenth area can't be accessed unless Tom-Tom collects all the dolls during his rescue mission. During his journey, he can break open different eggs that will reveal hatchets, skateboards, mushrooms, milk, and even guardian angels. You can ride the skateboard through each round, as long as you don't collide with an inhabitant. When you complete each round while still riding the skateboard, you'll start the next round still riding it. As you progress through each round, your vitality will start to get low, but it can be increased by getting milk, mushrooms, potato chips,or fruit that appear everywhere you go. As well as the normal eggs, there are also speckled eggs that must be avoided, otherwise the God of Death will be released, and once he follows you, you'll lose vitality much quickly. At the end of every fourth round, there is a king waiting to destroy you with his fireballs or lightning bolts.

There are also warp-gates, but you don't find them, they find you. You see, warp-gates appear in rounds 1-4 of each area. If you happen to get one fruit, a special item will appear. These special items include handbags, wrist watches, a pair of shoes, a teddy bear, and a bottle of perfume. Another girl will appear and take you up to the clouds where the object is to collect as many hearts as you can without falling down or getting the item again. Once you have collected all the hearts, you can get the item to return to the surface, and more often than not, you'll get further in the round.</resource>

When Tom-Tom defeats the MEKA dragon, the wounded beast casts a spell on him, turning him into a Lizard-Man. To regain your original human form, you have to find the Salamander Cross, hidden by the Vampire Dragon in Monster Land.

In this side-scrolling platform game, you can still buy equipment and items, but unlike its predecessor, it is not divided in sequences of levels. You are allowed to go anywhere, as long as you have the right shape or equipment. During his quest, Tom-Tom has to defeat various dragon bosses. Each win will give you a new shape with new abilities such as flying, swimming, walking on ceilings or clinging to walls, which also give you to access new parts of the world. The possible shapes are Lizard-Man, Mouse-Man, Piranha-Man, Lion-Man and Hawk-Man and the main abilities are defined by attacking power, defense points and charm points (needed for equipment by collecting charm stones). Also, certain blocks can only be destroyed by specific weapons or are only accessible to certain shapes.

The basic actions consist of attacking and jumping, and in the status screen you can equip swords, shields and armour. Special attacks include fire balls, tornadoes, arrows, boomerangs and thunder strikes. Along the way, you collect keys (only one at all times) and gold left behind by defeated creatures, and you often have to revisit places to access new areas. A password is given at the beginning of each town to continue from there.

Sega's answer was called Woody Pop.

With a wooden paddle, which in fact is Woody the tree spirit, you bounce your ball against bricks laid out in a big house filled with toys. The toys will come out to disturb you. When you hit &amp;quot;mystery bricks&amp;quot;, wind-up toy soldiers or robots come out, obstructing your ball. On some levels, a toy train will cross your path as well. Speaking of wells, the bottom of the screen is not a big black hole as in most other games of this kind – instead the whole covers only a part of the wall, so that even if you miss the ball, it might bounce back in the corners.

Once a room is cleared, you can choose freely between up to three adjacent rooms to progress to, making this game less linear than usual.

Like any post-Arkanoid game, there is a range of powerups released from special blocks. Most are known from other games such as the double-ball, the growing bat or the &amp;quot;diamond ball&amp;quot;, which destroys all blocks in its path without ricocheting. Some invented by Sega are the fire ball, which sets blocks on fire, allowing them to destroy even neighbouring blocks, and the big ball, which hits bricks with more power, thereby destroying brick with one hit that would otherwise have required several.</resource>

Several X-Men characters are playable throughout the game. The player can choose from two characters from the start, Cyclops and Wolverine, and three Levels are accessible. In the course of the game, the player can unlock five other X-Men, namely Storm, Iceman, Rogue, Nightcrawler and Psylocke.

The story is that most of the X-Men have been kidnapped by Magneto, which is the reason why only Cyclops and Wolverine are available from the start. Apparently, unlocking the characters equals rescuing him. On the way, there several foes from the X-Men universe to beat, and at the end, Magneto once again needs a reprehension.

The basic mechanics of the game are punching, (double-)jumping and jump-kicking. Furthermore, pressing Start activates/ deactivates the characters mutant ability, for example Wolverine's claws or Cyclops' laser beams. Using it however drains a limited amount of energy, which can be refreshed by finding &amp;quot;X&amp;quot;-symbols.</resource>

He has imprisoned some X-Men from the past to recreate their greatest battles. Wolverine and Rogue have to enter the game and rescue their friends, then defeating Mojo to return back home. 

In this platform game, the player starts choosing either Wolverine or Rogue. At each new level beaten, a new X-Men will be available: first Gambit, then Cyclops, Havoc and finally Shard. If one of the X-Men dies, the player has to start the level again, choosing among the remaining X-Men the one to play. After all the X-Men have died, the game is over.

Each character can activate his/her power at will. Wolverine can use his claws, Rogue can fly, Gambit can throw explosive cards, Cyclops will fire optic blasts, Havoc fires plasma blasts and Shard fires energy blasts. The characters have an energy meter and a power meter, which will worn out as they are hit or use their powers, respectively. They can find items to restore their energy and power.

Gameplay consists basically in finding the way out of each of the six levels. Once finding it, the character will face a boss, usually known characters from the comics like Magneto, Fitzroy, a Sentinel, etc. The last boss is Mojo himself.

If the shape is the same color as your piece, the shape is eliminated, as well as all of the shapes of the same color behind it, until your piece hits a piece of a different color. If the shape is of a different color, or it is hit when collecting a line of similar shapes, your piece exchanges colors with the shape.</resource>
