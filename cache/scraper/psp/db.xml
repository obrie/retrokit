The game was also ported by Spike to the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable.[1] A version for iOS and Android was released as well in 2011.[4]

428: FÅ«sa Sareta Shibuya de is a visual novel set in the Shibuya ward of Tokyo where the narrative is presented using a combination of scrolling text, live action stills and video sequences. The game shares many story and gameplay elements with Chunsoft's 1998 sound novel game Machi, the most prominent being the locale, Shibuya. Although Chunsoft does not openly state 428 is a sequel, the game contains numerous references to Machi, and an early marketing slogan reads &amp;quot;Breaking a long silence, Shibuya gets going again.&amp;quot;

The game has received high praise from critics, earning a perfect score in Famitsu Weekly, Japan's largest circulating video game magazine. The game also features a special scenario contributed by Kinoko Nasu and Takashi Takeuchi of Type-Moon fame, who wrote and provided character designs for them respectively. It was subsequently announced by Sega that this particular scenario by Type-Moon would be adapted into an anime TV series titled Canaan, which began airing in Japan on July 4, 2009.[5] A series of four novels based on the game were published by Kodansha between the months of September and December 2009.[6]</resource>

You could also make a case itâ€™s more than 5 games, because some of the one player vs two player variations could be enough to be considered a whole different game. Regardless of the name, itâ€™s an intriguing package.</resource>

Besides the expected ATV (all-terrain vehicles) there are also a variety of other vehicles to race with, e.g. trucks or bikes, which is the foundation of the career mode: participating in a string of championships which are divided in vehicle type and difficulty. Upgrades and additional vehicles are purchased with credits which can be earned in a number of ways: besides price money for winning races, credits are also awarded for performing stunts. There are also three sponsors which offer free upgrades and/or credits for fulfilling their demands regarding performance and stunt rating, but they should be hired with caution because a big penalty is assigned for missed goals. The available types of races are Supercross, Rallycross, National, Freestyle, Circuit, Endurcross, Rally and Snowcross.

Besides a basic course editor and multiplayer for up to four players (which is also the maximum number of racers in single-player) there are also connectivity features with ATV Offroad Fury 4 which allow to exchange courses/vehicles and access a shared online community.</resource>

Think about it ? when you're a kid, you run around holding your arms out pretending to be a fighter plane, right? Or was that just us? Either way, having an airborne action game of this pedigree on the PSP is never unwelcome, and Joint Assault marks the first time the series has hit the handheld since Ace Combat X in 2006.

So what's changed? Well, certainly not the midair firefights and frenzied atmosphere ? although the visuals have been overhauled and the combat system completely redesigned to provide a closer, more visceral flight experience. While some plane games focus on simulation, Ace Combat focuses on accessibility and fun, without losing authenticity.

You get to jet over plenty of real-world locations including Tokyo, London, San Francisco and more, as you take on missions to smash enemy fighter pilots out of the sky. Tactical dogfighting is the name of the game here, and the 'Enhanced Combat View' takes advantage of the huge aerial environments to provide an exhilarating atmosphere as you deliver that ace shot at high speed.

When you're done with the single-player missions, get online for some multiplayer gameplay, which allows for up to eight players in an online versus scenario, or four pals in a co-op campaign.</resource>

    <resource id="72eff7f95507045fcfae04f08325514bde72820d" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Ace Combat is the perfect game to have while on the move. Think about it ? when you're a kid, you run around holding your arms out pretending to be a fighter plane, right? Or was that just us? Either way, having an airborne action game of this pedigree on the PSP is never unwelcome, and Joint Assault marks the first time the series has hit the handheld since Ace Combat X in 2006.

So what's changed? Well, certainly not the midair firefights and frenzied atmosphere ? although the visuals have been overhauled and the combat system completely redesigned to provide a closer, more visceral flight experience. While some plane games focus on simulation, Ace Combat focuses on accessibility and fun, without losing authenticity.

You get to jet over plenty of real-world locations including Tokyo, London, San Francisco and more, as you take on missions to smash enemy fighter pilots out of the sky. Tactical dogfighting is the name of the game here, and the 'Enhanced Combat View' takes advantage of the huge aerial environments to provide an exhilarating atmosphere as you deliver that ace shot at high speed.

When you're done with the single-player missions, get online for some multiplayer gameplay, which allows for up to eight players in an online versus scenario, or four pals in a co-op campaign.</resource>

    <resource id="412e1e67e52feb1cc6dd7e6136f52cbc5ad0dfad" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Formerly known as Rocket Racing, Aero Racer is a single-player top-down arcade-like futuristic speed racer entailing a competition between colored neon rocket ships.

The defining challenge of the game lies in controlling the momentum of the racing craft by using rear jet-boosters to grind and thrust off track boundaries, resulting in increased acceleration. Unlike other contemporary racing games, there are no weapons or damage meters; players must maintain a single minded effort to beat opponents to the finishing line.

Players can enjoy the following four different game modes: 

1. Campaign: success in races, challenges, and trials enables players to progress through increasingly difficult tiers.
2. Grand Prix: a set of interconnected races.
3. Quick Race: instant pick-up and play mode.
4. Party Mode: players take turns to compete in single-player challenges.</resource>

The farmers, however, won't let their cows go without a fight. Players must tackle wrapping farm mazes of confusion, play hide and sneak under the cover of tall grass, and throw veggies, rocks, or whatever they can get their alien claws on at the farmers as they fight to bring these valuable livestock back to their home world.</resource>

    <resource id="b4f3b0308ba5bbc0ea8fc83bb106b53403c418ad" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Alien Syndrome is a top down shooter inspired by Sega's original Alien Syndrome action game. The games story takes place thousands of years in the future; by this point in time mankind has explored many parts of the galaxy and established numerous colonies. One such colony, Seti-Alpha 5 (SAT5), has ceased communications for some reason and it is your job to head to SAT5 and investigate what went wrong. Upon arrival, you encounter the alien syndrome, a force which can mutate man and machine into deadly aliens. These events take place roughly 100 years after those in the original Alien Syndrome game.

When you begin the game you can select one of several characters as well as choose a character specialty (such as demolitions expert, firebug,  seal, tank, and sharpshooter). The specialty you select will determine your initial character stats; as you play through the game you earn levels which provide you points to allocate towards improving your stats. The character stats help determine your characters accuracy in ranged  or close attacks, speed, healing power, resistance to fire/radiation, armor strength, and so on.

Similar to the original game, the action is viewed top down. You'll need to explore the numerous corridors and rooms found on SAT5 and eliminate the numerous alien invaders found there. Mission objectives are often provided to you which need to be completed. Additional weapons, ammo, and other useful items can be found throughout the levels. Your character has a limited amount of energy, and if all energy is lost then you will need to begin again at the last checkpoint crossed.</resource>

When the protagonist searches for him, she learns he has been recruited by Leviath and is one of his knights. The protagonist fears for his safety and decides to stay with the knights. As she does, she learns that she harnesses a mysterious power which helps Leviath's cause and learns about her lost past.</resource>

Mini-games range from mind-bending quizzes to wacky sports games, to the just plain silly, like protecting a roast banana from oncoming apes, or flying through the sky delivering parachutes to plummeting primates.</resource>

A massive cyclone has sucked all of the fish out of the oceans! The player must safely guide them back. Levels start at the top of the area where the fish are contained in a blob of water. They need to reach the ocean safely at the bottom of the screen with guidance of the player.

Using a variety of creative tools like fans, onions, rockets, and cloud factories, the fish can be guided through platforms, past hungry sharks, piranhas and many other dangers. The tools can also be used to control the flow of the water and the direction the fish travel. Plants will stop the flow and by blowing flowers bridges are opened. At the start of the level, the area usually needs to be scanned first using the free camera perspective to discover all the hazards. Certain fish can be sacrificed, but a sufficient number of them needs to reach the ocean.

The regular mode eventually unlocks the Free Play and Survival modes. In Free Play the player can spend the money from regular games to buy tools for the stages. In survival all levels are replayed in succession, but lost fish are not regained in the next level.</resource>

En route, you are required to run over color markers, which will change the color of your blob to the color required to win the level. Some areas of the game will require you to split your mercury into two, roll each blob over two different colored switches, and then combine the two blobs to form a third, different color.

Each level has different elements to it, some of which will help you and some of which will hinder you.  There are conveyor belts, moving platforms, launch pads, and jagged corners that when hit, will cause your blob to split into two, even three.

There are 83 different mazes, each one progressively harder than the last.</resource>

It was a launch title for the PlayStation Portable in Japan. In America, the game was modified and released as Armored Core: Formula Front - Extreme Battle. As the newly hired architect for a team that has just made it into Formula Front's Bottom League, the player has been tasked with assembling and preparing the team's ACs for battle against those fielded by other Bottom League qualified participants. The decision as to how the ACs should be operated in their upcoming matches, manually or AI-controlled, is left for the player to determine. Both methods offer their own unique challenges. In his Japanese release, the game uses an AI control over the mechas but in the American release, manual control is added. For the re-release in Japan under the name of Armored Core: Formula Front International; the manual controls, fixed bugs, and extra content are included.</resource>

Looking to consolidate power, the Corporations (Crest, Mirage, and Kisaragi) have merged into one super-corporation known as &amp;quot;The Alliance&amp;quot;. Fed up with corporate rule and oppression, and seeing a newfound threat in The Alliance, a Raven known as Jack-O (an important but minor character from Armored Core: Nexus) forms an organization of Ravens known as &amp;quot;Vertex&amp;quot; from the ashes of the fallen Raven's Ark. After rallying a sizable force of fellow Ravens to his cause, Jack-O declares that he will launch an all-out war on the Alliance in 24 hours. Leading the opposing force, a Raven named Evangel has rallied just as many Ravens to the Alliance and is preparing to fight Jack-O head on. Making matters all the more complicated, many Ravens have turned into independent warlords, setting out on their own after the collapse of Raven's Ark.

To finish this volatile situation: you. You are approached by both sides seeking your cooperation. Will you side with the Corporations, or assist Vertex in causing their downfall? You have a choice to make, Raven.</resource>

    <resource id="1a6790bb62764ae26db9b8f55e8390dbd4e44ce9" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Armored Core 3 once again puts you in the shoes of a Raven mercenary, with the task of piloting your own battle machine to use in a range of tasks (from destroying other mechs to seek and destroy missions).

After each mission, you are paid in full. The money raised can then go on towards the purchase of items for your mech. Weapon upgrades, better shields, even the opportunity to purchase what's called an Exceed Orbit, smaller robot gun emplacements that hover around your mech, giving you an added boost of fire power in the crunch. Four-player deathmatch modes are also included, where players pit souped-up mechs against each other to see who is the last robot standing.

The PSP release includes additional new parts and support for ad-hoc wireless play.</resource>

The game has taken care to be true to the culture, featuring real b-boys such as Crazy Legs and recent UK Break-dancing Championship winner Mouse. Music is a mixture of classic b-boy themes such as The Mexican by Babe Ruth.

The gameplay is a combination of fighting game mechanics with a music rhythm game. The player pulls off different combinations to accrue points and defeat opponents (human and cpu). In deference to the global popularity of B-Boying, the game takes place at global locations from Japan to Europe to New York. There are 21 venues in total. In the B-Boy Life mode, you have to gather a crew and battle against superstars. You can also create your own character and define the moves.</resource>

The story is set in the Bakumatsu era, at the end of the shoguns' rule over Japan in the middle of the 19th century. The Tokugawa shogunate uses the brainwashing Heaven's Songs by the top idols in Shinsengumi to subjugate the country and its people. In this Japan, writing or singing any songs besides the Heaven's Songs is a capital offense. Ry?ma Sakamoto and the other rockers rise up and change the world with rock 'n' roll for freedom and justice.</resource>

There are two difficulties of play: Beginner, which automatically fields the ball for the player while Exciting has the player do the field manually. Additionally, there are two main modes of play where in the single player mode the player will compete in a fifteen-team tournament or go head-to-head against a friend in a multiplayer mode.

The standard rules of baseball still apply, but it adds power-ups that the player can pick up and use during the game, such as the ability for their pitcher to throw faster or their batter to hit better. They can also substitute a player during the game, but are limited to three substitutions per game. The game is shown through 2D graphics with comic-style cutscenes to illustrate the action, such as dramatic catches and home runs that will pop-up during the game.</resource>

Instead of a traditional season mode as in many other baseball simulations, in The BIGS there is a mode titled Rookie Challenge, where the player creates a ballplayer and tries to lead him and his team to the World Series. Another mode, Home Run Pinball, puts a hitter in the middle of Times Square, New York, with the aim to hit balls into windows and neon lights.</resource>

The game is divided up into several missions in which the player must clear objectives to progress.

On the main overworld, BRS can explore the available areas and look for certain items. Battle begins when the player comes into contact with an enemy on the overworld.

During battle, BRS can aim and shoot with her rock cannon at enemies, block against attacks and sidestep to avoid them completely. If the player fires the rock cannon or uses the sidestep too much in a short time, the system will overheat, leaving the player vulnerable to attack until it cools down.

Throughout the game, players can earn abilities that can be equipped to BRS and used in battle, each with their own cooldown periods. These include offensive attacks such as a powerful blast, a sniper rifle, or support abilities that can increase BRS' stats such as her attack or defense. Certain sections will also see BRS ride a motorcycle, in which she can attack enemies on either side of her or use weapons to fire in front of enemies</resource>

Continuing where Heat the Soul left off, the story mode of Heat the Soul 2 ranges from the Soul Society: The Sneak Entry arc to the end of the Soul Society: The Rescue arc[2] and features 12 playable characters. As opposed to Heat the Soul's story mode, however, this game allows you to follow the story of the selected character rather than a single, designated plot. For example, if you were to choose Ichigo Kurosaki, you would fight all his battles with the shinigami, whereas if you chose to play as Byakuya Kuchiki, you must stop Ichigo and his friends from saving Rukia Kuchiki.</resource>

Unique to Heat the Soul 3 are &amp;quot;Soul Road&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Karakura Heroes.&amp;quot; In Soul Road, the player is to select the desired character and partner character. Afterwards, the player is set on a board game-like map where the goal is to pass through markers in order to fight enemies. After each match, the player is given an amount of &amp;quot;Trust points&amp;quot; (how many received depends on the mode's difficulty) which go towards leveling up partner characters and unlocking bonuses, such as alternate costumes and new partners. To unlock these bonuses, the player must find a blue marker to turn in their points; however, before doing so, the player must answer a multiple choice question. In Karakura Heroes, the player is put into a humorous side-story, with some extra anime scenes added. Don Kanonji leads a group of shinigami, initially Byakuya Kuchiki and Toshiro Hitsugaya, on some sort of wacky adventure which involves battling several other characters. At the mode's completion, a scene shows the gang relaxing at an expensive hotel, doing activities that in some way fit their personalities and/or abilities (for example, Hitsugaya snowboarding).</resource>

Like previous installments it picks off where the other Heat The Soul left off, the story picks up from the entry of Hueco Mundo to the encounter between Grimmjow and Ichigo. New features include a &amp;quot;Tag Action&amp;quot; system and a new way for releasing zanpakuto. Transformations such as Bankai are now made when 2 bars of reiatsu is obtained and then pressing the L button, rather than selecting a character's Bankai form before a fight. There also seems to be 3 styles of tag action: offensive, defensive and technical. There is also a game mode called Tag Master, which lets you choose 2 characters to fight with in a series of fights. The system also includes specials which use the tagged partner's abilities.

The game features 32 characters usable in Tag Battle mode, while extra characters can be obtained with Bleach: Heat The Soul 4 game save through game conversion. However, these characters are only usable in single mode with no in-game transformation. They are selected through a separate menu accessible by pressing L/R in the normal character menu.</resource>

    <resource id="196d61527a55aca5c9dfd69aadb3988ad7661d24" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Bliss island is an action-puzzler where you play a character called Hoshi (a Zwooph), who using blasts of air from his trunk, can juggle or manipulate other objects or himself. The game consists of a collection of mini games, which can either be played individually (with the aim being to get a highscore) or through the adventure mode (where you play each one in order, only progressing to the next one once you've achieved a goal/high enough score).

The mini games consist of tasks such as

1. Smashing invader-style blocks as they march down the screen, by moving Hoshi into them. This is done by blasting pulses of air from Hoshi, which then make him move.

2. Blowing fruit balls into other objects (such as flower bumpers) so that they ricochet around the screen and into a monsters mouth, similar to Pachinko machines in arcades.

3. A trickshot billiards game, where you fire Hoshi into the balls on the table, trying to pot them all within a certain number of air pulses

4. Bee Racing, where using similar controls to Hoshi, you race against AI Bees around a track (whilst avoiding obstacles such as rocks and snails)

5. ... and various other mini games that follow the theme of ricocheting balls off targets / into holes either within a time limit or to achieve a goal (such as to clear bugs off a flower, to hit another ball off the same colour, to pick up stars, etc.)

The PC version is single player only, but the PSP version also has a 2 player wireless mode (local adhoc), which has multiplayer versions of Bee Racing, Invaders and a multiplayer only Soccer game.</resource>

The world's largest Tabletop Wargames company continues to sell the game's miniatures today. Also, its creator never stopped improving and enriching Blood Bowl's game system and universe with several rule changes. Today, Blood Bowl remains very popular around the world thanks to a large community of players and numerous dedicated fansites. As for old Blood Bowl players, they have unforgettable memories of all the passionate games they used to play.

    <resource id="dbd72be626adc909216b6455165850e5e90624f4" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">In Bloons, the player assumes the role of a monkey sitting on a platform in the clouds attempting to pop as many balloons as possible. The player uses the touch screen of the iPhone or iPod Touch in order to aim the primate's throw and indicate its velocity; letting go of the touch screen throws the dart and physics takes its course. Each level has a minimum number of balloons that must be popped before progressing to the next level.

In addition to the standard balloons, various levels have special balloons, such as a balloon with extra darts, a tack-filled balloon which will pop all nearby balloons if it is burst, and balloons containing boomerangs (useful for tricky balloon-popping maneuvers). Different levels also have varying obstacles which must be overcome as part of the puzzle, such as blocks which might be destructible with a dart.</resource>

    <resource id="5b7f2bbc0a64e2e03fa55c37a58a5d70308dcc76" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">This version of Brain Challenge expands on the one created for mobile phones. Players tackle 30 brain exercises in five different categories (Focus, Visual, Logic, Math and newly-added Memory).

Game modes include Test, Free Training, and Kid Mode for younger players. In Creative Mode, players perform relaxing activities like drawing. In Stress Mode, players perform the same tests as the regular Test mode except with the addition of distracting images, flashes, and sounds. More difficult versions of the original tests also appear in this mode.

Charts track each player's overall performance and progress.  Players can also select an A.I. coach to guide them through the various tests and assist them in setting and reaching training  goals. Up to four players can challenge each other offline or online.

The Xbox 360 version includes Avatar support.  Some of the extra modes must be downloaded in an add-on pack for the Playstation 3.</resource>

It has simple controls and an arcade feel. Gameplay largely involves pressing a button at the right time to hit a shot, take a catch, return a throw, and bowl a good delivery.

The 'Pressure Play' in the title refers to a new game mode that was introduced for the PSP version. Pressure Plays are essentially challenges requiring the player to complete a given task within certain defined parameters. Early Pressure Plays involve bowling no extras, or playing block shots. Later Pressure Plays involve famous run chases, holding out for rain, and hitting six sixes off an over.

The game supports ad-hoc PSP multiplayer for 2 players, but does not support game sharing. Additionally, the game focuses exclusively on one-day internationals, with no option to play tests, 20-20s, or county cricket.</resource>

As you race through the treacherous and ever changing roadways, the numerous enemy cars will be trying to bump you off the road. You need to make sure you bump the cars out of the way before you get bumped and crash into the sides yourself! Your car also has the ability to jump quite high if you have enough speed. This is useful to jump over enemy cars if there are too many in the way, and must also be used to jump gaps in the roadway and other highway obstacles. As the levels progress, the road becomes narrower with more obstacles in the way, and the other cars increase in number and in aggressiveness.</resource>

The game is mainly focused on returned Burnouts feature - draining a complete boost meter without stopping wich was last seen in Burnout 2: Point of Impact. With return of Burnouts feature there were four new game modes added including Maniac Mode (players need to drive dangerously to get highest scores by earning drifts, air, oncoming and near misses. Chaining Burnouts in this mode increases the score multiplier), Drift Challenge (in this mode player need to obtain as many feet of drifting as possible. Chaining Burnouts also increases the score multiplier here), Near Miss Challenge (same as Drift Challenge, but player needs to score near miss bonuses), Burnout Challenge (also same as Drift Challenge, but focusing on obtaining Burnouts score).
However, some options have been removed from the game - for instance Burnout Dominator doesn't feature Crash Mode, there is also no Traffic Checking Mode and Online Multiplayer. But PSP version features Burnout HQ where you can upload you score and download new track. 
The game consists of 12 different tracks, in 8 different real world locations. Each track has a forward and a reverse configuration.</resource>

PSP puts gamerâ€™s knowledge to the test at home or on the move. With six new round types specifically designed for PSP including the speed-is-of-the-essence 'Quickfire Challenge', the picture-puzzler 'Picture This' and the mind-boggling 'Virus Challenge', each round also comes complete with pictures and videos .

The focus of Buzz! has always been on social gaming and the PSP version is no different, with three exciting multiplayer modes ideal to play with friends and family. The game features three multiplayer modes that require either one PSP (to pass around) or one copy of the game (thanks to Game Share, users can pass their friends a temporary copy of the game to play to play with up to four players.) Additionally, Quiz Host mode enables up to six players to play against each other, with one taking control of the game to select and ask the questions. The Quiz Host runs the whole game, with the power to award (or even deduct) points however they see fit. Not only does Buzz! PSP offer innovative multiplayer handheld quiz action; it also has more robust single player mode than previous Buzz! games.</resource>

The game is available for PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable consoles. It allows users to use question packs purchased for previous Buzz! games as well as supporting user created content and online play. Unlike the previous PSP Buzz!, Buzz: Quiz World (PSP) supports DLC. As with all previous Buzz games the game is available in a game only (Solus) version or in a bundle which includes 4 wireless Buzz! Buzzers and a USB dongle for wireless connectivity (each dongle can connect 4 buzzers to the PlayStation 3).

Quiz World features a mix of old and new round types. For example, one new round hides the answers and then slowly reveals them.[3]

A new feature in Quiz World is player profiling and the host Buzz addressing the player by name, informing them of their abilities and record as a player.[4]

Buzz!: Quiz World also supports PlayStation Home rewards that are rewarded by winning the prize after a round of Buzz!: Quiz World. It supports full game launching for PlayStation Home as well.

In late-March 2010, Sony and Relentless released a patch for Buzz!: Quiz World that added a feature to allow players to post to Facebook from within the game. According to the companies involved,[5] this made the game the first in the world to offer such functionality. The patched Facebook features allow players to post details of the game session just played, including the in-game names of those who took part, and who won.</resource>

Hunt in 5 different countries like South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe and Mozambique, each with their own challenges and perils.

You have several different firearms, rifles from the .243 (designed mostly for small antelopes) up to the .600 (for big game like Elephants and Rhinos), shotguns for bird hunting and small caliber hand guns designed to protect you against small predators.

Each stage has five hunts, from tracking several small game, one big trophy game, bird hunting, herd hunting, in which you sit in the back of a jeep and try to bring down a trophy animal in the midst of a herd, and finally the Trophy Hunt in which you take down one of the Big 5 of Africa (Rhino, Leopard, Elephant, Cape Buffalo and the Lion).  You also have a tracker which gives you clues on where to find your game, a porter to give you advice of which firearm to use and a guide to help you along and set up the hunts.  Each hunt has a specific time limit so you won't have time to take in the beautiful surroundings in the game.  

The landscape is populated with all kinds of animals, most harmless and will run when they catch wind of you, but you have to watch out for predators who will attack, especially Hyenas, wild dogs and even leopards and cheetahs.  Elephants and rhinos will attack to if they feel provoked.

After completing a safari you can play it again in the Open Safari in the main menu if you want to go back to a favorite hunt, plus after you take down the Trophy Hunt animals you can go after them again on the main menu with the option called The Big Five and even hold tournaments to see who is the better hunter.  A sure-fire winner for video game hunters.</resource>

Players control a man in a suit who is running from an unknown danger. The only form of interaction provided to the player is jumping to cross gaps and break through glass. It is not possible to control the man's speed. He will keep on running faster until he hits a waste bin or robot to slow down. There is also no ending to the game, as the environments are randomly generated for each playing session. The goal is to cross as large a distance as possible before dying.</resource>

As a result, these are no &amp;quot;pea-brained&amp;quot; dinosaurs -- these are dangerous creatures that are able to see, hear and sense the hunter. If you're not careful, it's very easy for the hunter to become the hunted.

With a series of different dinosaurs across varied, distinct environments (including pine forests, muddy marshes and rolling hills,) how you approach your target is important. Wind direction, scent and the use of a special dinosaur call are all key elements in tracking your prey.</resource>

Players select a club from one of many different countries and play the manager's role, taking charge of tactics, training, signing new players, negotiating contracts etc. The game is very statistics heavy and assumes a fairly deep knowledge of the football game, setting it apart from its more accessible competitors.

Since this version was released some months after the PC version it features updated stats to reflect changes in the leagues. Additionally it features new camera angles for viewing the playing field and a new interface more intuitive for the consoles.</resource>

    <resource id="b1df55bd858d5ea56252cb4e0da28cc05350bd00" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Chili Con Carnage is a semi-sequel to the PS2 game Total Overdose - the Latin-style action game by the same developer. The game recycles a lot of the levels and assets from the PS2 version, but it has new missions and a structure fine-tuned for handheld play. While the original game is a free-roaming GTA clone, the PSP version consists of a series of short missions. It focuses on the shooting sequences of Total Overdose where Ramiro uses his flashiest moves to dispatch mobs and fiends.

The main story mode, El Gringo Loco is identical to Total Overdose. The player takes on the role of Ramiro Cruz, a young man who has just witnessed his dad's murder in classic Mexican fashion «combine harvester through office wall», and now he is on a gun-fueled quest for vengeance through Mexico. The second single player mode El Macho is a collection of different mini challenges which do not tell any story but give access to different characters with different gameplay. The game also future two dynamic multiplayer modes: Hangman for up to 4 players on 1 console and Fiesta for Wi-Fi gameplay.

There is a massive amount of exotic weapons and the gameplay is over the top, with bullet-time and gravity-defying moves.</resource>

    <resource id="c91bfc746f8898318bed88b72e493f529e3295ad" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">The game idea of the circles is inspired from a war strategy called â€œChakraviguaâ€ described in the Indian epic Mahabharata. The Sanskrit word Chakravigua means Circle strategy where a battalion forms a circle around the king to protect him.

Circle puzzle is designed in similar fashion. The playerâ€™s circles (Blue small circles) are distributed in border of big circle where the objective is to move the blue circle toward zero to conquer it. Defending playerâ€™s circles (orange small circles) are distributed around the golden zero where the object is to destroy the all the blue circles. 

Moving the circle around works based on simple logic which described in game mechanics section. The player can destroy the opponent circles using simple math skills like (5+3 =?), (4-2 =?).

With the surprising apparition of the labyrinths, the whole world was changed. Many adventurers delved into these mazes, hunting for riches, and it wasn't long till the children started following their dreams of becoming heroes. To aid these children, the Adventurer Academies were founded, to prepare them in their perilous journeys.

Players start out at the Particus Academy, the newest of the academies, where they'll be able to assemble their party from students, each hailing from one of the 10 available races, 15 professions and 3 alignments. Each race has a different attitude toward the others, keeping the party compatibility system already featured in the previous games. The academy serves as a home base, where students can modify their team, purchase/sell equipment, practice alchemy, heal/revive injured party-members and take on new quests.

The labyrinths have an overall similar layout, but a few sections are randomly generated upon entrance, so are the enemy and item locations. Battles are turn-based, with a tension gauge slowly filling, allowing the party to unleash Gambits upon their foes. If the whole party is defeated in one of the labyrinths, as a last resort, a rescue team can be sent after them. The longer the rescue team takes to find them, the higher the chance that certain items will be lost, or even party members could die permanently.</resource>

The player is cast as Flint Lockwood, an aspiring inventor who tries to solve the hunger problem in his town by creating a machine that turns water into food. Soon, the machine is out of control, and it literally is raining food on Flint's town. It's up to him to stop the machine and get rid of the abundance of food. To make matters worse however, the machine is now protected by mutated food.

The player has to fight and puzzle their way through twenty levels, using Flint's self created gadgets such as a hair dryer converted into a heat gun, which can be used to melt obstacles composed of ice cream, or a mechanical boxing glove to punch food. Each level features thirty specific destroyable food items. Destroying all of them unlocks a piece of a blueprint for a special item.</resource>

    <resource id="f603da1eb7acd9d2d72e6faa154fede64100e7c8" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Coconut Dodge is an arcade game in which a player must dodge falling coconuts, weave through airborne mazes and play beach ball keepy-uppy to collect giant shiny treasures. The game starts quite easy and gradually ramps up to insane levels of coco-bullet action.

What makes the game addictive is the combination of the predictable mazes and the random coconuts and beach balls. It makes the experience similar to a racing game, where the first few attempts at a new track are difficult, but once you’ve learnt the track, you can hone your movements to perfection whilst confidently dealing with the other cars.

Coconut Dodge works in a similar way as you learn to memorise and master the mazes. Most of the mazes in the game have two different routes; one that is nice and easy, and one that is more difficult. The difficult route always has more valuable treasure in it. So, when you come across a maze you can get through it quite easily, which makes the game suitable for some quick casual play on the bus. However, to get the most treasure and a high score, you have to learn some pretty complex movements that require good rhythm and very high precision.</resource>

It continues the original premise of the four high school students who discover a computer in an abandoned factory, holding a large virtual world plagued by the virus X.A.N.A., but many of the characters' backgrounds are taken from later seasons in the series.

Players take the role of one of the four heroes from the show, Ulrich, Odd, Yumi or Aelita, and fight across the virtual environment of Lyoko and the internet against the dangerous virus X.A.N.A. and his army of monsters. Levels are accessed from a main hub and players can switch between any of the characters at any time, but they share health and energy. The characters' various weapons and abilities can be used to take them out, like Ulrich's swords, Odd's laser arrows or the ability to climb walls, or Yumi being the only one who can balance on thin ledges. Many of these skills are unlocked during the course of the game. X.A.N.A. on the Internet can be hunted down using the digital submarine Skidbladnir.</resource>

    <resource id="051d05609a3ae8eb923ffb2cfe099483d3e82809" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Corpse Party is an adventure game that uses hand-drawn 2D sprite and tile art to tell the story of a group of Kisaragi Academy High School students who are trapped in a haunted elementary school filled with the decaying corpses and tormented souls of countless children whod mysteriously vanished from the Japanese countryside years, months or sometimes only days prior. Desperately trying to escape and survive, players will experience unnatural, unnerving and decidedly uncensored horrors through the eyes and ears -- of these frightened teenaged victims. Detailed 2D sprite animations and art stills show the bloody and unsettling fates that await those who enter, and full Japanese-language voice-acting combines with 3D audio support to create a simulated surround sound experience when playing with headphones, offering players a delightfully uncomfortable level of immersion.</resource>

Join eight students and one teacher as they inadvertently invoke a powerful curse and find themselves wandering the haunted halls of Heavenly Host -- a constantly shifting echo of a tragedy-stricken elementary school that should have been torn down decades ago. With vengeful spirits lurking around every corner and an omnipresent pressure in the air threatening to break what's left of their sanity, they must race against their own impending dooms to solve the mystery of where and when they are, cataloguing the rotting corpses of their own unsuccessful predecessors all the while.
Featuring retro-styled 2D visuals, agonizingly detailed art stills, binaural 3D audio with original Japanese voices, over two dozen endings and some truly twisted depictions of death, this story-driven horror adventure is the perfect nightmare fuel.</resource>

    <resource id="2f2d7cb0649195f542b438be92007b5a3a73d791" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Cover Girl is aimed at a female audience and it is described as a 'way to become a Truly Fabulous Female'. The game starts by asking some personals details. You enter your name, date of birth, and your favourite music style. You then choose one of the three available female characters that will guide you through the game. The player then gets to access the Cover Girl magazine where the content is customized based on a number of questions. The game for instance asks you whether numbers or letters attempt you more, if you are in the mood for food choices or to release your inner child, and if you are more interested in being dressed to kill than deadweight dumping. The game then generates a Cover Girl magazine based on your preferences.

As a digital magazine the player can then read articles about the behaviour of men, horoscopes, recipes, do a tarot session, answer questions in a sex-o-meter quiz, consult the Manlation to get to know the behaviour of men, complete a Purse-onality quiz to find the perfect purse or do Sudoku puzzles. After going through a number of items a new issue becomes available with new content based on the same themes. It also includes a size translator to compare and convert the different clothes and shoes sizes around the world. There are 25 mini-games in total and over 100 quizzes. Additional magazines were unlocked afterwards and made available through the PlayStation Store.</resource>

    <resource id="98359f9604231e24825ca2cb6cf93ea742229a4e" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">This version is different from its DS and GBA versions.  The story has Crash's arch-nemeses, Neo and Nina Cortex, creating a device that turns the creatures on Crash's island into monsters, threatening to bring an end to existence on the peaceful island.  Crash must stop them by &amp;quot;hijacking&amp;quot; these monsters and wield their power against the Cortex's.

The gameplay has the player explore levels, picking up power-ups to use against enemies as well as for the first time, use fighting combos such as punches and kicks against enemies.  Players can also &amp;quot;hijack&amp;quot; 15 different enemy monsters to use against the others, each with their own special abilities and powers like fire breathing and earthquakes.  Players can also interact with their world, climbing trees and swinging from ropes and even surf and skate throughout the levels.  There is also co-op abilities where a friend can pop into the game at any point.

The games across are almost identical, excluding controls (the Wii utilizes the Wii-remote) and graphics are different depending on the systems graphics capabilities.</resource>

He shakes off a hangover to get to his graduation only to find out he's finished second to his hated rival. Then when he finally gets a lead on a job, it ends up getting him robbed and nearly killed...and that's just the beginning. Soon Killian and his new &amp;quot;acquaintances&amp;quot; will end up getting caught up in much larger events that revolve around an ancient artifact called the Wicked Stone.

Crimson Gem Saga is a turn-based RPG, with over world travel being done on an isometric plane. The game has some minor action elements sprinkled into the turn-based gameplay, like critical combo chains and an ambush system. Characters level up individually, but all draw from a group pool of skill points in order to unlock and gain new skill abilities, some of which are combination attacks. In essence, the core gameplay is very similar to a JRPG, despite the fact that the game's developed by a Korean company.</resource>

Desperate for sleep and unable to get it, he finds himself a test subject in the mad Dr. Reubens' crowning achievement, C.R.U.S.H. (or Cognitive Regression Utilizing pSychiatric Heuristics, if you prefer).  C.R.U.S.H. puts the subject under hypnosis and allows them to explore their psyche and confront their own deep, dark secrets.

Crush is a platforming game with puzzle elements.  Initially, it looks like a third person platformer, but you'll soon discover the game's hook - as Danny, you can &amp;quot;crush&amp;quot; the landscape based on the camera direction, giving you a new perspective on a previously impassable situation.  Huge gaps become mere footsteps wide, or may even disappear.  Tall buildings can be squashed flat, allowing you to walk over previously impossible terrain.  By rotating the camera with the D-Pad, you can choose to crush the level sideways, similar to a 2D platformer like Super Mario Bros., or top-down, somewhat like Bomberman.

However, there are, of course, restrictions.  Not all blocks can be crossed when crushed.  In addition to this, some blocks that you can stand on in 3D simply don't exist in 2D.  And then there's creatures lurking based on Danny's fears: giant cockroaches roam around some levels, and need to be squashed before Danny can get past them.  Some blocks contain nightmarish limbs that swipe at Danny when he gets too close.  And some blocks (representing Danny's childhood fear of building blocks) even come to life and patrol the 3D levels.</resource>

Crystal Defenders is a defensive strategy game, in which the player must guard a path using troops taken straight from the Final Fantasy job classes, such as Soldiers, Archers and Black Mages. Every enemy who traverses the entire path means another crystal lost to the party.

The game has three modes: W1 teaches the player the basics, W2 introduces Power Crystals which add a layer of strategy, and W3 is filled with more complex maps.</resource>

The game is set in a cubic world with different stages and challenges. Players control a cube through tracks that act like 3D platforms and mazes. There are 135 levels based on nine themes in total. The different themes (called zones in the game) come with their own contraptions and a specific colour. Dangers include bombs, creatures, sinking surfaces, rotating blocks, blocks that blow the cube backwards and more. Sometimes these also need to be manipulated to create new paths (e.g. moving blocks and then luring a bomb to blow it up).</resource>

This is the first in a two-game series, and some anime will only have their stories partially completed in this game. Despite this, the developer claims that Z2 will feature more missions than any other handheld SRW.  

Z2 introduces many popular series from the latter half of the previous decade, including Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann, Gundam 00, and Code Geass. However, this game also marks the debut of Armored Trooper Votoms, one of the earliest pioneers of the &amp;quot;Real Robot&amp;quot; genre of mecha anime.</resource>

Despite its billing as a two-part game, Saise-hen is entirely independent of Hakai-hen. Players will receive a starting bonus in Saise-hen based on how many times they have completed Hakai-hen, along with an extra bonus for playing all of Hakai-hen's scenarios, but unlocked machines and pilots will not transfer.

Every series from Hakai-hen returns, with their sequels/second seasons debuting if applicable. Macross 7 makes its Z-series debut, with Dynamite 7 appearing for the first time in any SRW. The only completely new series, Tetsujin 28, is the 1980s incarnation of a robot series that predates even Mazinger.</resource>

Estos estudiantes reciben título de «Superalumnos». Sin embargo, cada año, la escuela organiza un sorteo entre todos los estudiantes promedio del país, se escoge a uno al azar y entra en la academia como el «Super High School Level Good Luck» - Makoto Naegi es uno de ellos.

La historia gira alrededor de 15 estudiantes que se encuentran atrapados en la escuela bajo el control de un oso de peluche llamado Monokuma. Para escapar, los estudiantes deben «graduarse» de la escuela. Para ello, tienen que deshacerse a un compañero de clase. Después que su cuerpo haya sido descubierto por 3 estudiantes, el resto de los estudiantes deben trabajar juntos para descubrir al culpable. Si el culpable puede engañar al resto de sus compañeros de clase, él podrá graduarse de la escuela, pero el resto de los estudiantes serán castigados. Sin embargo, si los compañeros descubren el verdadero culpable, entonces sólo él será el castigado con una ejecución personalizada con su supertalento mientras todos los demás se mantienen ilesos.</resource>

The plot is set in Darius year 1904. Belser has attacked Darius, which had been revived by immigrants from planet Vadis. The game is now in 3D although it's still a left-to-right scroll-shooter . 

Darius Burst features a few elements new to the series: first of all, you don’t loose any weapon upgrades when you die. Second, there’s a 3-mode burst laser which is basically a revised version of the giant laser weapon featured in G-Darius. This time you don’t need to capture and sacrifice enemy units to use it and you may even absorb certain types of bullets with it.

There are 3 silverhawks: “Legend” (the Darius Gaiden ship) piloted by two terminals referred as TI2 and two unlockables: “Next” (a next generation model) piloted by Riga Practica and “Origin” ship which is the original silverhawk, pilot unknown. Darius Burst is shorter than previous games in the series: there are 11 levels and 8 bosses total. The game features a number of unlockable trials (&amp;quot;Mission mode&amp;quot;) and a “Burst mode” which challenges the player to complete the game with a single life.

The soundtrack is composed by Zuntata, Taito’s in-house music band.</resource>

    <resource id="eb50a2e855845a7aa11b3005a8cebeffa3c84655" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Daxter stars for the first time on his own in this action-platformer that reveals how he became a hero and freed Jak at the beginning of Jak II. Finally able to explore past the secure boundaries of Haven City, Daxter inadvertently takes on a job as a pest exterminator, a task the Old Sage intuitively knew he was proficient at since the first Jak and Daxter. Armed with a fly swatter and soon afterwards a spray canister that allows him to not only stun bugs but to hover in the air, Daxter unravels to the player the introduction of the upcoming invasion that occurred in Jak II into Haven City. The invasion is led by the Metal Heads who are using bug-like variations called Metal Bugs to permeate the city. Later upgrades include a flame thrower attachment as well as a detonator weapon.

Daxter's path towards freeing Jak involves a series of platforming and combat challenges through a wide variety of environments ranging from a high speed transit system to a fish cannery, and all the way to the Krimson Guard fortress where Daxter has to sneak past the guards to eventually save Jak.

Daxter features a variety of vehicle levels, minigames typical of the Jak series, as well as a series of dream level sequences that take Daxter into a realm where he is the hero. The dream minigames spoof cinematic moments from The Matrix, Indiana Jones, Braveheart and Lord of the Rings. Wi-fi multiplayer mode of Bug combat is included, where players can use their trained collected bugs to fight each other.</resource>

Death Jr. is a 3-D platform game in which you control Death Jr. a.k.a. DJ in an attempt to find his friends that have been taken by the evil necromancer Moloch. DJ's friend souls appear as puzzle pieces throughout the game in which you must find to bring them back.

Warp through 17 levels fighting demons and fiends using DJ's famed scythe along with other weapons like a shotgun, electric gun and even C4 Hamsters. Use DJ's scythe to not only maim and kill but to reach heights not accessible by jumping. Upgrade weapons and learn new moves (scythe combos) by collecting widgets scattered throughout the levels. The ability to destroy the environment is an advantage to DJ as the more successful hits with his scythe be it animate or inanimate his combo meter will rise allowing DJ's friend Pandora to assist in the fight.

Death Jr.'s camera is a free roaming camera that follows DJ around with the ability to snap to the position DJ is looking at the press of a button. You can also free look with the press of a button and lock on to enemies and strafe while shooting with a gun. At the end of each level you receive a report card that tells you your number of kills, how much destruction you caused, the total number of combo points, special items discovered and your final grade.</resource>

In each level you are given a laser source and its destination. You need to redirect the laser beam from its source to destination using objects like mirrors and prisms. But beware! There are valuable objects in the way, you must work around those objects and not let the laser touch them, else they will explode and you start afresh on that level. Every level poses a different difficulty, where you have been given a particular budget to buy objects. You must finish within the given budget and find your way through different obstacles that lay in between the laser and its destination. There are 90 unique levels with 3 different difficulty modes to test your puzzle skills to deflect the laser to its destination.</resource>

Battle gameplay takes place on a map divided into a square grid. The player controls a squad of humanoid units and monsters, which each occupy a single square of the grid and do combat with a group of enemies. Depending on the character and attack selected, the player will be able to deal damage to a specific enemy unit or a designated region of the map. Combat ends when all enemy units or all of the player's units are destroyed.
Humanoid characters may lift and throw other units across the map in order to allow allies to move further or force enemies to keep their distance. This even allows the player to capture enemies by throwing them into the base panel; these enemies then become allies, and can be used on subsequent maps. The chance of capturing an enemy in this manner depends on several factors. Failure to capture the enemy will result in the death of all characters inside the base panel, and the enemy will survive.</resource>

The frame story is that Lightning McQueen and his friends are trained in C.H.R.O.M.E. missions, the races, in order to defeat Professor Zundapp. 

The main racing event is battle mode in which the player races against opponents and collects power-ups on the way which either allow to perform offensive (machine guns) or defensive (e.g. a shield against enemy attacks) actions as well as speed boosts. There are various other variants of battle mode, including racing against the clock or elimination races. In contrast to the console/PC version, the cars are not freely controlled: the player can only jump between the lanes. The camera angle changes automatically during the race.

During the campaign the player will unlock a number of additional cars which differ in their control, power and speed ratings. Before tackling a new campaign mission, which have different difficulty levels assigned to them, the used car can be changed. The free play mode allows to choose between all racing modes.</resource>

    <resource id="3cff8075dfd8ac1dd3592978be81d3e050fd6984" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Downstream Panic! is a colourful puzzle game that can mixes elements from Locoroco with Worms.

A massive cyclone has sucked all of the fish out of the oceans! The player must safely guide them back. Levels start at the top of the area where the fish are contained in a blob of water. They need to reach the ocean safely at the bottom of the screen with guidance of the player.

Using a variety of creative tools like fans, onions, rockets, and cloud factories, the fish can be guided through platforms, past hungry sharks, piranhas and many other dangers. The tools can also be used to control the flow of the water and the direction the fish travel. Plants will stop the flow and by blowing flowers bridges are opened. At the start of the level, the area usually needs to be scanned first using the free camera perspective to discover all the hazards. Certain fish can be sacrificed, but a sufficient number of them needs to reach the ocean.

The regular mode eventually unlocks the Free Play and Survival modes. In Free Play the player can spend the money from regular games to buy tools for the stages. In survival all levels are replayed in succession, but lost fish are not regained in the next level.</resource>

Another mode is the Arcade mode, a single-player mode that lets you brawl against the CPU in order to fight and gain the Dragon Balls. Next is the Z trial mode, which consists of two different types of play: survival, where you fight against CPU-controlled opponents for as long as you can, and time attack, where you see how fast you can make it through a predetermined set of opponents.

Finally, there?s the Profile Card mode in which the players will have their in-game character profile cards that lists their name and power level. The player can design their own card and customize them with the items from the game's item store.</resource>

    <resource id="16ac59337bce5770304cecce28a68863f588547f" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Take control of the zany characters from the animated film Over the Hedge in a brand new storyline that continues where the film left off. When Hammy's cable television conks out, he and his friends must once again brave the dangers of suburbia to get it back. They fall in with a mischievous beaver, who keeps devising more and more daring heists to keep the food and entertainment flowing. But is he really as friendly as he seems? Playing as Hammy, RJ, and Verne, players must fight sewer rats, evade high-tech security systems, navigate suburban obstacles, slow the world down with caffeine-powered Hammy Time, steal tons of food, and ultimately save the neighborhood over the course of ten levels.

The game also features 4-player multiplayer, with a set of quick-playing heist games. Players drop into a room filled with delicious food, and collect as much as they can before their opponents can get to it. If players are too slow, they're out of luck, unless they sneak up behind their opponents and smack the food right out of their hands!</resource>

    <resource id="ec3d411e1c25b70ac66da497413242177b6163b2" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">The Frog King has died and Shrek has inherited the throne. Since Shrek's not a big fan of this idea, he and his friends journey to the Worcestershire academy to recruit Fiona's cousin, Artie, for the job. Unfortunately, while he's away the dastardly Prince Charming has big plans to take over the kingdom.

SHReK the THiRD is an action-platformer with a heavy emphasis on brawling and humor. With plenty of Prince Charming's goons in his path (including black knights, evil gnomes, a crooning Captain Hook, and giant walking trees), Shrek will have to use all of his abilities to defeat them, find his way home, and pick up some souvenir mugs along the way.

Each level features several quests, lots of collectibles, and funny situations. While most of the levels feature Shrek himself, there are six playable characters in total (Donkey, Puss in Boots, Fiona, Artie, and Sleeping Beauty feature as well), over 20 levels, three big boss battles, and several multiplayer minigames.</resource>

The gameâ€™s concept is centered on the idea of controlling two player ships simultaneously (on a single PSP or PS3 controller) across single player and 2-player co-operative and adversarial game modes.

In all modes your ships (one red, one blue) are tasked with destroying wave upon wave of red and blue enemies; the idea being to survive, waste the bad guys and attain the highest score possible. Some of your enemies will cause chain reactions or change other enemiesâ€™ colors, so picking out the best shots will really help you survive and rack up those high scores!</resource>

As an officer in a Chinese army, you fight and kill thousands of soldiers in massive battles stretched over numerous battlefields - either in the campaign &amp;quot;Musou&amp;quot; modes or the single battle &amp;quot;Free&amp;quot; mode which can be used to train.

New to this PSP version is a bodyguard system where your selected second officer can give you certain items or abilities, for example one ensures you always have a horse when entering an area.and others can give you special powered up Musou attacks.</resource>

This time around levels take place in a 2D side-scrolling environment, as opposed to the original's 3D spaces, and each level has a timer imposed on it, its length varying around 30 to 50 seconds. The objective is still reaching the end of the level, overcoming with the help of the time bounces: each time the timer runs out, the player is placed back at the start of the level, but shadows will also appear, which carry out actions performed by the player in the past.</resource>

Throughout the world are prisms that the player has to pick up, although they are optional to finish a level. Each level is full of traps where the player can fall if he does not manage to roll his cube from a platform to another in the right time. After a level has been completed the player gets a rating based on how many times he has failed, the number of prisms he has picked up and how long it has taken.</resource>

    <resource id="4d5b75ce5c53a2ef2c62c2df91e1192de0c1a3b7" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">In Eragon, based on the movie of the same name, which is in turn based on the book Eragon, by Christopher Paolini, the player controls Saphira, Eragon's dragon companion and friend, and her task is to help him along 9 different levels in which you will be killing enemies, protecting allies, racing through narrow corridors and clearing pathways. Saphira can attack, brake, reverse course and use boost to cross long distances. The main means of attack are her talons, used to grab enemies or larger objects to bomb everything on the ground below. There is also a selection of offensive and defensive spells. Health is replenished by eating livestock.

There are 6 arena levels unlocked by playing through the singleplayer campaign. These are multiplayer stages where you can fight versus as many as three bots or human players in 12 different game modes. The PSP version is completely different game than those for the other platforms, focusing only on Saphira the dragon while the others prominently feature the hero Eragon.</resource>

    <resource id="fddcf87dfbbf3b4fbadda0b25f8f38cec85dc4f3" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Every Extend Extra is a remake of the popular freeware game Every Extend and in all main aspects of gameplay it sticks to its independent roots. The main difference between E3 and the original game is E3's music adaptation, just like the other Tetsuya Mizuguchi's synesthesia titles (Lumines and Rez). E3's main arcade mode allows the player to advance through different stages, each of them featuring different background, enemy designs, music, bosses and a varying pace of play.

As in the original game you too are unable to shoot. The only way of defense is to detonate your &amp;quot;ship&amp;quot; in the vicinity of the enemy. Enemies appear in randomized patterns, and the main goal is to detonate at the right moment and position, to set up a chain reaction of explosions and earning a combo bonus. Blowing oneself up takes away from your overall stock of lives, with a new life being issued at specific amounts of points.

The original game has been included with the PSP version as well.</resource>

Many of these shoot at you, so dodge their shots as you attack them.

Modeled after the original PS3 game it changes a few things for the portable format. The game requires a PSP camera and a &amp;quot;magic card&amp;quot; (included within the game package) to play. By pointing the PSP with the camera attached on the magic card the player makes the cute creature appear on screen. The player can play a variety of games with the pet, such as bowling, fishing or jumping on trampolines. The game encourages playing in different environments; by doing so the player has a chance of finding &amp;quot;treasures&amp;quot; - customization items. In a separate in-game area called Pet home the player may take care of the pet - feed it, wash it etc. and also change its appearance to their liking.</resource>

For 06, the players are more responsive and crucial features like first touch control have been re-mapped in a way that makes more sense. When you want to throw freestyle moves or play the ball into a space of your choosing as a pass comes to you, just hold down the left shoulder button and point the analog stick to pull your move or use first touch. The new Juggling minigame is another major addition to FIFA for PSP. It's a simple game that merely requires that you tap in a proper direction on the D-pad with proper timing to keep a soccer ball bouncing off of a player's feet, knees, shoulder and head for as long as possible.</resource>

There are seven different covers of FIFA 07, each with a different player, depending on which region the game is sold in. Ronaldinho (FC Barcelona) graced the cover of all the games and was joined by Landon Donovan (Los Angeles Galaxy) and Francisco Fonseca (UANL Tigres) in North America; Wayne Rooney (Manchester United) in the United Kingdom, Australia, and the Benelux; Lukas Podolski (Bayern Munich) in Germany; David Villa (Valencia) in Spain; KakÃ¡ (Milan) in Italy; Juninho (Lyon) in France; Tranquillo Barnetta (Bayer Leverkusen) in Switzerland; and Kim Nam-Il (Suwon Samsung Bluewings) in South Korea.

There are also changes to how the defensive line is formed, as well as improvements to crosses, freekicks and goalkeepers (who can now receive red cards).

Naturally the game retains its hugely successful on and offline multiplayer modes, with new options and better stability for online play. The manager mode has also seen a massive update to make it just as deep and complex as the main game. With all these new features and more EA Sports are betting on FIFA remaining the champions for a long time to come.</resource>

    <resource id="280398d0baf54c0867d47d493cddd5c5bcc24a68" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Fading Shadows is a unique puzzle game for the PSP where the player leads an orb through 40 different levels by controlling a beam of light. This beam acts like a magnet to attract the orb, and can be widened or narrowed for different effects. The orb can be changed into 3 different states: metal, wood and glass. In order to solve complex puzzles and overcome obstacles, the player must utilize all the different transformations of the orb and master control over the beam of light.

The game story revolves around a young boy named Erwyn, who has been captured and imprisoned by the evil Master Gardal. The boy's soul is pure and untainted, and if Gardal sacrifices Erwyn then Gardal may breach the gates of the Castle of Heaven - a fortress built to protect the world from dark forces. However, Erwyn's clairvoyant sister has sealed his soul within a protective orb, and it is her job to free the orb from captivity and guide it safely to the Castle of Heaven.</resource>

    <resource id="f2b3d3a3109f2cb0610a71a5d4301c535256912e" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">This game is based on the animated television series Family Guy. It was also released for the PlayStation 2 and the original Xbox.

The game is split into 22 levels for the three playable characters: Peter, Stewie or Brian. Peter and Stewie have eight levels, while Brian has six. Each character has his own unique style of play.

A key feature of the game are mini-games done in the same style as the cutaway gags that the show is famous for, usually lasting less than 10 seconds. The mini-games often repeat cutaway gags from the shows, such as Peter inexplicably burning his hand in a waffle iron. Successfully completing the mini-game offers a bonus: Brian becomes invisible for a short period, while Peter and Stewie receive power-ups for their respective abilities.</resource>

In the game the player has to produce a specific amount of goods within a given time. The basic action is planing grass to feed the animals. The animals will produce basic goods (e.g. hens will lay eggs) which can be sold in the city. Basic products can be processed to more valuable goods (e.g. eggs to egg powder and egg powder to cakes). Between the levels there is an upgrade shop where the player can spend stars to improve buildings and farm helpers.</resource>

The player's goal is to rescue a beloved princess from the enemy castle. There is a catch, though; the adversary has been feeding her magical cake to make her heavier to carry. Therefore, it will take much of the army working together to carry her across the battlefield. Team balance and strategy is crucial in Fat Princess: Fistful of Cake because players can switch between five different character classes, literally, at the drop of a hat. The name of the game is cooperation, whether it is flinging another player over the enemy's walls with a teeterboard, healing him while he charges into battle, or adding muscle to carry the hearty princess to safety. The comical, quirky, and loveable cast of characters in Fat Princess: Fistful of Cake has been developed specifically for optimization on the PSP. Now players can have their cake and take it on the go, too.</resource>

As with its predecessor, the game was developed by Image Epoch in collaboration with TYPE-MOON. The scenario was written by Kinoko Nasu, with Takashi Takeuchi as the character designer and Arco Wada as the illustrator. 

The protagonist, Hakuno has to look for a way to escape from the world, together with his/her Servant. The story is told in different chapters from Caster's point of view with the chapter's title accompanied by description and picture related to the boss of the chapter.

Fate/Extra CCC utilizes the same turn-based, rock-paper-scissors style combat as it's predecessor with some slight tweaks. The combat UI's appearance has changed and occupies a different place on the screen. New voice lines and animations have been added for the Servants' attacks and players can now escape from battles and the floor of the dungeon they are on.</resource>

It is the third boxing title in the Fight Night franchise. It features the usual improvements such as better graphics and gameplay. &amp;quot;Impact Punches&amp;quot; are one of the most drastic changes, along with ESPN Classic fights and a new career mode, in which the player fights to gain popularity in order to reach sponsored fights, or to be featured on ESPN. Unlike in older versions, Round 3 defaults without a heads-up display (HUD), allowing a player to judge the status of their stamina and energy based on their stance, movements, and facial features, instead of the usual stamina meter.</resource>

The gamebook's complete 400-section text has been retained with selectable hyperlinks (and lots of reading!), along with its original interior illustrations, but there is interesting new material as part of the presentation: character generation is enacted through (shades of Ultima) a tarot card reading of sorts; additionally, players can choose to resolve combat and test against their stats (the FF gold standard SKILL, STAMINA and LUCK) through the total randomness of simulated die-rolls or by participating in a more involved tile-matching memory minigame. Of course, inventory and stat adjustment are fully automated.</resource>

    <resource id="e39ce6b1e09ad0c396056e41e7be8d7ed2f7b773" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Back in 1987, Hironobu Sakaguchi's Final Fantasy was supposed to be the last game in the Fantasy role-playing game series. However, destiny had other plans for Hironobu Sakaguchi and his creation. After twenty years and more than a dozen of canonical games the Final Fantasy franchise is still going strong and reaping the rewards of the original IP.

The original Final Fantasy game has already been re-released many times. The PSP version has been built upon the Game Boy Advance version of the game. It has bonus dungeons from the Gameboy/Wonderswan versions of the game but also features new improved graphics, all in 16:9 with easy to read big texts and better quality of music and general sounds. The CG intro from the PlayStation/Wonderswan version has also been redone in 16:9.

There is an entirely new dungeon dubbed &amp;quot;The Labyrinth of Time&amp;quot; which enforces a time limit within which you can explore its dark depths, and also another bonus: an unlockable Yoshitaka Amano Art Gallery which contains beautiful artwork from the artist who has provided the illustrations for many games in the series, and like in the GBA version there is also bestiary and a unlockable BGM music player. Other features do not change the GBA version much, even the the difficulty is the same as in Dawn of Souls.</resource>

    <resource id="faa86419c2bc3dbc2f6ff1d43e4d3ec215a4b17b" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Floating Cloud God Saves the Pilgrims is a Playstation Mini game for PSP and Vita.  

Floating Cloud God Saves the Pilgrims is exactly that, a 2D shooter built around the eponymous deity (controlled by the player) and his quest to protect eight pilgrims in their journey across perilous territories.

Your own shots just knock their hats off, but getting hit by anything else will kill a pilgrim and send their spirit floating off with a sad little wail. This is bad not only because the pilgrims are a de facto health bar (losing them all ends the game) but powering up Cloud God depends on harvesting their love - juicy little hearts that pop up whenever you kill an enemy and increase in size as you blast more.

You must get all of the love (given form as hearts) that they release, which then makes you much more powerful than you already are. You increase in size, look more menacing, and your attacks are more powerful. The pilgrims get the most excited when they witness ambushing ghosts and ghouls get annihilated by you. When they are excited, they produce more love, meaning more power to you.

However, you have to be very careful when shooting. You grow weaker with every shot, so try not to channel your inner war-freak and have a little restraint, for the good of both yourself and the pilgrims. You also lose some of your steam if you get hit by enemy forces. And sometimes, the situation calls to for you to sacrifice your mightiness and provide cover to the pilgrims from the enemy assault with your own self.

There are two types of attack: the normal shot (by pressing X), and the bomb shot (by pressing Circle). The direction of the normal shot depends on what direction you are pressing, so there is some strategy to what part of the screen you should be shooting from. Being too far from your pilgrims is very dangerous but allows you to cover more ground, while launching a full frontal assault can protect your pilgrims by absorbing all the incoming fire. You have to think through, in real time, what tactics you would like to employ. You can always get in the middle, then rush forward, then get to a safe distance; mix and match, and you got yourself going.

The bomb shot is used if you are above the enemy. But thatâ€™s not all, as some enemies canâ€™t be killed with the bomb shot, only with the normal shot, and vice versa. There are also enemies where you have to inflict bomb shot damage first before switching to the normal shot to take them out.

Enemies are varied, and they look good, even if they are vile and evil. There are boss fights, too, to keep you on your toes.  The Cloud God's powers and the heart system mesh so well that any enemy can be destroyed in a blink - so they've got to be deceptive, sneaky, and sometimes numerous. Paper lanterns send out an arcing flame on death, red-eyed foxes hide in the scenery, imps swoop to carry off unlucky pilgrims and bobbing doll heads send out swarms of kisses. Hands start clawing up from the ground, crows dive-bomb your crew, and demons with phallic noses launch them as languorous, looping rockets. The cheeky oriental stylings are gorgeous, transforming symbols into everything from freaky momiji to dick-nosed devils.

As this suggests, one of the reasons Floating Cloud God is such a pleasure to play is its visual inventiveness, which has room enough for everything from Wario tributes to what looks like a crying poo. This big lump of a thing, which is introduced in a level called The Saddest Enemy, explodes into gobbets of mini-poo that are very useful for building up a heart multiplier. Perhaps they're babies? That would explain the sadness.

Floating Cloud God has bags more where that came from, and despite the Minis tag has plenty of room to breathe (there are seven worlds with 27 stages, including boss fights). And it keeps on surprising. The controls are simplicity itself: left stick to move, one button to shoot and one to bomb. But you soon realise the subtlety of how shooting affects movement and vice-versa, which fairly soon you're depending on against every enemy pattern. The pilgrims, too, are loosely tied to Cloud God during some sections, and learning how to manage their momentum is another little learning curve.

The final touch is a minor detail that ties up everything. The pilgrims' hats can be improved. There's no in-game benefit to this, beyond looking much more awesome, and it's done by completing stages without losing a single pilgrim. Obviously, if you start this process on the first level and never lose a pilgrim, the hats just keep getting better.

Seems like such a small thing, doesn't it? Soon nothing but a perfect run will do. The restart option is accessible, knowing, and tempting. Every time a pilgrim fell, it was too much to take - I didn't see their tiny spirit float off to heaven so much as all my future headwear ambitions. And to be fair, by that point I had four dudes with top hats, two with octopus heads and two with space hero helmets. You can't be replacing any of them with Norman and his brown cap just because some demon gets a lucky shot in.

That's the best thing about Floating Cloud God Saves the Pilgrims. You do want to save them, and not just because they represent 'health'. The hats are a big part of it, but just as much is the sense of pride in being a badass god - harvesting power at the right moment to smash through oncoming waves, battling desperate rear-guard actions against hails of deadly kisses and throwing yourself in bodily as a last resort (which sometimes works!). The little yelp as a pilgrim goes down is a sharp reprimand, a blow to the daydreams of an all-conquering deity.

It features over 180 different levels. Playing as one of the heroes, the objective of the game is to collect as many gems as possible in order to advance in the world of Frantix. Though there is no story explaining why our hero is venturing through this land of puzzles, it is clear that this must be done as quickly as possible. Each stage has a gem requirement, and you can exit when you have found the required amount. The puzzles are usually based on colored gems that open specific doors.

There are six worlds (including a tutorial) where you get past hazards such as water and quick sands, avoid patrolling creatures, collect gems, manipulate crates, sneak around, build bridges, and plant explosives. There are also power-ups that allow you to walk over certain surfaces, increase speed, or provide invincibility. With short levels, Frantix can be played for five minutes or an hour with the same satisfaction.</resource>

The main mode is Mission, where players need to jump gaps, make tricks, grind rails and pick stars. Completing the different challenges is rewarded with money, exchanged for basic equipment (skis, boots, helmets) and style equipment (jackets, goggles, gloves) at the shop. It also opens up new slopes and mountains. In Freeride the aim is to get the highest score, opening up slopes and mountains, there are four mountains in total, and earning endurance points. Bone Ride has the player collect bones against a time limit to earn balance points and beating courses in the Slope Style mode requires the player to reach a pre-defined score to receive trick skill points. These different game modes are grouped in the main Career, Single race and Multiplayer sections.

Mostly about tricks, players need to take care of their landings - touch the ground with back, front or side weight and a lower score multiplier is awarded. Next to the basic information on the screen such as time, score and stunts, the game also keeps track of your &amp;quot;flow&amp;quot;, by doing consecutive tricks. There are six different characters and the arsenal of tricks includes flips, rolls, carve/cross skis, grabs, rails, jumps and specials.</resource>

Set across multiple high and low rise urban environments, Parkour participants (known as traceurs) navigate around and over various obstacles using only the natural abilities of the human body. By stringing together spectacular gymnastic style moves, the player builds up 'flow', and is awarded points according to their agility and grace.

In the single player story mode, the players creates a novice traceur, who is mentored by Parkour athletes from Urban Freeflow, and by the Parkour guru Sebastian Foucan.

In addition, there are numerous single and multiplayer challenge modes - races, collection events, style based challenges, timed events and more.

Successful completion of challenges unlocks new levels, videos, clothing, footwear and music tracks.</resource>

    <resource id="15c8ce69612ca8c2a43ecf502952def9c1513b8a" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Full Auto 2: Battlelines is the sequel to the auto racing combat game Full Auto, that debuted in February of 2006 on the Xbox 360. 

The PSP version of the sequel builds on the PS3 version but removes a few features for obvious reasons, resulting in more primitive damage modeling on the cars, less detailed environments and less multiplayer modes. This version does add new gameplay modes, new cars, weapons and a different storyline.

The game plays much like a mixture of Burnout and Twisted Metal. The PSP version focuses more on the Twisted Metal-style combat gameplay. During most events, winning a race is rarely a goal; the game is focused on destruction. The goals change from level to level, but most time they require eliminating a set number of enemies, or blowing up specific targets, random objects, or oncoming traffic. Unlike the PS3 version every objective needs to be completed to win the event.

The game contains two general game modes: Racing and Arena. The 'Unwreck' feature is also present and it allows the player to rewind time. The environment is however much less interactive. Most objects cannot be destroyed, only specific ones, for instance a lead pipe that lands on chasing cars. Most destruction is done to store fronts, bus stops, trash cans and other objects.

The game contains four-player Ad Hoc multiplayer. Players can race or fight in a free-for-all arena or as part of a team in multiplayer modes such as Head-On, Down &amp; Back, as well as Arena Deathmatch.</resource>

    <resource id="3e31458f9fad8969828fa5e9efca2d5373afc174" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">WipEout Pure is the first adaptation for the PSP of the long-running Wipeout series. Players take part in a futuristic racing league known as the FX300 Racing League and control a fast hovercrafts on tight, cornering tracks, vying for first place in one of many tournaments. There are ten anti-gravity vehicles available to use (two need to be unlocked), each with their own characteristics in speed, handling and acceleration. Vehicles are further divided into classes that are unlocked gradually. In later classes most of the vehicles become much faster and require more precise steering at fast speeds. In the same vein, players can unlock new tournaments.

There are a total of sixteen tracks to race on: twelve designed from the ground up for the PSP, as well as four classic Wipeout tracks. Each track has its own obstacles, as well as weapon pick-ups (both offensive and defensive) and speed boosters. The different game modes include single races, tournaments of sets of races, time trial and zone races. In the zone races the player goes through a number of increasingly difficult zones on his own without the ability to slow down until the vehicle explodes because of collision damage. New game elements are unlocked through the Tournament mode.

The game features wireless play over ad-hoc mode (PSP-to-PSP). It was also the first PSP game to support downloadable content with extra teams, tracks and PSP skins. Some of these packs are only available for specific regional versions. The European version of the game supports game sharing.</resource>

    <resource id="8f425e61a90ba8e81a868febfb9d0b130f451ce2" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">In Gangs of London the player takes the role of a crime gang member who wants to take control over London. The basic gameplay premise reminds of the GTA series but instead of a free roaming experience the campaign consists of 70 short missions which are chosen through a menu screen. Every of them is accompanied with a story sequence in a comic style and features varied goals: escorting, infiltrating an enemy post, stealing cars, kidnapping people, racing, defending the own position against enemy waves and killing people.

The gameplay itself offers what one would expect from a game like this: if the player is on foot the game is basically a third person shooter - sometimes he has a few other gang members with him and can give them a few commands. The driving is action oriented in either first or third person and the stealth segments are basic and require only to perceive the guard's patrols and kill them from behind. The police intervenes if they see a crime but there is no wanted system like in similar games. At the beginning of the campaign the player has a choice between five gangs with different abilities, e.g. the Triads can drive faster.

Additionally the game features a big selection of playing modes and mini games, e.g. free roaming in London, driving taxi, photographing points of interests as tourist or fighting off zombies. The mini games in the pub can be played with two players: darts, bowling, pool and a Snake variant as arcade machine, The last noteworthy mode is a tactical game similar to Risk: The player takes control over a crime organization and tries to conquer London which is divided into about 30 districts. In every round he can perform three actions, e.g. move men to another district. Between rounds he can hire more men or acquire bonus cards which give certain advantages. There are three difficulty levels and several winning conditions for this mode.</resource>

You are Johnny Blaze, who sold his soul to a demon named Mephisto for noble reasons.  Now, some rogue demons have escaped from hell and Mephisto needs to to destroy them before they cause him trouble.  If you don't, he'll take your girlfriend back to hell with him.

Ghost Rider attacks with his flaming hellfire chains in a manner similar to God of War.  If he uses a variety of moves and avoids being hit, it fills a vengeance bar.  The more this meter fills, the more souls he gets from enemies he kills.  Souls are used to purchase new moves and extras like additional characters.  There are some shielded enemies where you must have a minimum vengeance bar to damage them.  There is also a spirit gauge, which is essentially a special meter and is also built up by attacking.  It allows the uses of special moves, like your shotgun.

There are also Hellcycle levels, where you must successfully avoid obstacles while destroying enemies with the bike's hellshots attacks and your chains.</resource>

Pen and paper is no longer required as the game comes pre-loaded with 1000 Sudoku puzzles, with the option to download additional puzzles from the game's website.

The actual game of Sudoku is fairly simple, and has nothing to do with mathematics at all - instead, it's all to do with logic. The numbers one to nine must fit horizontally and vertically in the 9x9 Sudoku grid - the catch is that the numbers one to nine must also appear in each of the nine smaller 3x3 grids.

The game features a short tutorial that shows you how to play, as well as a Training option which lets you play five easy puzzles with help. Multiplayer mode is also supported either by taking turns with one system (either co-operatively or competitively), or by playing wirelessly with up to four PSPs.</resource>

They are all exact conversions with some minor changes. While some versions had two-player co-op gameplay, all games in this compilation are single-player only. The triangle button is used for rapid fire, to combine shooting the regular weapon along with missiles.

The extras include videos from Gradius Deluxe Pack, Gradius III and IV and Gradius Gaiden. There is also a music gallery where the full soundtrack of the five included games is available. The games have also been adapted for different views (zoomed in and full) and the arcade ports include full options. A basic save and autosave system has also been implemented.</resource>

The player can pick and choose circuits and vehicles, with credits earned based on the difficulty, performance and number of laps they have chosen. Players can select from any number of laps, one to 99. There are 45 tracks (including layout variations) plus the added bonus of reverse on most tracks, which takes the track number close to 75. For the first time in the series, the game features the use of custom soundtracks that enables players to play their own songs while racing, but this option must first be unlocked by completing section B of the Driving Challenges.

Just like in the original game the player controls a hurricane in an attempt to steer polluted clouds into cleansing factories, to create cleaner air and thwart global warming. Polluted clouds are sent out gradually and these are drawn towards the hurricane that can move about freely on the screen. By moving the hurricane and keeping track of all pollution, the clouds need to be steered into the factories. Borrowing from the mechanics of Tower Defense games, the pollution needs to be moved away from high pressure zones. These zones immediately absorb the pollution and disperse it, adding 10% to the global warming percentage. Similarly, having pollution touch the hurricane yields a 20% percentage. When 100% is reached, Earth is destroyed and the game is over.</resource>

Released only six months after the previous PSP game, this version comes with updated rosters and several features taken from the PS2 version, but has its own selection of modes.

Returning modes include single games and a full season. The new chemistry feature makes its way over from the PS2, influencing players' stats depending on how well they interact with each other. Also seen on the PS2 is the &amp;quot;Wayne vs Wayne&amp;quot; mode, in which the two competing teams build up their &amp;quot;99 meter&amp;quot;. When full, The Great One himself joins the team as an extra player for a short time. In addition to single games, this mode can also be played in the PSP-exclusive NHL Showdown mode, which is a ladder against all NHL teams, with the finale against a team of five Gretzkys. Another exclusive mode is called &amp;quot;3 on 3 Countdown&amp;quot;. It is an arcade mode, with only three players per team on the field, without any of the regular rules, and the winner being the team that reaches a set score first.

Online multiplayer, both ad hoc and via infrastructure, also return, as do the Gretzky Challenges: by earning points through in-game achievements, players can unlock bonuses like alternate and vintage uniforms and new gameplay features and modes. Unlike the previous PSP game, Gretzky 06 features color and play-by-play commentary by Mike Emrick and Darren Pang.</resource>

The game is built around a tour mode where the player must complete the stages one by one. Clear these stages by driving fast to the finish or try to top the times required to obtain bronze, silver, and gold medals. There are also stars to collect and a hidden item on every stage to discover. All of the levels are afloat in the air, so if the player happens to drift off the course, the car drops into nothingness.

There are many multiplayer modes, including bonus games such as soccer, ice hockey and a Snake game played with cars. In the track editor, players can construct their own gravity-defying tracks and share them through a wireless connection.</resource>

The game sees players having to clear lines of three or more blocks of the same color, and like Columns players can cycle through the falling lines of blocks, with adjacent blocks of the same color also disappearing with the matched lines. In addition, extra points can be scored when players bring their falling blocks down to the downbeats (called &amp;quot;Superbeats&amp;quot;) of the game's electronica soundtrack, adding to a score multiplier.

By setting high scores, players collect stars to unlock new songs and power-ups. Unlike most puzzle games which are played to infinity, each stage in Groovin' Blocks lasts for the duration of the song if the player has not yet failed the stage by filling their play area with blocks.</resource>

    <resource id="f09437247993fbd5ddb34553e3431005968c14e2" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Wayfarer of Time features an isometric perspective and a &amp;quot;traditional RPG&amp;quot; style exploration in towns, dungeons and world map that are very similar to the original Growlanser. Enemies can be seen on the world map and they can be avoided. Each dungeon has a unique, fixed layout (with the exception of the &amp;quot;bonus dungeon&amp;quot;, which is randomly generated).

The equipment system is markedly different from most RPGs. Characters can equip two pieces of armor, one being a &amp;quot;Ring Weapon&amp;quot;. In the Growlanser series, a Ring Weapon is a new technology where magic rings transform into different weapons depending on the user's personality. Players find these rings often after the defeat of an enemy and can equip different rings for different stat bonuses and different gem-equip slots. There are over 100 types of gems that cause various beneficial effects such as adding extra attacks, more elemental defenses, or increasing range or adding spells to the character's repertoire. These gems all have an innate level and that level must match or be lower than the slot available in the Ring weapon to be equipped. Each Ring Weapon only has 3 gem-slots with a level of 0-9 for each slot to equip the respective level gems. Additionally, a gem's color must match the color of a ring slot. A gem can be equipped into any given slot, however, penalties are incurred if the gem has a skill that can be learned.

There are 11 potential playable characters, but there is a four-member party limit in battles. The fate system allow players to save some characters from death based on their decisions and ultimately unlock some additional endings.</resource>

Segments appear at the bottom of the field, and if a segment reaches the top, the game is over. Unlike the original's Western theme, this version has an abstract theme, with extra skins unlocked through play.

The PSP version features a Challenge mode (with changing skins), single skin and double skin modes (which let you choose the skins to use), a 10x10 mode (with a correspondingly larger field), quick start, time attack (best score in 60, 90, or 120 seconds), and a two-player (wireless) mode. Two different rule sets are included; original, and break, which automatically drops segments down if a line is formed below them.</resource>

Acting as the leader of a territory from the Egyptian Empire, players manage all aspects of its rise, from economic growth to political power, the development of armies, and expansion into other regions by war and diplomacy. 

Empires are controlled from three main views: the Campaign Map shows the entire game world, including mountains, forests, coastlines, oceans, rivers, cites, and armies. The City Map gives players an overview of the structure and role of a city within the empire, and provides a basis for economic decisions. The Battle Map is to be used when diplomacy has run its course or when a city is being attacked, resulting in turn-based combat. 

All nations, cities and armies were carefully researched to ensure historical accuracy. The game is accessible for new users, while offering deeper gameplay for expert players.</resource>

Unlike Half-Minute Hero, the sequel's episodes all consist of RPG gameplay similar to the Hero 30 mode of the original. However, they have been expanded with additional features more similar to a typical RPG, such as an explorable world, leveling outside of battle, weapon combining, formations, special classes, a more developed plot line and a home base, the Hero Castle, that doubles as a giant mecha.</resource>

There are four different casinos in which to play, each with its own games, house rules and table limits. Players start with a modest amount of money in the Hard Rock. The object is, naturally, to win lots more and earn a high enough reputation to be able to play in invitation-only tournaments and high stakes games. The major goal is to become the &amp;quot;Hard Rock High Roller&amp;quot;.

There are unique, and sometimes influential, NPC characters to meet and play against, side tasks to complete, and unlockables for enhancing your customized character. The game also features a tutorial accessed from the main menu.</resource>

Most notable of which is that the game now uses the D-pad (arrow buttons) and a &amp;quot;hold and release&amp;quot; function for the face buttons in addition to the normal gameplay. Similar to the symbols of the first game, the game now includes colored arrows for example a blue arrow pointing downwards, this indicates that the player has to press &amp;quot;down&amp;quot; on the D-Pad and the &amp;quot;Cross&amp;quot; face button at the same time. The game also add a fourth difficulty, Extreme, to songs that is more difficult than the hard difficulty in the first game. The game will also introduce duets, as compared to only having solo songs in the first game, thus allowing players to select two modules instead. This also carries on into the Edit Mode of the game allowing players to create PVs for duets with two modules in them.</resource>

These modules, though not directly controlled by the player, will be the ones appearing in the music videos throughout the game including their specific costumes. For example, if the player chooses Kagamine Rin for their first character and Hatsune Miku for their second character, during solo songs only Kagamine Rin appears in the video but for duets both Hatsune Miku and Kagamine Rin will appear in the video. Each of the songs have their own difficulties which are Easy, Normal, Hard and Extreme. Initially both the Easy and Normal difficulties of a song are unlocked, upon clearing the Normal difficulty, the Hard difficulty will be unlocked and so forth.

It features the ImpactCam, which lets you watch the effects of your destruction up close and personal, avoiding the long-distance 'blip killing' often found in other flight games.

Players take on the role of pilot, Mike 'Downtown' Hudson, who flies for the International Council's Air Force. A dictator has launched a terrorist attack - you are part of the response to fight sea and airborne enemies in an attempt to avert an international crisis. Missions take place on locations all over the world.

Heatseeker's arcade presentation includes infinite ammo, huge kill counts, a colourful, saturated look, and over-the-top characters and scenarios.</resource>

The story is unique to the game, and sees Hellboy travel through six different settings as he tracks down the evil Von Klempt. Hellboy faces his familiar enemies including various demons and Nazi creations. The game features brawler style action, with some puzzle and story elements interspersed throughout.

In The Science of Evil, Hellboy has several abilities that set him apart from the standard brawler character, including the ability to pick up and wield many environmental objects such as barrels and debris from structures knocked down with his Right Hand of Doom. He can also grapple enemies to finish them off one-on-one, or use them as projectiles.

Team up with a friend and attempt six co-op multiplayer levels over ad-hoc WiFi. These levels are derived from the single-player campaign, but have been shortened and re-worked to provide a set of two-player puzzles. Scores are tracked individually - so it doesn't have to be completely co-operative.

Hellboy: The Science of Evil was also released on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, however the PSP version is not a port of that game. The story elements and characters are similar, but the PSP features a unique combat system, different AI and a new level layout more suited to the handheld environment.</resource>

The game allows you to play all the great battles from Roman history. In between missions you can watch (up to 50 minutes of) TV footage from The History Channel's documentaries on Rome. Additionally, the story of Marcus Aurelius is completely voice-acted as well. Gameplay is similar to Slitherine's previous game Legion Arena: You control your armies in real time on a 3D map. There is no resource gathering or city building, but at the end of every battle you are given points which can be used to purchase new units and upgrade surviving units which you bring along to the next battle.

The game features 14 different campaigns portraying over a 100 different battles. There are 20 different types of units which can all be customized with different skills and clothing.</resource>

Maps are based on user selections, with geographical particularities randomized within those parameters. The player controls the dragon with two thumbsticks, one to fly and one to direct a stream of cleansing fire emerging from the dragon's mouth -- over crops, windmills, merchant carts, archers and all sorts of targets. Winnow your target down to extinction after a few fiery gasps and all that is left in their wake is a small mound of treasure, to be collected and returned to the dragon's home base on the map, its hoard, where players can heal and upgrade one of four abilities -- Speed, Breath, Treasure Capacity, and Armor -- when not defending their gold-pile from thieves and driving off would-be princess-rescuing knights.

Game modes include Treasure Hunt (a drive to maximise income in a set time limit), Princess Rush (striving to reach a set number of Princess ransoms), Survival (see how long you can survive) and Co-op.</resource>

    <resource id="b0d80e3a091f1eaf0581917dd83e49c5d271dded" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Hot Pixel is a casual game happening in a pixellized universe mixed from street culture, digital lifestyle and old-school style video games. It consists of 200 micro games, randomly selected from the pool in one mode, or grouped together into 10 episodes in a second mode, linked together by cut-scenes featuring the teenager DJON.

Each micro game lasts only a few seconds, similar to the WarioWare games. During this short time limit, the player has to work out what he is supposed to do aided by a short sentence that appears when the game starts. There are also a number of tutorials and training modes. After clearing a set number of micro games the player is presented with a longer &amp;quot;boss&amp;quot; micro game which is generally more challenging in order to clear the level. Some of the games have suggestive themes or crude content.

By going through the games, new ones are unlocked or presented with different modes, such as the removal of the time limit. Other features include a rating mode for the different characters, music jukebox, a list of unlocked video segments, and playlists to compile a list of favourite games or share it through the internet or memory sticks. The playlists come with 3 modes: Challenge (play through a selection), Survive (try to keep playing for a set amount of time) and Freeplay. There is an Ad Hoc multiplayer mode to compete against a friend for the best score. Playing well fills a gauge. When maxed out, it can be used to send a &amp;quot;disturber&amp;quot; that modifies the opponent's screen display.

Some of the micro games use concepts of popular games such as Battlezone and Breakout. Additional games can be downloaded from the developer's website and are imported via a memory stick.</resource>

    <resource id="9be6a1389a86b82384614283112be00cb60d00a9" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Ultimate Racing is the first game in the series of Hot Wheels licensees to appear on the PSP platform. Just like the other games, it is a straightforward racing game with a focus on arcade gameplay. The game offers three game modes:
Ultimate Challenge: win races to unlock new cars, tracks, challenges and performance upgrades.

Arcade Mode: quick play based on the unlocked content from the Ultimate Challenge mode.

Multiplayer Mode: quick races or checkpoint-based races for up to four players
In Ultimate Challenge, there are six main stages to choose from, with eleven tracks and twenty licensed cars in total. The game starts from a central warehouse where all unlocked cars are stored. These can be upgraded or customized in the garage. Next to the performance upgrades, players can tweak the colors of the body, glass, neon, wheels, and change the wheels and decals.

The Arcade Mode is further divided into different challenges: Quick Race, Survival Mode (complete a series of increasingly difficult races and avoid being kicked out), Collector (checkpoint-based races) and Time Trial.

Next to regular racing controls such as brakes and acceleration, players can also use NOS (boost) and Slow Motion (slow down time during difficult sections). The use is limited as it depletes a reserve. It can be refilled by passing by obstacles without hitting them or completing tricky jumps. Tracks, with themes such as Volcano, Jungle or Death Valley, are generally filled with obstacles, moving objects or animals. The focus is entirely on racing, there are no weapons or other offensive means and the cars can only be slowed down, unable to sustain damage.

There are three different camera settings and ghost cars are supported during time trials.</resource>

As with previous installments of the PC series IL-2 Sturmovik, it depicts combat aircraft from World War II, although with less focus on realistic simulation than other entries in the series.[2] The game has a campaign mode in which players are able to fly the Allies against the Axis, and also a multiplayer mode in which they are able to select either faction.[3] A demo of the game launched on the PSN and Xbox 360's Xbox Live on 29 July 2009.[4]

Birds of Prey is based around the large-scale aerial combat and ground military operations of World War II. Players can participate in some of the warâ€™s most famous battles, piloting fighters, attack aircraft and heavy bombers across a range of missions. There are six theatres of war to engage in: The Battle of Britain, Stalingrad, Berlin, Sicily, Korsun and the Battle of the Bulge, representing the main airborne battles of World War II in Europe.

Birds of Prey has a new damage effects engine. Players can see real-time damage to the aircraft such as holes in the wings and trail lines during dog fights. IL-2 Sturmovik: Birds of Prey features hundreds of aircraft taking part in air battles. The environmental engine also produces high-detail, realistic landscapes that allow players to easily see ground support actions.[5]

The game was developed by Gaijin Entertainment, who subsequently developed Birds of Steel, also exclusively for consoles. Birds of Steel shares many traits with Birds of Prey (including HUD, aircraft models, controls, and menu design) but differentiates itself by concentrating primarily on USâ€“Japanese aerial battles of the Pacific theater.</resource>

With a title like that, you know it'll be a tough ride but The Impossible Game takes &amp;quot;difficulty&amp;quot; to a whole new level. It's fast-paced and brutal, but with near-instant respawning, the experience is as smooth as it is deadly.
You play a humble orange square, racing against a serene blue background. The trick is that there are plenty of obstacles on this course: triangles are like deadly spikes, and squares can be jumped on top of but will kill you if you slam into them. Likewise, you can die if you fall through a hole in the floor. Your orange square will hurtle forward regardless of the danger, and your only control is simple tap to jump. Longer taps equal longer jumps, and you?ll need meticulous precision if you want to survive. The music syncs with your music, which is a very nifty effect that adds to the surreal quality of the whole thing.</resource>

Only one agent can infiltrate his secret base and undertake this Impossible Mission.

The goal of Impossible Mission is to acquire nine passwords and bring these to Atombender's Control Room in time to shut down the rockets. Unfortunately these passcodes (contained on punch cards) have been broken into four pieces each, and each piece hidden in computers, furniture, and waste bins throughout the base. On top of that Atombender has an entire army of robots patrolling the base. If a robot touches or shocks the agent then ten minutes are removed from the clock and the room is reset. The agent can jump over robots, but the only way to stop them is to expend a specific item on a room's computer terminal, and even that only disables them for a few seconds.</resource>

It's Christmas time in New York and Zombies have come to ruin the festivities.  As New York Cop Agent Stevens, you find out that not only are you immune to the zombie virus, but your blood is actually so powerful, it will make a zombie explode.

The main focus of the gameplay is shooting holes in the zombies until they are weak enough for you to fire a vial of your own blood into them, causing an explosion.  Weaken enough zombies, fire a blood vial into one, and watch the chain reaction as exploding zombies send your anti-zombie blood onto other zombies.

The game was one of the first online PSP games, and featured a mode where defeating an opponent would give them your virus, and force their avatar online to look like your avatar.  If they in turn defeated someone, your virus would be passed onto them as well.  At any time you could look at a world map to see where on earth your strain of virus had travelled.</resource>

There are two modes present in the game. The &amp;quot;Arcade Mode&amp;quot;, as its name suggests, is a direct port of the arcade game, where the player chooses a car from a list of Japan's most famous drift machines, and hits the streets challenging characters out of the manga. The objective here is to simply beat every one of the characters to become the number one driver. As players go along, they collect points, which can be used to upgrade the car.

The second mode, &amp;quot;Story Mode&amp;quot;, allows the player to control Takumi, the protagonist of the series. In this mode, there are a number of missions the player must complete. These missions are modelled after the events of the manga and anime series. Most of the missions involve racing characters from the manga, in the same order that Takumi raced them in the original work.</resource>

If you're new to the franchise, the game adapts the story to allow you to begin a new adventure with Jasmin, Alex and the gang. The Lost Tribes includes all of the features that have made Invizimals such a well-loved franchise in Europe, with Novarama's augmented reality technology enabling you to literally hunt down, capture, battle, customize and trade the magical monsters living in the world all around you. This time around there will be 150 Invizimals, with 70 brand new Invizimals and 80 of the community's favorite Invizimals from the previous titles for you to capture, train, and battle. Players can also engage in Tag Team Battle mode, where you can fight 2 vs 2 Invizimals, allowing for even more dynamic battles and tactical gameplay than ever before!</resource>

It was developed under license by Sidhe Interactive in Wellington, New Zealand for the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable. The game was first shown at the 2006 E3 behind closed doors.

The Nintendo DS version of the game was developed by Sensory Sweep Studios in Salt Lake City, Utah.

All of the Jackass cast (excluding Bam Margera) and crew provided their own voices and supply their likenesses for the game, according to Sidhe Interactive. Johnny Knoxville and other members of the Jackass team also provided stunt ideas to the developer based on unused stunts from the show.[1] A trailer was released in June 2007 on the game's official website, along with the cover art.</resource>

A young French girl from the village of Domremy trying to assist her father with his daily labors discovers a mysterious object: an armlet that binds magically on her wrist. Soon the village is being attacked and finding the first sword she can, she steps forth to encounter the enemy, some humanoid beasts. Taking strength from the armlet, hearing a mysterious voice and having for assistance her close friends, she manages to defeat them and embarks on a long quest to help her countrymen and vanquish the evil forces invading France.

Jeanne d'Arc is a turn-based strategy RPG game of the Japanese variety, that fuses medieval history with fantasy and the craziness of Japanese anime. This is a well known story retold through tactical battles one after another, while game dialog along with hand drawn cutscenes twist the story into different territories from the original. 

It is a story of teen friendship and dedication, remorseless war, evil magic, unavoidable death, heartache abandonment and purifying hope. Jeanne joins the army and along with 14 other companions with different skills and personalities march to face England's Henry VI's troops. With her are other armlet wielders, able to use them and transform into fearsome warriors able to strike down evil at its core. The game features a map to move through locations where the battles which push the story forward happen along with free stages that add nothing more than fun, strong items and difficult bosses.</resource>

For example, who ever thought to mix colour matching with time trial style rally racing? And then to decide it should graphically look like something involing alien pond snakes and cellular life? Makes no sense, right? We at PomPom pride ourselves in making as little sense as possible. Hence our decision to do all the above. The result is JellyPops.


It goes something like this: You control a strange snake creature, which resides in a strange pond in a strange world with some strange rules. The aim is to stay alive as long as possible. Staying alive drains your live force, so Snake needs to collect life force gems to keep it going. With time, life gems become more and more scarce, resulting in a desperate race to reach the next gem before its lights out.


Between Snake and the life force gems are a myriad of other beasties that require special attention. Coloured Jellies which boost your gems value when collected as part of a combo. Teethy fish things that try to blast you with plasma. Spikey rocks and walls. Bouncing spherical cells that can be controlled and used as battering rams. Each level with its own unique mechanics to understand and master.

Features :
Available on PSP minis
Endless survival gameplay
8 ponds to traverse
Fun, slippy slidey racing type gameplay
Bonus Spirit and Boost unlockables
Medals awarded for achievements
Custom music which dynamically chages with gameplay
Quick playtime. The perfect game for filling 5 minutes.</resource>

Every so often new rows of blocks will push up the current ones. Not clearing enough within a set time limit will force the blocks to the top of the screen, where the player will lose. Blocks can be cleared if at least four blocks of the same color are touching. The speed of new rows will increase as the game is played longer. The blocks which get cleared will result in the blocks above falling down. The game offers several different modes including a multiplayer and arcade mode. Games in the franchise have been released for the arcade, PSP, and mobile phone (EZweb, Yahoo! Keitai (Yahoo!ã‚±ãƒ¼ã‚¿ã‚¤)). A second PSP Kollon game, titled Korokoro Kollon (ã‚³ãƒ­ã‚³ãƒ­ã“ã‚ã‚“) was released in Japan on June 22, 2006.</resource>

    <resource id="27e2bda1d100aa54e0b7dddcece9cd5fde8d4158" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Lego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy is a multi-platform action-adventure video game developed by Traveller's Tales and published by LucasArts and TT Games. It was released on September 11, 2006. Part of the Lego Star Wars series, it is based on the Star Wars science fiction media franchise and Lego Group's Star Wars-themed toy line. It follows the events of the Star Wars films Star Wars, The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. The game allows players to assume the roles of over 50 Lego versions of characters from the film series; customized characters can also be created. Camera movement was improved from its predecessorâ€”Lego Star Wars: The Video Game; and the concept of &amp;quot;vehicle levels&amp;quot; was explored more thoroughly. The game was revealed at American International Toy Fair 2006. Promotions for the game were set up at chain stores across the United States.

Lego Star Wars II was critically and commercially successful; it has sold over 8.2 million copies worldwide as of May 2009. Critics praised the game for its comedic and &amp;quot;adorable&amp;quot;[2][3] portrayal of the film series and for their preference of the original trilogy to the prequel trilogy. However, the game's low difficulty, and its Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS versions in general, were received more poorly. The game received awards from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts and Spike TV, among others. A mobile phone adaptation was later developed by Universomo, published by THQ, and released on December 19, 2006. Lego Star Wars and Lego Star Wars II were compiled in Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga, released on November 6, 2007. The OS X version of the game was released in April 2007 by Feral Interactive.[4]</resource>

It has the same basic storyline, though some cutscenes and much of the dialogue within have been expanded or modified in other ways. Locations correspond to those of the original version and are accessed in the same order, but have been re-designed with different layouts and mostly completely different puzzles which allow implementation of new moves introduced in Lara Croft Tomb Raider: Legend: swinging on ropes and using a grappling hook at specific points.

Puzzles are generally more focused on acrobatics in this version, ledges being much more prominently featured as a level design element, requiring combinations of jumping and shimmying across them to access areas. This type of gameplay replaces the key-retrieval and block-pushing puzzles of the original almost entirely. Combat is similar to that of the first game, though the player must now manually activate targeting. Some boss fights have been made a separate enclosed stage rather than being part of the exploration as in the original version. These fights may have puzzle-solving elements and often require the player to use Lara's new &amp;quot;adrenaline dodge&amp;quot; ability, which slightly slows down time when the opponent charges at her while in an &amp;quot;enraged&amp;quot; state. Some cutscenes require the player to participate in quick-time events.</resource>

Pen and paper is no longer required as the game comes pre-loaded with 1000 Sudoku puzzles, with the option to download additional puzzles from the game's website.

The actual game of Sudoku is fairly simple, and has nothing to do with mathematics at all - instead, it's all to do with logic. The numbers one to nine must fit horizontally and vertically in the 9x9 Sudoku grid - the catch is that the numbers one to nine must also appear in each of the nine smaller 3x3 grids.

The game features a short tutorial that shows you how to play, as well as a Training option which lets you play five easy puzzles with help. Multiplayer mode is also supported either by taking turns with one system (either co-operatively or competitively), or by playing wirelessly with up to four PSPs.</resource>

The game features four fictitious golf courses in Fiji, England, USA and Scotland. The goal is of course to get the ball into the hole with the flag in as less strikes as possible. To make it harder for the players to meet that goal, the courses are littered with obstacles like hills and sand bunkers. In addition the wind decides too where the player's ball lands.

As opposed to real life though, the player can influence the ball's flightpath during the flight by choosing in which direction it spins. This allows to compensate for wind and also for a bad angle at the strike. How hard the player hits the ball is decided by a gauge where the player needs to click at the right moment. The same goes for the angle. Although the game hands the player a club that it thinks fits the situation, he can also choose his own.</resource>

The included games are based on some of the scenes and recurring characters. It also includes the original voices of the two leads and the narrator. Players need to unlock the different games by competing in a Tour with three difficulty levels. On Easy, for each 50,000 points another game is opened up and clips from the series are unlocked. The included games are set at different, fictitious locations in Britain and require a lot of button mashing:
Darkley Noone: Vicky Pollars needs to complete two laps on roller-skates in a skate park. She has to collect CDs to throw a party, while avoiding hazard, performing tricks when jumping in the air, and grinding on rails.

Herby: Lou and Andy go to the swimming pool, but as soon as they are there, Andy doesn't like it. While Lou explains to a guard how he wants his handicapped friend get to swim, Andy need to dive off diving boards and perform tricks. There are three boards to choose from and he needs to get back in his wheelchair before time runs out.

Sessex: Weight Watcher guide Marjorie runs around in a supermarket collecting cookies in a Pac-Man-style mini-game. The ghosts are represented by fatties she needs to avoid, but by picking up cake (similar to the original power pellets), she can take them out for a short time.

Slut: Letty has to squash all the frogs in her living room, making sure not to hit any other objects. Gameplay is similar to the Whac-A-Mole concept, except that the frogs jump around instead of popping up.

Old Haven: Emily, a real lady, needs to score a number of goals in a game of football (soccer) before time runs out. She needs to progress over the pitch step by step and avoid hitting the defenders as that returns her to the starting location. She does get points for shooting them in their private parts. The PSP version is slightly different as it is presented as a game of penalty kicks, without defenders. The direction and the force of the kick can be determined separately.

Pox: make matches of three identical items collecting food in Maggie's gullet as she gulps it down. Once it is full, she can spew out all the food over her friends at the party for extra points.

Llandewi Breffi: Dafydd Thomas is the only gay in the village and needs to prove it. He rides a bicycle through the streets and needs to collect copies of Gay Magazine while running down other people and slapping fake gays.
The PSP version contains an additional game:
Flatley: help &amp;quot;Eh Eh Eh&amp;quot; Anne at the psychiatric institute to destroy the flowers in the garden. She can stamp them, pull them out, and then smash it or chuck it. She needs to avoid the men in white coats that chase after her. She can temporarily stun them by flashing them when she lifts her skirt.</resource>

It was published on all platforms by WB Games.

The game is an adaptation of Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings film trilogy; The Fellowship of the Ring (2001), The Two Towers (2002) and The Return of the King (2003). Set fifteen years after the War of the Ring, the game features Samwise Gamgee telling his children of the adventures of Aragorn during the conflict; his stories form the majority of the game's content. Aragorn's Quest was the first Lord of the Rings game released by WB Games, who had acquired the rights to make games based on the New Line Cinema film series from Electronic Arts in 2009.

The game was aimed primarily at younger players, offering a simplified and less violent version of the plots of the three films. It received mixed to negative reviews, with critics finding the combat repetitive, the narrative too truncated and the overall game too easy.</resource>

Players experience the entire trilogy, from the earliest battle at Weathertop to the final conclusion at Minas Tirith and Mordor.

Unlike other tactics games, which are strictly straightforward turn-based affairs, The Lord of the Rings: Tactics innovates in its system. Players assign their moves simultaneously with the AI, and then all the actions unfold. In this way, players must guess their opponent's intentions and try to block them before they actually happen. This keeps the action moving much faster than a traditional tactics game.</resource>

    <resource id="9822e3ce53acd7de70ebc18f166185077b3ca16f" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">The sequel to the Lumines stays close the original puzzle game, but add some twists. The gameplay is identical: you arrange blocks, made of four smaller block pieces with two colours in total, to form shapes with an identical colour, as a square of four pieces or more. The blocks can be rotated and are stacked with the other blocks on the board. A vertical line crosses the screen and when it hits the right side, all combinations are removed, causing chain combos and clearing the board. You have to prevent the blocks from piling up and reaching the top of the screen. There are also special blocks you can use to remove many blocks at once. Games are played against colorful backgrounds and the speed of the timeline matches the music of the level, while the falling speed of the blocks increases as you get further in the game.

The game modes are either new or have been remixed. In the single-player Challenge mode, there are three difficulty classes. By clearing levels you unlock new music, skins and game modes. One of these are the Endurance challenge runs, where you have to play through all skins in the game. Next to games with regular skins, some backgrounds now have 3D animations or show music videos of popular artists. The sound effects and the design of blocks is often adapted to fit the music. For levels with music video skins, you cannot play through them at a quicker pace to clear the level as you have to keep going until the song ends.

The other single-player modes are Time Attack mode (get a high score with limited time, you can even record your session) and Puzzle mode where you need to create shapes. You can also challenge the computer in the VS CPU Mode. Here, you need to score more than your opponent to make his playing field smaller until he gets stuck. This game type is also available as the Duel mode against a human player through Wi-Fi. The order of the skins can be defined in the new Skin Edit mode. The Single Lap section allows you to make your own playlists for a set run, while the Endless Lap allows you to choose or exclude skins to keep playing as long as you like. There are 60 levels and 100 skins in total.

Another new feature is the Mission mode where more strategy is required. You are given specific tasks to clear boards with a limited amount of blocks or time. In the new Sequencer mode, you can compose your own songs. The game provides options to define the speed and 8 separate music sheets to place notes and effects on. The high scores, playlists from the Skin Edit mode, songs from the Sequencer mode and replays of the Time Attack mode can be exchanged with other players through Wi-Fi. Your performance is tracked in the Database mode where statistics of your playing sessions are available. The game also includes a demo of Every Extend Extra, another puzzle game by Q ENTERTAINMENT, Inc.</resource>

With Althena gone and no one able or willing to become the next Dragonmaster, a shadowy figure, known only as the Magic Emperor, has started plotting to usurp Althena's place and become a god. In a remote village far removed from the decay that is slowly spreading throughout the world lives a young man named Alex, who dreams of one day becoming the next Dragonmaster like his hero Dyne. One day, Alex's friend Ramus convinces him to head towards a cave near town, where it is rumored the legendary White Dragon resides. With Alex's adopted sister Luna and his mysterious pet Nall in tow, Alex heads off on what seems to be a meaningless adventure, not knowing that it would be the first step in an epic journey with the fate of the entire world at stake.</resource>

    <resource id="420632c979a82a9887ce04ad899bad7624b3e64b" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">One of the first Sony MLB licensed games to be on the PSP, it features all the major league teams at the time as well as the top players for its day with brand new animations designed for the PSP. The game can be considered a slimmed down version of MLB 2006. It has the standard game modes, Quick Game, Season Mode as well as a Multiplayer mode where two players can compete against each other using the Ad Hoc.

Some of the new gameplay mechanics for the game areRelease Point Pitching with Confidence meter which would determine the success rate of the pitcher depending on the stats and skill of the player. The more successful pitches made within a certain zone, the easier the pitches become, missing them cause wild pitches or pitch a line drive right to the batter.

Another is the Playmaker Fielding Marker, where unlike other games this one used the players stats to determine if regular plays like pop-ups would be considered easy by giving the player ample opportunity by showing the landing location faster and giving it a more wider area.  Less skilled players would be given less of a warning and a smaller catching radius, making even the simplest plays more challenging.

The Branch Point Technology introduced a seamless flow of transition for the game that allowed the player to plan out the direction of a throw while still in the process of catching it and was also used for baserunning that gave it a smoother feel to running and sliding.</resource>

Although the game is named after Macross Frontier, all current Macross series (with the exception of Macross II: Lovers Again) are included. Players create two pilots (a main pilot and a wingman) and fight in the many memorable battles of the Macross timeline.
The developers, Artdink, are also known for the Gundam Battle PSP series. Macross Ace Frontier uses a slightly modified version of the Gundam Battle engine, and therefore has many notable similarities to Gundam Battle Universe.</resource>

The 07 game focuses on the Running Back by giving you lead blocker controls. After selecting a running play, you can cycle through offensive players to open up gaps. New evasive maneuvers are controlled with a separate stick to elude defenders, along with new juking and spinning maneuvers.

Start a career with your favorite NFL team, draft the players, call the plays, and lead your team to a dynasty. Or, make your own player and guide him on and off the field through his entire career starting with the draft. If you do not want to mess with all the options and features you can simply sit down for a quick game.</resource>

To complete the game Elta must reach the final stage and defeat the main antagonist Az Atorse himself.
The gameplay is typical to a standard action-platformer fitted for arcade machines and thus very challenging. If the player takes too long to complete a stage, Elta will be harassed by an invincible monster. Like many earlier SNK games, it is well known for its challenging difficulty.
Aside from the fantasy themes there's an added twist of transformations that make the wizard more powerful and grants him new attacks. When he has not been transformed, Elta's primary form of attack is a weak but fast-moving energy projectile that he can shoot in four directions; left, right, up and (while in midair) down.</resource>

However, this means that the remains of the Book of Darkness  soon return and Nanoha and her friends are forced to fight them. These remnants take form of twisted, dark copies of real people called &amp;quot;dark fragments&amp;quot;. In addition to Nanoha, Fate, and Hayate's own dark copies, they soon have to face the three much more powerful and dangerous clones of themselves known as &amp;quot;Material&amp;quot;, as well. Every playable character must face and defeat the clones of their own friends to advance their storylines. 

All of the playable characters except the Materials have their own different story route in the game. Every route has the same basic structure: the player must first pass a training session, then defeat the dark clones of two of their best friends, defeat one Material boss, defeat the clones of two more freinds, then lastly defeat a Material boss version of themselves.</resource>

    <resource id="d521a021c8d85b5ee49a4313f1d86a7d2bf42edd" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Major League Baseball 2K9 is a simulation of the sport of baseball. The heart of the game is the franchise mode where the player can play whole seasons with its hundreds of matches and a managerial part. Besides keeping the balance, there are three main activities in this part: studying extensive statistics, player trading and hiring players through free agents. The latter is similar to other sports games: every player has other wishes for his team, e.g. athletic success. If the player's club can fulfill these wishes better the club has to pay less salary. Trading however is handled differently: Every club gives a value to the players on the roster. This value influences how the trading plays out. Training is another important part to consider.

Matches can either be simulated or played manually. Every part of the match has its own control scheme: For pitching the player uses two parts of his input device: the first for aiming and the second to recreate a movement (depending on the used move). Batting is done by swinging the bat in the right timing. He can also influence the ball's direction in the way he hits it. During fielding the player basically tells the controlled player the direction in which he should throw the ball. 
Besides the franchise mode the player can participate in training, Home Run Derby and Postseason mode (play-offs). Players can unlock training cards.

The are a few small differences between the versions: on the Wii the player controls batting and pitching directly with the remote and the nunchuck and the PSP version features slightly different fielding controls. In the franchise mode the player can manage up to four franchises in the PS2 version and there is a farming system on PSP.</resource>

Battle gameplay takes place on a map divided into a square grid. The player controls a squad of humanoid units and monsters, which each occupy a single square of the grid and do combat with a group of enemies. Depending on the character and attack selected, the player will be able to deal damage to a specific enemy unit or a designated region of the map. Combat ends when all enemy units or all of the player's units are destroyed.
Humanoid characters may lift and throw other units across the map in order to allow allies to move further or force enemies to keep their distance. This even allows the player to capture enemies by throwing them into the base panel; these enemies then become allies, and can be used on subsequent maps. The chance of capturing an enemy in this manner depends on several factors. Failure to capture the enemy will result in the death of all characters inside the base panel, and the enemy will survive.</resource>

    <resource id="f3d83d65e5b12f2abd1577d2be241006f7a230a7" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Manhunt 2 does not build upon the story and events of the first game. Instead, the same game mechanics are transferred to a new location, the Dixmor Insane Asylum, where the staff prefers to beat up the patients and experiment on them, rather than to offer treatment for their illness. One day a power outage allows the patients to revolt and bring mayhem to the asylum. The player gets the chance to play two roles: as Dr. Daniel Lamb and Leo Kasper. Although the beginning is set inside the asylum, the action soon moves to other locations.

The game mechanics are largely stealth oriented, while later levels offer more of a regular third-person shooter feel when more firearms become available. Gunplay requires extensive use of cover, maneuvers and sometimes stealth for success. There is a radar system, enemies have different levels of awareness and kills are best performed from the shadows. Players can throw objects to distract enemies or make noises into the USB headset to lure them away from their friends (PS2). To hide in the dark a quick mini-game needs to be performed. If it is not completed in time, the character's location will be revealed at once.

As in the first game players can perform executions, with three styles: Hasty (white), Violent (yellow) and Gruesome (red). These feature explicit violence including strangling, beatings, gun violence, setting them on fire and more. Some of these kills are however censored with blacked out scenes or the camera turning away. In the Wii version player need to mimic the motions needed for a kill with the combination of the Wiimote and the Nunchuk.

All versions are quite similar. The Wii edition includes three exclusive weapons (bottle, mace and a razor), while the other two versions have a weapon not found in the Wii game: a samurai sword. The Wii version is also the only one to include a short tutorial to familiarize the player with the controls. Other small changes in the Wii edition include more detailed environments, additional dialogue, new hunters (Sexual Deviants scene), some changes in weapon placement, a new manhole execution (in Ghosts), and more animations for Daniel and Leo, especially in close combat.</resource>

Now for the first time ever, over 20 Marvel superheroes including Spider-Man, Captain America, Wolverine, Ghost Rider, Blade and Silver Surfer have come together to stop Doom. Mix and match your choice of Marvel superheroes, in teams of four as you travel across the Marvel Universe to stop this threat. Certain teams such as The Fantastic Four and The New Avengers provide additional bonuses.

Some heroes must be unlocked first. The game also features RPG elements, such as leveling up. When a hero gains a level, they earn points you can use to upgrade their skills. You also collect Shield Coins, which can be spent on boosts for your hero team. 

You explore various legendary Marvel locales, from Asgard, to Prince Namor's Atlantis, where you take on foes with punches, kicks and super powers. Super powers drain energy, however, so use them wisely. Combos can be achieved by combining super powers. Energy is restored by collecting blue orbs from fallen foes. 

Boss battles are like the comics themselves: titanic battles that often not only test brawn but your brain as well. With over 20 playable heroes plus all the cameos, there are over 100 heroes and villains.

The game modes feature either single player, co-op, or online play. In general, Marvel Ultimate Alliance's gameplay can be considered an improved version of 2004's X-Men: Legends. The different versions are fairly identical. The PSP release has three more game modes, while Wii, PS3 and Xbox 360 have additional levels.</resource>

    <resource id="1317727618c866206f05ae2997e8476a8641e55a" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2 continues the four-player mayhem of the previous Marvel Ultimate Alliance and, before that, the X-Men Legends series It is based on the Secret War and Civil War storylines from the comics. After Nick Fury leads an unauthorized super-hero assault on Latveria and a fight gone wrong kills hundreds of civilians in Connecticut, the government passes the super-human registration act, which requires all super-powered individuals to reveal their identities to the government. At one point in the story, you have to choose the pro or anti registration side and certain heroes will always be on one side or another, locking them out if you choose the other path. The game after this point changes depending on the storyline you choose.

You start with a handful of characters and can unlock more by completing bonus simulator missions, which will give you a special task like blowing up cars. There are four heroes active at all times during the game, unless they get knocked out. Each character has a health meter and a stamina meter. You can use SHIELD access points, usually at the beginning and middle of each level, to switch out characters. The stamina meter recharges on its own and controls use of powers. Each hero has a jump (which can also be used to double-jump, fly or web-swing, depending on the character), grab, quick strike and powerful strike. These can be used in combination to do things like jumping attacks, pick up an enemy, then punch them, etc. Combining these with a modifier button allows you to use powers. Each hero has a wide variety of powers. Leveling up gives you points to spend on improving the powers. You can re-assign the points and change which powers are active at any time.

Defeating enemies and smashing environment items gives you health refills and points that can be spent upgrading statistics for each hero. There are also items that you can carry that will give stat bonuses like increased HP or a bonus to a specific type of damage.

The big change over the previous game is the addition of fusions, which are two-character team-up attacks. This is controlled by a meter of four stars. You fill this by defeating enemies or finding an item that instantly fills the whole meter. You can spend one star to revive a fallen teammate or all four to perform a fusion attack. Any possible combination of two characters has their own unique fusion. There are three basic types:

There are targeted fusions, like having Things throw Mr. Fantastic at someone. These do high damage to a single target and are good for using on bosses. There are also clearing fusions, like having Storm bounce her lighting off Wolverine. These damage all enemies in a given radius. Clearing fusions are good for clearing out a clump of enemies. Finally, there are guided fusions, like Iceman and Human Torch shooting their powers at each other, then running around mowing down anyone who gets between them. These are good for clearing out scattered enemies.</resource>

With a story line like that the stage is set for lots of fighting, though the enemies can be targeted so players can throw objects and use long range attacks. Player(s) can either work their way through the story in Adventure Mode, or fight with other players in Battle Mode.</resource>

System collectible card game rules by Upper Deck. It includes cards from all of the Marvel-based Vs. sets through the X-Men set.

The gameplay involves head-to-head battles where players recruit superhero characters with various strengths and powers onto the playfield. Each character has a basic Attack and Defense value which determines the outcome of individual character battles. This basic mechanic is augmented by character powers, Equipment cards (which give the character additional powers/stats), Location cards (which affect multiple cards or game rules while they are face up), and Plot Twist cards (which are often played to change the outcome of individual character battles by boosting Attack or Defense values).

The game features two single player campaigns, tutorials, puzzles, and an online mode similar to Magic The Gathering Online. The online mode supports cross-platform play between the PC and PSP versions.</resource>

The Wii version was announced at Nintendo's E3 2007 Press Conference on July 11, 2007. It may not be sold to people under 18 in Germany because of its USK rating.[2] Medal of Honor: Heroes 2 is set in World War II, starting on the Normandy beaches trying to control German bunkers and then move on to secure a village somewhere in France.

This is the second Medal of Honor game to be released for the Wii. The first was Medal of Honor: Vanguard.

To date, it is the last World War II era Medal of Honor game released.</resource>

Dr. Cain's discovery of X led to the creation of reploids, robots modeled after the design of X. When the maverick virus infects a group of reploids, they band together in a revolt against humanity. The call goes to the maverick hunters, X and Zero, to fight the Mavericks.

The game is a side-scrolling action game where the player controls X as he hunts the maverick reploids. Notable features include the ability to find enhancements to augment X's abilities, and the ability to absorb the powers of the maverick reploids X defeats. The original moves, such as dashes, wall jumps and charge shorts are still present.

The original flat backgrounds have been replaced by polygonal models, and the remake features enhanced explosions and generally more detail. Additionally, animated cutscenes and voice acting have been added. All weapon and armour upgrades have been relocated to new hidden areas, and there is a new mode: Vile, in which you can play the entire game as maverick Vile, with abilities Mega Man does not have. As a bonus, there is a demo of Mega Man Powered Up on the UMD - a remake of the very first Mega Man game.</resource>

One of these robots is named &amp;quot;Mega&amp;quot; and is designed to help Light around the lab in various tasks. One day, evil Dr. Wily attacks the lab and turn all of the robots evil too. All except Mega. Dr. Light sends Mega to stop these robots and thus, Mega Man is born.

Mega Man: Powered Up is a semi-remake of the original Mega Man.
There is an &amp;quot;Old Mode&amp;quot;, where one tackles the adventure just like it was in the olden days, with the exception of an added feature to save game. The graphics are souped up, but the level layout is basically the same than in the original with a few minor changes here and there.
Then there's the &amp;quot;New Mode&amp;quot; which also features the original level themes and bosses but the levels themselves are boosted with various hidden areas and features which are mostly impossible to get to with Megaman only. The Player must defeat the bosses after which they'll be available as playable characters and use their special abilities to find everything in every level.

The third mode is the Challenge Mode where there is 100 different challenges to tackle and in which one has to dispatch as many enemies as possible in a given amount of time, get to the specific goal in a given amount of time and so on.

In addition to these two main game modes, there is a level editor that can be used to build the Megaman level of one's dreams and play it or send it to the internet where other gamers can download and play it.</resource>

    <resource id="3e1eaeb6db3d013c79ee8392827f556fe40b7cd1" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Mercury Meltdown is the sequel to Archer Maclean's Mercury, a puzzle game where your job is to guide a blob of mercury, or several blobs, along various mazes, by tilting the game world, while hazard try to zap, attract, repulse, eat, or blow you up.

Mercury Meltdown features a new vibrant visual style, a lot of completely new stages, a free-look camera, ghost mercuries and replays for your best times that can be saved, and much more. The game's original realistic graphics have been turned into a more cartoon style. The mercury now has a black line around the outside of it.

The main change in the game is the ability to change the mercury into 3 more states. Besides normal state now you can turn the mercury into the &amp;quot;Fast&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Slow&amp;quot; using a heater and a cooler, and using a solidifier you can make it unto &amp;quot;Solid&amp;quot; state, a round, non-breakable ball. The mercury can still be split using a splitter, needed to solve certain puzzles.

Unlike the original Mercury, the game is split into themed &amp;quot;Labs&amp;quot;  rather than “Worlds”. There are 10 Labs, with 16 initial stages: Astro, Bio, Chemical, Electro, Geo, Atom, Aero, Hydro, Micro, V.R. (Virtual Reality). The PS2 version adds two more: Chrono and Cryo, as well as twin analog control, support for the rumble feature, improved graphics and all the levels from the original Archer Maclean's Mercury. There are 168 stages in the PSP version and over 200 in the PS2 game. Unlike the previous game, there is no strict order to play the levels. Once a Lab has been unlocked, you can play all the stages included right away.

Attributes show how well you do in the games. The best performance is awarded with a golden cork, based on four conditions: a high score (a 1 sticker), all bonus items found (a star sticker), 100% mercury (a corked test-tube), and complete the level within the time limit. While playing, your progress is measured in faces that replace the time clock. The time limit cannot cause the game to end anymore, instead it just turns into a sad face and players can still complete the level. The mercury limits have also been removed, but 100% mercury is still needed to access some of the later stages.

The top right corner shows a color chart, to help with mixing colors in the game. This can also be done in the paintshop. This release adds multi-paintshops, triangle base pyramid shaped constructions with 3 different coloured gates on either side.

In addition to the main game, there are now five party games, which are unlocked by collecting the bonus stars in the main game:

1. Metrix: puzzle games where coloured blocks need to be fit inside a pre-defined grid.

2. Paint: move the mercury to paint the tray as much as possible against your opponent.

3. Race: guide mercury around speedy track with boost pads and avoid falling off.

4. Rodeo: tilt the playing area to keep the mercury on the field, while a fan tries to knock you off.

2. Shove: aim the mercury for the center spot of the target, just like curling.

All the party games can be played in multiplayer over Wi-Fi on the PSP. The tutorial is now separate from the main game, and there is an additional Playground mode where you can test the different items in the game.</resource>

Metal Slug XX includes various single-player features in the form of a Combat School that lets players return to previously completed missions while executing various objectives; a POW List that shows how many POWs were rescued in each level; and single-player Rankings. Players can also cooperate in Ad-Hoc while gunning down hordes of humorous foes using familiar weapons in seven distinct levels that will see our heroes traverse deserts, mountains, caves and lava pits to finally put an end to their longtime enemy.

This revised version includes additional content including co-op multiplayer and downloadable content, as well as the character Leona Heidern.</resource>

It was released as a tie-in with the movie of the same name. Therefore, the likeness of the narcotics officers Crockett and Tubbs are based on that of Colin Farrell and Jamie Foxx, respectively.

While going through levels, the majority of the gameplay is combat, with enemies who must be killed to advance the level. Emphasis is put on taking cover, with health running out quite fast if player remains in the open during a shoot-out. All fire-arms have laser sightings, which acts as an aiming reticule.

The player may also deal drugs amongst other suppliers, both buying and selling. Drugs can be bought at one point and kept for several days, in which they may increase in value, thus making a profit for the player. Additionally, varying drugs can be obtained throughout each of the levels, and sold for a profit once the level is complete. Drugs can also be sold to informants for information.</resource>

Players make their character dance by tapping the PSP directional buttons in time with the music, following on-screen cues. Routines are modeled after the artist's choreography, as seen in famous music videos and live performances, using a rotoscope-style animation technique to reproduce the actual poses and postures. As players master the routine for each song, it becomes unlocked in a jukebox mode that can be accessed at any time. The game has three difficulty settings, to challenge fans of all skill levels.</resource>

While a good deal of the game mirrors the Playstation 2 original, there have been a large number of additions. There are now more quests, more monsters, more weapons, more armor and more areas around town to use to your advantage.

You now have a farm that sits just outside of town. You'll have access to some mining veins, bug catching spots, a dock for catching fish and a garden. This means that now you can gather materials when you're between missions, which doesn't eliminate the need to gather things while on the hunt, but it does make it less of a hassle. Another extra area is the training school. Here you can partake in hunts with specific limitations; you have a specified item and equipment layout, and have to take on larger prey within a shorter time limit. It's tough to be sure, but it also opens up the ability to produce some very special and powerful new weapons.

There are some insanely difficult hunts you can take later in the game. As for the new creatures, they run the gamut from having added colors (with new armor options to match) to totally new monsters (like a battle-worn wyvern with a huge mean streak). As an added bonus, not only can you make new types of armor from these new critters, but you can (in some cases) make more armor from classic monsters.

The controls on the PSP are a little different. While the PSP does lack two shoulder buttons and a second analog stick, players just press two face buttons instead of swinging the right analog stick. Triangle, Circle, and Triangle and Circle combined unleash three different types of attacks, while holding the right shoulder button blocks (or charges to attack if you're using a hammer). Multiplayer is limited to Ad-Hoc, so no going online to form a hunting party.</resource>

    <resource id="8242afd03846f8df295cd1baaa211d71b0a74fb2" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Monster Hunter Freedom 2 is the sequel to Monster Hunter Freedom, based on the PlayStation 2 predecessor Monster Hunter 2, which was never released outside Japan. This game is not a direct port from PlayStation 2 release. New features have been added while others were removed to make the game appropriate for its new portable form. For example, there are item boxes used as global deposits allowing to store items and access them any time without entering &amp;quot;home&amp;quot;.

The game features most elements from its predecessor, and you still need to fulfil missions - hunt monsters, gather materials and use them to create better equipment. Unlike the original game in Monster Hunter Freedom 2 all missions can be finished solo. The game world has also been expanded and now includes more unique territories for players to explore.

Multiplayer is still limited to Ad-Hoc, but the game features online downloadable quests which often provide special materials that can create bonus equipment impossible to create otherwise.</resource>

The monster will try to flee up the screen and you will have to catch him using your double-jump ability. Hit the monster three times while double-jumping and it is defeated. Landing on platforms builds up your combo resulting in more advanced finishing moves when you reach the monster for the third time. Also, high combo score is crucial for progressing in the game as it will unlock trophies, scrapbook entries and a hidden level.</resource>

It features all the riders from that 2005 season, but only eight of the seventeen circuits. There are two main modes of play, arcade and season. Arcade allows the player to select any rider and track to race on. Season mode allows the player to take part in a complete season with one 'real-life' rider, or alternatively to compete over multiple seasons with a fictional rider, with the ability to move teams at the end of the season depending on the performance during the season. Different levels of difficulty relating to the realism of the bikes handling and performance are offered to cater for both novice and more experienced players. All the usual setup options are available to tune the bikes for each track.</resource>

    <resource id="c69ee325f04e318002aa1d59d9fe28bbe1bc153d" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">You have just stumbled upon a most intriguing book, a book titled Myst. You have no idea where it came from, who wrote it, or how old it is. Reading through its pages provides you with only a superbly crafted description of an island world. But it's just a book, isn't it? As you reach the end of the book, you lay your hand on a page. Suddenly your own world dissolves into blackness, replaced with the island world the pages described. Now you're here, wherever here is, with no option but to explore.

Myst is a first-person point-and-click adventure where the player controls a character known as The Stranger. Magically transported into the world described in the book, he needs to explore Myst Island and solve its mysteries. The game is presented as a series of static scenes where the player acts with the environment by clicking and manipulating objects. There are no enemies and it is not possible to die. Through Myst Island, the game is further divided into mini-worlds set in different ages accessed through different books.

The PSP version adds new adventure scenarios and includes widescreen support.

The DS version includes a completely new age, the Rime Age, and, next to a code rewrite, includes new and re-mastered sound effects and video clips.</resource>

When he goes missing, Nicole must find the scattered pieces of the key around the world.

The Mystery of the Crystal Portal is a hidden object that replaces the traditional list of objects names with a different gameplay mechanic. The player has to click on certain objects in the scenery that open a circle around it with photographs of items that must be found and dragged to it. After picking all the required stuff, some of these container objects disappear to reveal a key item underneath them.

Some of the objects have to be collected in one screen to be used in another place (for example, finding matches outside the house to light a fireplace inside). At the end of each stage/location there's a unique logic puzzle game to be solved, involving some of the objects that the player picked up.</resource>

While initially released as Fantasy Chronicles for the iOS, the name was retitled as a result of Natsume providing a new English translation for its release on the PlayStation Portable, released in North America on July 16, 2013.

The game plays as a traditional Japanese role-playing video game. In the game, the player navigates a character through a fantasy would, interacing with non-playable characters and fighting enemies. When engaging enemies, the game utilizes a turn based battle system reminiscent of ones found in the Dragon Quest series of games.</resource>

Players control a small, but very agile ninja through different small areas. Next to movement, only a single button is used to jump, but this allows the ninja to run up walls, do wall jumps and cross large distances.

Levels are divided over different episodes unlocked gradually. Each level consists of a single screen with a time limit. The amount of time can be replenished by collecting golden coins, but the main goals is to activate the exit, usually by touching a specific button or opening a number of doors. Areas are filled with hazards such as spikes and droids that shoot laser or rockets. There are also obstacles such as platforms that only move in a single direction or falling damage from high platforms. Death is always instant, but the player is given an unlimited amount of tries.

The PSP version includes a mix of original levels and user-created ones with about 200 in total. There is also a level editor and unlike the Xbox 360 version these can be shared with other players. The PSP version shows the levels from a &amp;quot;medium&amp;quot; distance, while the DS version contains a far view and a close view on the screens. Physics are also slightly different in each version.

There are both competitive and cooperative game modes available in multiplayer sessions. Players can switch between the pure mode with original graphics and the plus mode with enhanced visuals. The unlockables includes victory screens, new music and new colours for the ninja.</resource>

While it does include classic features such as exhibition, season, franchise, and multiplayer modes, the life mode is a take similar to the MLB: The Show. 

The life mode has the player take control of an NBA rookie right out of college and just being drafted. As in the MLB Show series, the player may only control one character and cannot control others on their team or make any management decisions. The player's role of the team will be determined by their performance on and off the court. The better the player is at playing basketball and being a teammate, the more likelier they will be a huge part of the team and receive better contracts and endorsement deals.</resource>

This time around the player can take control of a created superstar (five total) with the ability to interact with three different characters and constantly change the storyline. 

The Team Progression System makes a return, rewarding the player for game exploration and completing certain achievements given to them throughout the game. Completing these tasks can unlock certain accessories that they can use for their created character, showing off their status. Players can also associate with various teammates and coaches, how they act towards these characters will determine their place with the team (being a team player and helping out others will have the coaches play you more and have create a bigger fan base and being a individual loner will alienate them from the team and have a smaller fan base).

The obligatory game modes also exist in this version as well (Franchise, Exhibition) as well as updated NBA rosters with every NBA team available. The Havok engine is introduced for this version, giving the game a more realistic feel when combined with new animations and enhanced character models.

NBA Replay also returns, letting players relive classic moments from the 07/08 as well as partake in the 08/09 season by downloading them off of the Playstation Network (five each week during the season). Players can also upload and share data, show off their created superstars and track their progress through leaderboards and even play against each other in online exhibition games.

Audio commentary is provided by Seattle Supersonics star Kevin Calabro and franchise newcomer Kenny &amp;quot;The Jet&amp;quot; Smith.</resource>

We meet Nayuta's childhood friend Lyra.
A large tower-shaped ruin falls near the island. Ruins fall from time to time near Remnant Island but this one is much larger than usual. Aulbath gives Nayuta and Signa permission to investigate.
At the top of the tower, Nayuta and Signa find a fairy. Immediately, Zext, a large man with the air of a villain, appears with Serum, his servant. Zext takes the gear the fairy is holding, called a Master Gear, by force. Afterward, Signa and Serum exchange blows, but Signa is easily defeated. Zext and Serum then leave. Nayuta and Signa decide to take the fairy back to Nayuta's house secretly for treatment.
Back at Nayuta's house, the fairy awakes. Nayuta and Signa introduce themselves and learn the fairy's name is Noi. They learn that Zext is evil and the Master Gear is important for stopping him somehow. At this point, Noi leaves Nayuta's house and activates a dormant portal nearby.

On May 21, 2007, Electronic Arts published a teaser trailer of ProStreet, and officially announced it ten days later.[3] It was released worldwide in November 2007.[1] ProStreet includes more than 40 cars including a few from American Le Mans Series. ProStreet was the first PlayStation 3 game with DualShock 3 rumble support.

The demo, featuring two races, one speed challenge and one grip race, appeared on Xbox Live on October 26, 2007, on PlayStation Store on November 1, 2007, and on PC on November 2, 2007. The PC version is the last in the series to use CD-ROMs, which are succeeded by the usage of DVDs for the rest of the series. ProStreet is preceded by Need for Speed: Carbon and is followed by Need for Speed: Undercover.</resource>

Using a limited number of &amp;quot;steps&amp;quot; and a pickaxe, the player must dig and create a maze with monsters in it to defend the demon lord from heroes. More steps are given when a stage is cleared, based on how well the player did. The &amp;quot;steps&amp;quot; have another function, however, they are also used to add levels to monsters.

At first, the player must dig and create the maze while creating monsters before a hero comes to capture the demon lord. When the hero appears and is going to enter the maze, the player must take the demon lord and change his location, preferably making him harder for the hero to find. When the hero gets into the maze, he will take random paths (if there are more than one) until he finds and captures the demon lord. The hero will fight against any monster that gets in his way.

When the hero captures the demon lord, he will retrace the same path, taking the demon lord with him. It is possible to create monsters to save the demon lord during this.</resource>

    <resource id="98eae45a221f931ea017ae3a5e5911f84ab38c7f" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">NumBlast is a puzzle game that follows the story of Aoyama and Akasaka, two Japanese students who find a cubic artifact called the NumBlast. Whilst running experiments on the artifact, Aoyama accidentally causes the artifact to give off a magical explosion, which turns Akasaka into a monkey.
They now have to turn Akasaka back into a human by solving the NumBlast puzzles.

Gameplay revolves around using a playing board filled with numbers and changing the positions of the numbers to make a group of four numbers in a 2x2 square, resulting in the numbers exploding, the ultimate goal being to clear the board of numbers.
There are 3 modes of play you can choose: Endless (detonating numbers until the board is clear), Time Trial Mode (gives you 3 minutes to get the highest possible score) and Puzzle Mode (which challenges you to complete the board within a limited number of rotations).</resource>

One Piece: Romance Dawn

Preface: This is still a Japanese-only title. I know Japanese, so this presented no obstacle to me in playing the game, but for the purposes of this review, I will assume that you also know Japanese or are using a translation patch to make the game's text legible to you. Wandering in the dark, language-wise, will obviously produce a very different gaming experience that I would estimate would warrant knocking at least three points off the score, unless you enjoy such strange challenges.

Romance Dawn, taking its title from the first chapter of the ongoing, decades long manga, One Piece, is the first full-blown turn-based RPG to cover a sizable portion of the series' actual storyline (and not a non-canon story, as with real-time RPGs Unlimited Adventure and Unlimited Cruise). The gameplay elements alone make for a rather shallow RPG, but the One Piece coat of paint does its job well, and assuming you're a fan of the series, it is that aspect that makes playing Romance Dawn worthwhile.</resource>

Instead of discrete lives the game instead has a constantly depleting energy figure. Getting hit drastically reduces the figure, and at zero the game ends. Enemy patterns appear in waves, and after every four waves a mothership will appear that replenishes energy. Enemies come in several varieties with unique abilities, such as tiny enemies that appear in swarms, saucers that shoot bullets and missiles, and space ships that bank and sink into the background in a simulation of 3D space.</resource>

The player can choose between numerous (partly licensed) teams and use the usual playing modes, e.g. training, cup championships or the Master League with a few additional managerial components. The main differences to Pro Evolution Soccer 2007 are a new adaptive AI for the Master League and a new animation system.

This version of the game has numerous differences to the NextGen version: It lacks the ability to perform dives and to change the player wall during free kicks. In return there are a few additional features: more stadiums (33 instead of 12), matches with random players, a more extensive training mode, the World Tour mode (about 100 challenges where the player has to solve certain goals in pre-defined situations, e.g. scoring a goal in a limited time) and unique community features, e.g. a friends list or private tournaments. The latter - along with all savegames - are compatible to both the PSP and PS2 version.</resource>

    <resource id="ee3a6b82f664696fcdbba03314a09b7983720cc0" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">The rapping pup, PaRappa, dreams of impressing his friend, the beautiful Sunny Funny, and going out on a date with her.  But what he lacks is confidence - help PaRappa rap his way through learning Kung Fu, a driving test, cooking and more, all in order to get the girl.  And remember - You Gotta Believe!

PaRappa the Rapper is a game based on lyrics, music and rhythm.  The game itself is very basic - each stage has a 'teacher', that PaRappa must follow.  You'll see the teacher say some lyrics, and then PaRappa must copy the teacher by pressing the appropriate buttons to repeat those lyrics back.  Rap well, and you'll be able to continue; fudge up the lyrics, and the music will start to distort and the teacher will become displeased.  Continue to mess up and you'll fail the stage.

Of course, the goal is not to copy the teacher, but instead to outperform them - you can do this by improvising in the song's gaps.  Listen to how the song goes, and improvise in time to the music; if you perform well enough, the teacher will step aside, leaving you to freestyle on your own!

The PSP version of the game is a remake of the PlayStation original.  However, it includes a few upgrades, such as a 16:9 display, sharper graphics, game sharing, multiplayer support of up to four players, and the addition of song remixes, which can be downloaded via the internet onto your Memory Stick Duo.</resource>

Erwin plans to siphon spectral energy from the Spectral Realm to power his army of robots in order to rule the world. Pac-Man uses punching, Rev Rolls, Butt-Bouncing and various new Power Pellets to defeat Erwin and his minions. Pac-Man also pilots Toc-Man in a battle against Erwin’s robot army.

Joined by Pac-Man’s old enemies, Orson, Clyde and Pinky, and new friends along the way, Pac-Man adventures through different levels from a boneyard of old bots to a burning tower, up mountains, through deserts and the Spectral Realm to destroy all of Erwin’s Spectral Syphons. In this title, Pac-Man has also been given full speech, voiced by Martin T. Sherman.</resource>

In this epic adventure [a truncated version of the console game with 15 levels], you will experience the fateful legend of Kong from the perspective of both man and beast. Survive Skull Island as unwitting hero Jack Driscoll in first-person shooting action, and unleash the staggering power of the 25-foot-tall King Kong in third-person action sequences. Use everything in the jungle to your advantage, exploiting the natural food chain of the prehistoric predators and grabbing objects from the environment to kill those hunting you.</resource>

    <resource id="10891c32af18ba0c4c09fd63be10706072dded1a" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Phantom Brave is a strategy RPG which takes place in the world of Ivoire. Ivoire consists of vast seas and numerous islands; it used to be a peaceful place, but an ancient (and powerful) force is now threatening life in the various lands. The character you control in the game is Marona, a 13 year old orphaned girl. Marona has the ability to communicate with phantoms, an ability that brings a lot of resentment from other people but will help her to head out into the world and solve the problems that are occurring. A phantom known as Ash acts as Marona's guardian; as the game progresses, other phantoms will join your party, each of which have different capabilities.

The game features a turn based combat system. During battles, Marona is able to attack enemies by herself, and she can also summon phantoms in her party to help out. To summon phantoms, you will need to confine them to an object on the screen (such as a rock or tree). Once confined to an object, you will then be able to control the phantom in battle, though phantoms only remain controllable for a limited number of turns. The object you confine a phantom to will affect it's abilities; for example, a rock may make a phantom stronger but move slower. By defeating enemies in battle you earn experience points allowing to level up and become more powerful.</resource>

    <resource id="baa4a748cb6398f1a0ddf494c89ed8c03e77bed7" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Pilot Academy is a flight simulator on the PSP which encompasses all eras of flight, ranging from historic WWI fighter planes such as the famous Fokker Triplane (flown by the &amp;quot;Red Baron&amp;quot; Manfred von Richthofen) to modern military and civilian jet aircraft like the F-15, F-16 and Boeing 747. All aircraft names and designs are licensed.

In the initial lessons, the game teaches the player the basics of powered flight for both civilian and military purposes. The game uses all PSP buttons to deliver a flight simulation feel with the analog nub serving as a joystick. Controlling the flaps, air brakes, raising and lowering the landing gear as well as using the tail rudder are also possible. Military aircraft feature air-to-ground missiles, air-to-air-missiles, a machine gun and flares for self defense against missiles. The only thing missing from the simulation is a fuel gauge, but since most missions are rather short, this was probably a deliberate design choice. 

After civilian and military flight lessons are completed, the player is free to choose from various missions and challenges. Completing a task successfully unlocks new aircraft in the player's hangar which can then be flown any time in free flight mode (but only on the tropical map). Distinctions are also awarded for completion of a mission based on time taken, aircraft integrity, completion of objectives and level of excitement/comfort of passengers (if any) and determine the level of proficiency of the player pilot.

Flights take place over different types of terrain including tropical, desert, snow covered mountains and canyons and in varying weather conditions like rain, snow and even in a storm. Some missions begin while already airborne, while others require the player to taxi onto the runway, takeoff and land after completing the objective.  

Multiplayer supports up to four players dogfighting against each other or cooperatively with planes from any of the four military eras, e.g. a dogfight between a WWII propeller plane like the P-51 Mustang or the Spitfire versus an F-14 Tomcat or F-16 Falcon is possible.</resource>

Each one has a range of ramps, combos, light sequences and targets to shoot, as well as general themes which are less influenced by real tables than those in Pinball Dreams.</resource>

Choose your chimp, then prepare to tackle various classes in Academy Mode. Each 'class' is actually a mini-game. Your goal is to complete as many mini-games as possible from the 9x9 grid, and score as many lines as you can (sort of like Noughts and Crosses). Mini-games range from mind-bending quizzes to wacky sports games, to the just plain silly, like protecting a roast banana from oncoming apes, or flying through the sky delivering parachutes to plummeting primates.</resource>

The game is set up as a 3D action-adventure in a free-roaming world that allows players to explores the islands and seas of the Caribbean.

Players will have to face off again Davy Jones, his Flying Dutchman crew and the villainous kraken in addition to the Chinese pirate Sao Feng, cannibals, other pirates, and the East India Trading Company.

Players must battle their way through the events of &amp;quot;Dead Man's Chest&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;At World's End&amp;quot; using a variety of sword and item attacks, in addition to a system called &amp;quot;Black Pearls&amp;quot;, which only allows players to block for so long until the Black Pearls are drained and no longer able to block until it recharges. Each character has their own special attack, and other weapons, such as pistols and daggers, can be found for use in combat.

The console and PC versions uses regular controls, whereas the Wii version makes use of the Wiimote for motion based attacks. The game makes use of quick time events called &amp;quot;Jackanisms&amp;quot;, which allow players to handle themselves through certain events in a manner that Captain Jack Sparrow would.</resource>

The Collostropolan leaders have decided to solve the problem by invading the neighboring country of Mungola. Since Mungolans are simple, earthy types they don’t expect much of a struggle. Mungola’s defense force consists only of a single squadron of fighter planes – the F-27 Platypus.

Platypus is a side-scrolling shooter, where you use your little space craft to blast the enemy ships. Shooting some formations gives the player weapon upgrades for twenty seconds. All models in the game were designed in clay, photographed and then digitally coloured. There is 20 levels in four different worlds each with their own themes and enemies.

The PSP version includes minor changes. It adds worlds, ships, and enemies not in the original game, constructed from existing graphics, with new movement patterns. The weapon balancing and bonus scoring system have been changed. Enhancements include a save system, a new Survival mode and Wi-Fi multiplayer action for 2 players.</resource>

This PSP version is the first entry in the series to be released outside of Japan. It is a remake of the first two PoPoLoCrois titles for the PlayStation seamlessly reworked into a single game with various enhancements. You play as the 10-year old Prince Pinon who needs to find way of saving his sleeping beauty mom, and the whole kingdom, from Ancient Evil.

While playing you are able to pick up different characters to form a party, each with a different personality and combat style. Battles occur randomly and they become semi-strategic turn-based if you turn off the default auto combat option. Combat doesn't take you to a different screen, it just defines a spot in the background moving it to a diagonal grid, where you will move and fight the enemy. In these fights, there are many battle options, from special skills to tag-team attacks. Actions are based on an action gauge that fills up. The game can be saved manually or automatically.</resource>

The player's goal is to rescue a beloved princess from the enemy castle. There is a catch, though; the adversary has been feeding her magical cake to make her heavier to carry. Therefore, it will take much of the army working together to carry her across the battlefield. Team balance and strategy is crucial in Fat Princess: Fistful of Cake because players can switch between five different character classes, literally, at the drop of a hat. The name of the game is cooperation, whether it is flinging another player over the enemy's walls with a teeterboard, healing him while he charges into battle, or adding muscle to carry the hearty princess to safety. The comical, quirky, and loveable cast of characters in Fat Princess: Fistful of Cake has been developed specifically for optimization on the PSP. Now players can have their cake and take it on the go, too.</resource>

    <resource id="9ac396aaa175848c9ea8288b39c1c7af8805cf26" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">An evil magician crashes a teenagers' party, uses his powers to load all their cars on his trailer and transform them into miniature cars themselves. The friends Hannah, Claire, Vicky, Roger and Mitch need to free themselves by racing pocket cars on tracks, where winning races is awarded with soul gems and soul shards that can return them to their human form.

Races are grouped together in different soul challenges with identical gameplay but different settings such as a garden or a bathroom. Since the cars are very small, the roads are loaded with huge items such as bottles and everyday appliances. The tracks have short-cuts, jumps and slopes, as well power-ups that destroy the environment, provide rockets or freeze the opponent's car. There are four camera perspectives (all third-person) and a button to reset the car when straying away from the track.

Next to the soul races there are time trial and practice modes. The car park has many vehicle models with different statistics, liveries and decals. Most of these still need to be unlocked at the start of the game. Aside from single-player games, there are online play modes with game modes as race, soccer, and domination.</resource>

Notes scroll toward the bottom of the screen along nine tracks, and the player must tap the correct buttons in time with the music to play along. Play well, and the &amp;quot;groove meter&amp;quot; increases, but play poorly and it will drop. If the groove meter is high enough at the end of the song, the player can move on to the next song.

This release includes all of the tracks from the first game, along with the new tracks from the arcade release for a total of over 40 songs to play. Several new high-difficulty modes for advanced players have been added, and there is also support for a miniaturized 5-button version of the game called Dokodemo pop'n music that can be played on the PocketStation or Dreamcast VMU. It also functions as a Key Disc for latter Append Disc releases in the series, much like Konami's other Bemani franchises.</resource>

Twenty-five years ago Elfrenne destroyed the demonic forces that were threatening the country. Now the queen has died, and Gradriel is proclaimed to be the future savior of the land, as it was not entirely purged of all evil. And indeed, an evil spirit has secretly invaded Valendria and is trying to take control over Gradriel's two older sisters. Will the young princess succeed in defeating the evil?

This is an action/platform RPG, somewhat similar to the third game in  Ys series. The entire game world is a side-scrolling platform on which fights, exploration, and conversation with the NPCs take place. The combat is detailed and contains elements of fighting games. Although the princess develops like a RPG protagonist, she can also use various physical moves in combat: kick, dash, defend, crouch, etc.</resource>

Now, the match feels more real to the actual play as players make mistakes more often and passes don't go too well if the player is on the wrong foot, or makes a bad turn. The new gameplay may require slight adjustment for players to switch from older versions to this one. The standard modes are here, match mode (with newly added memorial match), various leagues, and cups. Some more teams now have their proper names (like &amp;quot;Arsenal&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Chelsea&amp;quot;), and are having up to date players in the teams. Also, new weather condition has been added, snow.</resource>

Cities are in chaos as the regular police is helpless. Therefore, a special unit is formed to deal with such a threat, a special unit called the Pursuit Force. You are part of that unit.

Your task is to hunt down the criminals and let none escape. To do so, you will drive your fast car on the streets while being perfectly able to switch the vehicles on the run. Yes, on the run, you can jump from car to car during high speed, usually jumping on the different cars from the criminals and taking them out one by one. But there's more to that than just driving different cars, you can drive motorcycles, trucks, boats, even commandeer a helicopter, though there are occasions you'll have to deal with the criminals on foot.

You can select Time Trial, Race, or Career mode. The latter one plays story-wise which gives you certain variety of cases to choose from. As you get promoted while successfully solving the cases, new cases will become available depending upon your rank, from mere Officer to police Commander. This is a highly fast-paced game with non-stop action, as most missions leave very little room for mistakes.</resource>

There is word of an award so the students are busy searching high and low for it. Naturally our heros, Amitie and her school nemesis Raffine, make their way toward the distant dark castle. Challenging, and being challenged by, everyone you come across in a game of, Puyo Pop!  

A puzzle game of the falling-block variety the goal of which is to clear your blocks (Puyos) by is the combining four or more of the same color which will vanish. This will produce Nuisance Puyos. These colorless Puyos will fall onto you opponents screen, thus blocking chains and combos they could create. These pesky Puyos can only be exterminated by removing neighboring Puyos.

When an opponent send Nuisance Puyos to you screen you can try to &amp;quot;offset&amp;quot; by clearing your own Puyos and limiting the number that would fall on your screen. This will also increase your Fever Meter. When this meter fills you will be given a set of prearranged Puyos with which you can wrack up giant combos and send tons of Nuisance Puyos to you opponent. When any players field becomes so full they can no longer drop Puyos they lose the game.

Puyo Pop Fever features a Two Player Mode. Some versions allow for more people such as the DS version which allows up to eight players to compete in free-for-all or team modes.</resource>

Math wiz Ringo Andou is scared to death of this strange situation, until she is schooled in the ways of Puyo by the familiar face of Arle Nadja. When Arle suffers a mysterious headache and disappears, Ringo sets out on a mission to stop the ongoing flood of Puyo. But the plot thickens as Ringo uncovers plot after diabolical plot and realizes the very existence of mankind is at stake.

Puyo Puyo 7 is different from other Puyo Puyo games in that the story mode is told in 6 acts of varying numbers of episodes, as Ringo Andou (and the friends she meets along the way) travel to place after place, battling popper after Puyo popper to stop a mysterious force from flooding the world with Puyo. There are 19 players in all, with 5 being new (including Ringo). The gameplay, however, is quite similar to Puyo Puyo 15th Anniversary - swamp your opponents in a flood of Nuisance Puyo across 5 (less compared to 15th Anniversary) different game play modes and move on to the next area. 

As usual, there is also the battle mode, where up to 4 players (8 on the DS version) compete to see who is the best Puyo popper. As in 15th Anniversary, only the Original Puyo Puyo, Puyo Puyo 2, and Fever rules are available in 8-player games.</resource>

The game includes a single-player arcade mode, as well as a story mode with 3 different characters and campaigns that take you across the game world battling different sets of enemies. The &amp;quot;fever&amp;quot; meter from the previous game returns (which increases the number and abilities of the garbage puyos you send depending on how many puyos you chain in succession) and a new ranking system has been implemented that awards you money you can use between stages to buy special items that modify the game rules in your favor.</resource>

The puzzle part is played on a board with vertical divider line in the middle. The goal is to push the divider line back to decrease the opponent's territory until no more moves are possible. This is done by matching groups of three gems into like colours along the divider line. These groups fall on the board horizontally. Pushing the divider line back is done by destroying rage gems. There are also special abilities and a sidekick known as a Warbeast that attacks the enemy when a sufficient amount of gems of certain colour has been cleared.

Removing gems also enables the player to collect mana, power spells and items that are then used to attack the opponent and reduce their board space. In addition to the main puzzle game, there are five other mini-games ranging from upgrading the Warbeast companion to crafting new items, while navigating a number of different maps and completing simple quests.</resource>

The people of the world have used them for many things, from simple family heirlooms to even objects of worship. However, recently, a gang known as the Underworld has been going around collecting any and all Atomigems they can find. What exactly is their aim?

That's what Eril, known as the Azure Sorceress, intends to find out. Along the way, she'll meet some friends who will help her on this mission, such as Yute, the son of a famous trader, and Earon, a highly-skilled martial arts fighter. Can they find out exactly what the Underworld is up to? And can they do anything to stop it, or are they already too late...?</resource>

The conflict eventually ground to a halt and an uneasy truce was reached, as neither nation had the resources to continue fighting. Even so, the animosity between the two parties never faded, but smoldered beneath the surface, always threatening to explode into flames. In the resulting tenuous peace, the people of the peninsula began to resume their normal lives, always aware that the war could resume at any time.</resource>

It is also known as New Rainbow Islands Hurdy Gurdy Daibouken in Japan. It is an enhanced remake of the arcade game Rainbow Islands.

Bub and Bob, the two main characters in the series, are against an evil recording company that seeks to pollute the Rainbow Islands' atmosphere by creating constant musical noise, therefore wilting the flora and mutating the fauna. In this game, Bub and Bob use a hurdy-gurdy (an old European musical instrument) as a weapon to create the rainbows.

The game follows the same vertical-scrolling system from the original, but it expands to a third dimension as there are platforms in the background which become accessible through the course of the game.

The game suffers from reviews stating that it had been overworked with new features, especially those that make this version of the game differ significantly from the original game.</resource>

The game features a nice selection of 24 tracks, 58 cars and music from all previous RR-games and in all aspects is faithful to the series' spirit. There are many game modes in the game, like a world tour-mode where player competes on the courses in order to earn new cars and tracks, Time Attack where one races around the tracks against time and also a multiplayer mode, which supports the ad-hoc, meaning that up to eight players can race against each other with only one game disc, with one player hosting, and others joining.</resource>

1. A new opening and ending CGI movie.
2. Many new tracks and songs from previous Ridge Racer games.
3. New SPECIAL class cars to challenge in duels and win.
 
Survival mode: In a four car race, after each round, the car to be in last place is eliminated from the pack.
4. Duel mode: A race against a single AI car.
5. Single Race mode has been replaced with an Arcade mode in which the player races not only against the pack of 11 cars but also has to reach checkpoints on the track to stay in the game. The options menu features a new setting to adjust the difficulty of Arcade mode.</resource>

The game is developed by Backbone Entertainment in conjunction with Harmonix and is distributed by MTV Games and Electronic Arts. The game was released in North America and Europe on June 9, 2009.

The core game is functionally similar to the note-matching gameplay of Harmonix's previous titles, Frequency and Amplitude, with the player responsible for playing all four instrumentsâ€”lead and bass guitar, drums, and vocalsâ€”using the Portable's controls. Game modes are similar to Rock Band's, and the soundtrack includes a number of songs that have already been a part of the Rock Band series. Additional tracks will be a time-limited exclusive to Unplugged before they are released as downloadable content for the console games. The game supports the addition of new songs that can be purchased through the PlayStation Store.

Rock Band Unplugged, in addition to being released separately, was also released as part of a &amp;quot;Limited Edition Entertainment Pack&amp;quot; that also includes a Rock Band Unplugged-branded PSP, a 4GB memory card, and a voucher to download the movie School of Rock. A voucher for an exclusive 5-song demo of &amp;quot;Rock Band Unplugged&amp;quot; that is compatible with downloadable content is included with the PSP Go.</resource>

The main focus lies on the realistic simulation of the driving physics. During the season the player takes the role of one of 27 licensed athletes and compete in 13 of the race locations of the season 2008/2009 (the NÃ¼rburgring is not in available). There are up to eight sessions per race, including free training and warm ups. In the garage the player can tune almost every aspect of his bike in detail. Beginners this can be delegated to an engineer. Of course there is also the option to play just a single racing weekend or to start in a quick race. 

In comparison to its predecessor there are two notable changes: driving helps for novice players and 20 challenges. In these the player either has to solve certain problems in pre-defined situations, e.g. winning the race with worn out brakes or reaching checkpoints in a limited time frame.</resource>

    <resource id="411f639ba841ceec4bedd22764264dbf8df9843b" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Tactical Strike is the third hand-held game in the long-line of the SOCOM series. This one differs from its console cousins. Not only can the player choose to control a squad of US Navy Seals, but the player can alternatively decide to control one of several foreign units that have roles comparable to the SEALS, such as the Dutch KCT, German KSK, Australian SASR, the Italian 9th Parachute Assault Regiment, the Spanish UOE, the British SAS, the French GIGN or the South Korean 707th Special Mission Unit.

The story takes place in Panama, as the players national ambassador and the Panamanian ambassador are seized by a local group of rebel narcotrafficante kidnappers, referred to as &amp;quot;La Mano Los Gente&amp;quot; -- though it is worth noting that this is egregiously ungrammatical Spanish, since it would translate literally as &amp;quot;The Hand The People,&amp;quot; because the &amp;quot;de&amp;quot; is missing! The fictional group of criminals, with their comical name, hold the pair for ransom and it is up to the player to conduct an increasingly complex and difficult operation in order to rescue the two diplomats.

The gameplay is different from other SOCOM games, in that there remains a squad of four men to control, but instead of bringing up a menu interface and then pointing the cursor to a certain location to give an order, this new game features a locator box that is moved along the surface of the ground. This lets the player choose a specific target location or rally point as the case may be, and then to use a certain button to instruct soldiers to take cover, establish crossfire, defend, ambush, etc. One can, of course, order them to use particular weapons such as close combat knives, rifles, satchel charges for demolition, pistols, a shot fired by the squad's sniper, or thrown grenades. When choosing an aimpoint to throw a grenade, a dynamically adjustable moving arc appears, to show what trajectory it will follow.

There are nine different non-linear missions to play, with the option of two instant action missions for each stage, and the story is told with pre-rendered cut-scenes.</resource>

With a different front end interface to previous versions, which looks like a mix between MTV and a doodle book, you select the challenge you want to take part in rather than boarding your way to the event as previous versions.

With improved controls making &amp;quot;Monster Jumps&amp;quot; (Uber Tricks) easier to perform, everyone can look like a professional without learning button combos. As before, if you perform the same trick over and over, you won't get the points to take your skier/snowboarder from a novice to what they have a labeled &amp;quot;black-diamond-dominating rockstar&amp;quot;.

The game promises big jumps, fast pace and lots of coloured, detailed slopes.

The GameCube version delivers Mario, Luigi and Peaches on the slopes as special characters. Each has their own moves and is accompanied by Mario-style music.</resource>

It is more like Dynasty Warriors for the PlayStation Portable, giving it an &amp;quot;Empires&amp;quot; style of playing.

The gameflow is mainly separated into two stages: the Strategy phase and the Action phase. During the first stage, the map is separated into colored squares and the player is asked to move their character in a turn-based fashion. Terrain affects how the player can act during this stage. What usually follows is the action phase, which asks the player to defeat as many opponents possible within 60 seconds. These stages can tip the battle in the player's favor.

There are four main armies for the player to participate in: the Takeda (Western), Uesugi (Eastern), Nobunaga, or the solo army. Completing the game with these four factions unlocks the final stage in the game. It guest stars characters from Dynasty Warriors 4. The game features a Story mode, Free mode and VS mode.</resource>

The game features 47 unlockable monkey cars each with two specializations: one for drifting and one for acceleration. The main game consists four racing tracks in a Grand Prix:  The Beach, The City, The Graveyard and The Jungle.

Gamers create a team consisting of two heroes from the series and face off in battle against another player. The game will support up to four players ad hoc. This game feature characters from Sengoku Basara: Samurai Heroes (called Sengoku Basara 3 in Japan) like Ishida Mitsunari and the revamped Tokugawa Ieyasu. Token Sengoku Basara characters Date Masamune and Sanada Yukimura return as playable characters.

New stages include a different take on a section in Sekigahara from Sengoku BASARA: Samurai Heroes. The PSP version will have height differences, which means that battles will also be taken above ground. Speaking of which, the game will now feature new aerial combat elements due to fan request. Characters can now pull off combos while in mid-jump.</resource>

Players choose one of six supernatural characters to take on various demons and giant steampunk enemies. The namesake &amp;quot;cannon&amp;quot; is a new type of attack, a powerful single shot that players charge up; players can also use a standard rapid-fire attack, and a Dodonpachi-style laser that slows down the player when firing.</resource>

Occurring in the same time frame as the first game, Valkyria Chronicles III is a side story that follows the exploits of an unwanted and castigated Gallian Army squad during the Imperial invasion of 1935. Contrasting the previous games' bright outlook and recognition for their protagonists, Valkyria Chronicles III explores the themes of being outcast and the search for redemption.

But before the player can go on the slope, he has to create his character by choosing not only from different body looks but also from different clothes and snowboards.

During the course of the game the player earns money by completing the challenges which can in return be invested in more stylized clothes and additional types of snowboards. Each of the boards has six stats like balance or speed and not all of them are the best possible option for every given situation. While in a race speed is an important factor, a board with a higher rating in rotation allows for better stunts.

The game puts the player in an open world with him free to roam around the slope as he pleases. Several lifts and even a helicopter bring him to different starting locations but if he wants, he can also walk and discover hidden areas by doing so. By doing tricks, with controls using mainly the analog sticks similar to Skate, the player earns respect points. And on the track are, besides many obstacles to perform tricks on, challenges like the Jibfest, in which only tricks on rails and boxes count or Freestyle in which every trick counts. Others include the Death Race, in which the player needs to get to the goal before everyone else but as the name suggests, everything is allowed including ramming opponents and throwing snowballs to get them off-balance. There are also some challenges like King of the Hill that can only be done with at least one other human player joining in.

The multiplayer mode is basically an extension of the single player experience. Everything that is available in single player, can also be done with other players online or over LAN. The other players are also just dropped into the open world with the freedom to just do what they want on the server.</resource>

Abandoning the post-apocalyptic themes of the original series, the story takes place in modern Japan. The player character is an unnamed college student who is attacked by demons along with his girlfriend; they are saved by the timely appearance of a suave demon-hunter named Kyouji. Shortly thereafter, Kyouji is found dead under suspicious circumstances. The protagonist is then trapped inside of a warehouse and murdered by a deranged killer named Sid. Rather than stay dead, the player finds himself in the reanimated body of the slain Kyouji, and escapes from the morgue. With the help of Kyouji's voice, which guides the player from inside his head, the main character joins up with Kyouji's female partner Rei in order to save the life of his girlfriend, who is still in danger.</resource>

The game features an original story with several fantasy elements. Shi Huangdi, a tyrannical ruler with mystical powers, has been revived. With the power to resurrect old heroes and gods at his command, he desires to create an eternal empire for himself. The heroes of the Three Kingdoms band together to stop him.

A high-definition revamp called Shin Sangoku Musou Multi Raid 2 HD Version has been announced for the PlayStation 3. Players of this title will automatically have the original game's pre-order content available and can join parties with PlayStation Portable players. Save data from the original title is compatible with HD Version. 

Like its predecessor,  this is a multiplayer-based game drawing from the Dynasty Warriors series, with significant changes to &amp;quot;musou awakening&amp;quot; or fury modes, and aerial combat. Rather than following the battles between the three nations of Shu, Wu, and Wei, the story of this version revolves around the resurrection of the first Qin emperor.

Like Strikeforce Special, officer cards can be applied to city and fields for player benefit, as well as the ability to bring AI officers as help in single player. Players can now create quests, this and general participation with other players creates &amp;quot;community points&amp;quot;, leading to acquisition of rare items.</resource>

Another entry in the lengthy Shining franchise, Shining Blade abandons the grid-based tactics RPG battle system similar to games such as Fire Emblem and Tactics Ogre in favor of one that deeply resembles Valkyria Chronicles, another series by the same development house. In particular, much like Valkyria Chronicles, Shining Blade's battles are conducted with a mixture of turn-based and real-time elements, with enemy and allied sides each getting individual turns, but with the specific actions within those turns otherwise unfolding in real time. Various other subsystems made famous by Valkyria Chronicles such as potentials, character-specific abilities that can be triggered under specific circumstances, also feature prominently under different names. Unlike Valkyria Chronicles, however, Shining Blade features a heavier emphasis on individual character growth, with party members levelling up individually like in traditional RPGs, rather than doing so in bulk along with other characters of the same class as in the case of the former.</resource>

As a straight port, not much has changed except for three really notable elements.

First, the dancing sequences have been tweaked slightly. Now it is up to your twitch/reaction time to get the job done right, as opposed to being able to simply watch the govenor's daughter's hand motions and body language.

The second tweak is the addition of being able to physically hunt for treasure. In the previous versions, you would find a map, sail to the right spot and land. If you had the location right, you would have your booty. Not so in this version. Now you take four of your crewman ashore and have to find the red &amp;quot;X&amp;quot;. All while avoiding booby-traps and vicious jaguars. If you lose your crew, it's back to the ship. If you make it to the &amp;quot;X&amp;quot;, then it is time to start raking in the doubloons.

The third change has been made to the sneaking segments. If you want to sneak into a port, it is handled in the exact same way; creeping through the streets, slipping past guards, hiding behind fences and so on. However, your character now moves in a grid, as opposed to being able to move a bit more freely. This does not change the gameplay, but it is possible to accidentally step into a guard's line of sight because you cannot stop moving forward until your character reached the middle of the next tile.

Next to the original game content, the PSP version adds bonus treasure missions, with more plunder and new locations. The game has been tweaked for widescreen display. Multiplayer is supported for up to 4 players, through Wi-Fi, Ad Hoc.</resource>

    <resource id="0474d735da74bbb2dec5a710a7d5035c9840fdd0" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">The PSP release of Silverfall is a port of the initial PC release from 2007, with various adaptations to make it more suitable for the platform.

The player chooses one of 4 races (human, elf, troll, goblin) before starting his journey. The game remains - as in the initial version - a hack-and-slash RPG with a top-down view, with quests and dialogue with NPCs. The player's quest of saving the realm of Nelwë from the spreading evil also involves taking sides with either the adepts of technology, or those of nature.

The first visible difference from the PC release is the visual style. The cel shading has been abandoned while the textures and polygonal models have been downgraded. The game now has a more colourful palette.

A difference concerning the game mechanic is the absence of companions. The development team's reasoning for this is the console's less resources available. As a compensation though, the number of enemies on screen has been increased.

The last notable difference with the PC release is that the open world environment has turned into a succession of levels. The reason for this is to adapt the game to the portable style of the console, as the developers had in mind play sessions of ten minutes, although this doesn't affect the c:a 20 hours duration of the campaign.</resource>

The Arcade mode is the same type just the puzzles in random order and no cut-scenes while the Multiplayer mode has the ability to connect four players using the Ad Hoc to compete against each other.</resource>

It has typical Sonic gameplay, but with a twist - players race through 2.5D stages against a CPU character, only progressing when they get to the end of the stage first.

You can choose from five characters: Sonic, Knuckles, Shadow, Silver, and Metal Sonic. There are six zones in the story mode, split into two acts with a boss at the end of the second act. Defeating bosses is not sufficient, players also need to do it before the opponent gets the job done. Next to the story mode, there is also a challenge mode and a cup mode. In the wireless play mode players can challenge other PSP owners. While racing, players can collect power-ups with special attacks. Opponents can also be pushed around during the race.

Players can also collect cards by completing certain tasks in the game and these cards can be traded in the wireless play mode.</resource>

Characters still obtain various power ups throughout the stage to attack their rival.  The Boss stages are also the same in that you have to defeat the boss before your rival does. Players still collect cards for completing various challenges.

The playable character roster includes all the characters from the previous game (Sonic, Knuckles, Shadow, Silver, and Metal Sonic) along with the addition of Tails, Espio the Chameleon, and Rouge the Bat. 

There is an added Freeplay mode so that you may play stages previously cleared without having to race against another character.  Some additions were made to the multiplayer challenges including Knockout, Ring Battle, Race, King of the Hill, Capture the Chao, and Tag play modes.</resource>

It also future a wireless mode with support of up to four players.

In the new Future Mode the game takes place in 13 stages from Pluto to Earth in full 3D. You have to shoot down the mothership, which spawns small invaders over time. This mode supports three viewpoints. In addition to the normal shots there is also Beat Attack accessed by triangle button. If you time your shots with the music using Beat Attack, they will become more powerful. You can also wipe out all aliens on the screen by holding down the triangle button until the fourth beat and then letting go.</resource>

Taking a cue from other recent arcade classic updates, Space Invaders Extreme takes the gameplay of the 1978 classic, and reinvents it, giving power-up blasters, boss aliens, and an electronic soundtrack that plays in sync with the onscreen action.

Basic gameplay remains the same: Players guide a ground based cannon either left or right, blasting an oncoming fleet of invaders before they reach the ground.  The main objective is to get as many points as possible before running out of lives.

Space Invaders Extreme introduces new elements, such as invader fleets that break pattern from their left to right descent, boss aliens that require several hits to destroy, power-ups that enhance the cannon, allowing the player to wipe out multiple invaders at once, while racking up combos.

Wi-Fi play is also possible, allowing player to team up cooperatively, or compete against the other.  The Nintendo DS version also has a feature for online ranking.</resource>

Speedball 2100, released only for the PlayStation, is a 3D version of Speedball 2 with more options such as choosing and renaming any team, instead of having to play with Brutal Deluxe. This version, released in September 2000, failed to win over gamers and press because it lacked the speed and gameplay of the originals.[citation needed]

Empire Interactive released Speedball 2: Brutal Deluxe onto Xbox Live Arcade on October 17, 2007.[14] The game features a 3D graphics mode in addition to the &amp;quot;classic&amp;quot; visuals, as well as additional teams and online play.[15] According to statements by the Bitmap Brothers, this version of the game takes place in the 24th century. It was eventually delisted from Xbox Live Arcade, but people who have already downloaded it are still able to play it.

Frogster Interactive Pictures released a remake developed by Kylotonn, Speedball 2 Tournament onto Steam in November 2007.[16] In February 2011, Tower Studios released another updated version called Speedball 2: Evolution, developed by Vivid Games for iOS. The game features multiplayer support and achievements via Game Center.[17] It was also released for the PlayStation Portable and PlayStation 3.

A remake for the PC titled Speedball 2 HD was released December 5, 2013 on Steam. It's developed by Vivid Games and directed by Jon Hare.[18]</resource>

Unlike the first game, however, the sequel is much more open-ended (a la Grand Theft Auto: Vice City), allowing Spider-Man free reign to explore New York City, and doing everyday tasks from stopping muggers, bank robberies and car-jackers, to delivering pizzas and snapping photos for the Daily Bugle.  

However, the action becomes even more intense as not only does Spidey have to keep the streets safe in general for the citizens of Manhattan, he also has to face up against such super villains as Rhino, Shocker, Mysterio and Calypso, as well as a few entanglements with the Black Cat along the way to square off against Dr. Octopus and save New York in the process!</resource>

Players need to guide a shiny ball dubbed a xorb through high-tech environments at a high speed. The tracks are narrow and it is easy to drop off at any time, so precise steering is needed.

Games can be played in an arcade mode with forking paths or in a career mode where new tracks are unlocked gradually. Courses are time-limited and set in very different environments. Checkpoint allow the player to respawn at certain sections. While playing, power-ups can be collected to access air brakes and other bonuses. The xorbs can be completely customized in terms of colour. Other game modes are time trial, three multiplayer modes and a bowling mini-game. In certain game modes the xorbs can be armed with weapons such as rockets and missiles, which also deform the xorb when taking damage.</resource>

Fortunately, Ronyx and Ilia, members of a Terran Alliance reconnaissance mission, beam down to the surface just in time. They explain that the plague is actually a biological weapon, and they take the defense-force to the space vessel to discuss how to save Roak from this mysterious attack.</resource>

In the game the player learns more about the mysterious bounty hunter Cad Bane and hunts down the all-new Skakoan super villain Kul Teska in a gameplay style very similar to Lego Star Wars.

The game is fully built around drop in/drop out-coop for two players. This means each mission in this 3rd-person-action-adventure features two famous characters from the TV series including Obi-Wan Kenobi, the padawan Ahsoka and Captain Rex but separated by class. The players either control commandos or Jedi characters - never both mixed as they have totally different abilities and limitations. If no second player is available, the AI will automatically take over the second character and help overcome the many obstacles waiting ahead - mostly in form of several different kinds of separatist droids. While the players can use their lightsaber or blaster to fend them off, the Jedi characters also have the ability to ride the droids by jumping onto them from behind. This is not only useful to blast through enemy lines but is also used to solve specific riddles preventing the characters from moving on. In addition the droids can be forced to dance with every other droid on the screen following his lead making them defenseless. These dances are unique for each droid and need to be bought first in the shop. Also available there: funny masks and combat upgrades like stronger blasters or a more powerful force-push.

To buy these things, the players have to unlock them first and then need to invest points which are gained by killing enemies as well as by successfully completing missions or the mini-games. These mini-games are scattered around the levels and turn up once a specific section has been completed. They mostly involve killing as many enemies as possible in a short amount of time. Each kill in succession both during normal gameplay and the mini-games also ranks up the multiplier adding even more points to the account. Once a player dies, he will respawn at the nearest checkpoint either immediately if he plays alone or after the second player has reached one - both times without any penalties.</resource>

Gameplay
Elite Squadron allows players to participate in combat on foot, in ground vehicles or in space. Players are also able to enter capital ships and, once the shields are down, fight the enemy inside on foot. The ground-space transitions are accompanied by short cutscenes while the game loads the next area. The same is also true of entering or exiting a capital ship. This is the first Battlefront game to allow players to fly from ground to space battles. The consequences of each battle will depend on the players actions, meaning that each individual enemy killed can affect the outcome of a result. The battlefront will not be one giant, seamless map, but a compilation of inter-connected, smaller size areas, each one capable of affecting the other.

Elite Squadron features &amp;quot;Heroes and Villains&amp;quot; gameplay.
It includes playable characters such as Luke Skywalker, Boba Fett, Darth Vader, Darth Maul, The Emperor and Kit Fisto, and the Heroes and Villains mode (Assault Mode) last featured in Star Wars: Battlefront II. Pre-release screenshots also show that General Rahm Kota, a character from Star Wars: The Force Unleashed is playable, as well as other characters from Renegade Squadron, such as Col Serra. The Heroes and Villains mode is displayed quite conveniently after a demo had been released on the PlayStation Network. Other game modes have been implied, with a focus on multiplayer, such as a deathmatch mode. Also, the Galactic Conquest mode, has undergone an enhancement on the PSP. In Galactic Conquest, two players are able to share a single PSP, and compete against each other in a strategy based game mode. PSP Players are able to mix elements from the Star Wars saga and put them into locations and situations that never happened, allowing for full customization. The story mode has been called &amp;quot;a huge step up from previous story modes&amp;quot;, and was praised for incorporating the controls into the mission. It was also revealed that making progress in the story, and completing objectives, was the way to unlock customization props.</resource>

As the plot unfolds, players will learn how Han Solo recruited and assembled his team and used their many talents for missions in Korriban's Valley of the Sith, the rocky remains of Alderaan, and the fiery ashes of the volcanic planet, Sullust. In addition to single-player story missions, Renegade Squadron allows up to 16 players to compete via Infrastructure mode (eight-person support for ad hoc), with a special 100-point spending system to purchase custom kits with more than a million different combinations that can be used to create unique Star Wars characters.</resource>

This results in the downfall of the world economy and leads to a series of bloody conflicts in a world where the less fortunate strive for survival and live for one reason.... illegal racing.

In StateShift, racing machines with highly advanced morphing abilities compete in illegal underground racing around the world. Drivers go one on one with up to fifteen racers across nine tournaments. The titular stateshifts refer to special power-ups the player can unlock. With names such as Dragster, Ghost, Mamouth and Scorch, they can be used to drive faster or take corners more sharply, but require picking up energy cells on the tracks to recharge.. The game has various modes including a Career Mode to unlock new tournaments, tracks, characters and stateshifts, Time Trial, Challenges, Quick Race and various tutorials. The game also has a multiplayer mode via Wi-Fi.</resource>

There are ten anti-gravity vehicles available to use (two need to be unlocked), each with their own characteristics in speed, handling and acceleration. Vehicles are further divided into classes that are unlocked gradually. In later classes most of the vehicles become much faster and require more precise steering at fast speeds. In the same vein, players can unlock new tournaments.

There are a total of sixteen tracks to race on: twelve designed from the ground up for the PSP, as well as four classic Wipeout tracks. Each track has its own obstacles, as well as weapon pick-ups (both offensive and defensive) and speed boosters. The different game modes include single races, tournaments of sets of races, time trial and zone races. In the zone races the player goes through a number of increasingly difficult zones on his own without the ability to slow down until the vehicle explodes because of collision damage. New game elements are unlocked through the Tournament mode.

The game features wireless play over ad-hoc mode (PSP-to-PSP). It was also the first PSP game to support downloadable content with extra teams, tracks and PSP skins. Some of these packs are only available for specific regional versions. The European version of the game supports game sharing.</resource>

In this action/arcade game, players must pilot a futuristic troop transport copter as they fly through thirty dangerous levels filled with deadly traps in an attempt to rescue black stick men. The Evil Blue Stick Minions are out in force, with stick murder on their minds. Players must prevent their stick men from being burned alive, smashed, decapitated, blown up, electrocuted, dissolved by acid, and other classic demises. To combat the Evil Blue Stick Minions' zeppelins, paratroopers, and steam rollers, players can power up their copter with weapons like bombs, missiles, flame throwers, and more. Of course, players could just sit back and idly watch their stick men die hilariously horrible deaths...but then they wouldn't finish the level. What to do, what to do?</resource>

Featuring a roster of 37 characters, including 3 (Maki, Yun, Eagle) never seen outside of the GBA version, and 1 brand-new character (Ingrid) to the game, all with their own storyline, you can spend a very long time learning the intricacies of all the fighters.

It includes all the novelties introduced in the Alpha series, including finite defenses, the ability to recover and isms to customize special attacks. To help avoid the typical repetitiveness of the game, all the modes available in the previous home versions of Alpha 3, such as Arcade Mode, Training Mode, Edit Mode, World Tour, Dramatic Battle and Survival modes are all available in this version, along with the brand-new 100-man kumite (survival) and tag-team battle modes.

The PSP version also has network games (Ad-Hoc only) for up to 8 players, with four additional modes: VS Mode, Team Mode, Variable Battle (take three players into battle of which you control two, and the computer one), and the Dramatic Battle with multiple fighters going at it simultaneously.</resource>

In a quest to gain money respect, you race while shooting opponents at the same time. The story revolves around the character Buck, who ends up in a gang war. There are 14 games modes with 66 missions in total. Some examples:

1. Whip Race: a regular race for the finish line. Your car cannot be destroyed completely.
2. DeathRace: each round, the last one is dropped and your car can be wrecked.
3. DeathMatch: fight three other cars in an arena.
4. Gang Fight: team deathmatch in an arena
5. Survivor: stay alive as long as possible.
6. Domination: similar to the survivor mode but with different levels in a parking lot.
7. MineField: all weapons have been replaced by mines, so it becomes important to take the lead early.
8. Time Ride: time trial
9. Chase: race while being tailed by the police.
10. Escort: guard a vehicle with precious cargo and ensure that it stays at a minimum speed and is not damaged by opponents.

There is multiplayer support for up to 8 players, with 45 missions and 7 modes. Next to the regular modes, you can also play cooperatively with a single car -- one driver and one gunner.</resource>

The main mode of the game is called &amp;quot;Team Rumble&amp;quot;, where the player joins a clique, once doing must race in a series of events, winning these events will earn the player's team that &amp;quot;territory&amp;quot;, taking control of that area.  Players can also recruit rival racers to their clique by draining their &amp;quot;Spirit Points&amp;quot;, by smashing them into walls, guardrails and other cars, once depleted they will join the player's &amp;quot;clique&amp;quot;.

Not only do players race against rival teams, but also against their own in &amp;quot;ranking battles&amp;quot;, where a five car race will determine the rankings of the &amp;quot;clique&amp;quot;.  The player can climb through the rankings by winning these races, eventually leading to the team leader and if he/she is beaten, they will become team leader of their group.

There is also a &amp;quot;Time-Attack&amp;quot; mode where players must complete a race in an allotted amount of time and there is also the ability for players to battle online utilizing the Ad-Hoc as well.</resource>

This game is a remixed version of sorts which includes elements from the two previous games in the series, Strikers 1945 and Strikers 1945 II. There are six different planes to choose from (plus one secret one), each with their own attacks and special moves. Player weapons are weak to begin with, but firepower is improved (and secondary missiles gained!) by capturing Power-Ups. Super bombs can also be picked up, which destroy or damage any enemy or boss that is near the explosion.

There are also special moves which are obtained by charging up a gauge on the side of the screen. The more damage inflicted upon the enemy, the faster it fills up. Once the gauge is completely full, hold down the attack button for an instant to unleash the special attack. Several special shots can be held in reserve and used when necessary.

A new addition to the PSP version is an Endless Mode, which allows game replay with an enhanced difficulty immediately after the final boss is defeated.</resource>

    <resource id="ae83a74d9f138593194907f1a86e76ecb441f536" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Sunday vs Magazine is a crossover fighting game featuring dozens of characters from two of Japan's most popular shonen manga magazines: Shogakukan's Shonen Sunday and Kodansha's Shonen Magazine. It is a cel-shaded locked-view fighting game much like Street Fighter IV, and includes more than a dozen characters from each publisher's catalog, including contemporary series as well as older classic titles.

The game features three main modes. First, there is arcade mode, which pits the player against seven randomly-selected characters in order. Next is quest mode, which plays more like a scrolling beat-em-up and tasks the player with fulfilling various time-limited objectives like destroying targets or collecting keys, and which can be played solo or with up to three friend in wireless co-op. Last is the free battle mode, where the player can play a free battle against the computer or a friend via local wireless play.

The game system is relatively simple; characters have a limited set of moves, but they can be customized per character. Each character can also be upgraded using orbs earned in quest mode to buy new moves. In addition to regular moves, each character also has special super moves, which require use of a special bar which fills as the player lands blows. The player also unlocks assist characters as the game is played, which can be assigned to characters to give special assist moves. 

There is also a database mode where the player can read introductions for each of the playable and assist characters. The full list of featured series are as follows.

    <resource id="dfa46abce6be99353d4c99e31c54eb2666c9beb3" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Like its predecessor, Super Danganronpa 2 is a murder-mystery visual novel with action elements. The player character this time is Hajime Hinata, a new student at the elite Hope's Peak Academy. On his first day at the Academy, his class meets Usami, a pink rabbit who dresses like a magical girl and introduces herself as the students' teacher. She transports the kids to Jabberwock Island, an uninhabited tropical paradise, tells them that they are now on a class trip, and instructs them to befriend one another and collect hope fragments. But just as the students are getting used to their bizarre new situation, the sadistic Monokuma appears and throws them into a game of life and death.

Once again, the Hope's Peak students can only escape the island if one of them is able to murder a classmate without being caught. Once a murder takes place, a class trial will be held to decide the guilty party. If the murderer is not correctly decided upon, that student will be able to leave at the cost of everyone else's lives. However, if the students do find the culprit, that single person will be messily executed in an elaborate display.

The game is divided into six chapters, which are further broken into Daily Life and Deadly Life segments. In Daily Life, the player can engage in Free Time conversations, in which Hajime gets to know his classmates by selecting the correct options in their dialogue trees. Completing Free Time awards Skill Points that can be spent for various beneficial abilities during trials. This part of the game also includes exploration of Jabberwock Island and scripted scenes. Once a murder has been committed, Deadly Life begins, and Hajime must scour the island for evidence during the Investigation. When all evidence has been collected, the game switches to the Class Trial, a fully-voiced set of cutscenes and action-oriented minigames. The player must then use both their reflexes and logic to present the correct evidence, debate with other students, and draw the conclusions that will expose the true murderer.

An alternate mode called Island Mode is unlocked after beating the main game. It presents an alternate universe in which Monokuma does not sabotage the class trip, and the students collect the hope fragments as per the original plan. Free Time conversations may also occur in this game mode, as well as brand-new scenes for each character.</resource>

The goal of a level is to get rid of every fruit.</resource>

    <resource id="73f9857226b9e73367135b3a94d3ac0b81b7f696" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Our four heroes from Super Monkey Ball - Aiai, Meemee, Baby and Gongon - were enjoying a typical day, when they saw a flying machine crash down on a nearby island.  Soon, they discovered that the mysterious Naysayers have appeared, spreading discord and unhappiness all over the island.  And to top it all off, the prince and princess of the neighboring islands have gone missing on Jungle Island - if they aren't found and returned, there's sure to be trouble!  Can our heroes restore order to Monearth?

Super Monkey Ball Adventure takes the monkey rolling madness of the previous games and puts a story-based spin on it.  Choosing from one of the four monkeys, Players roll their way around the various islands of Monearth, talking to citizens and performing the tasks they request (such as delivering sandwiches, finding a missing baby, rescuing rare flowers, and more) to cheer them up.

Certain parts of the island are locked by 'Puzzle Gates' - these can only be unlocked by solving the puzzle stages which can be accessed in front of the gate.  Each pad transports you to a different Puzzle Realm.  The Puzzle Realm stages are the more familiar gameplay of Super Monkey Ball - simple looking stages where players must carefully (but quickly) roll their monkey to the finish line within the time limit.

Bananas can also be collected throughout the game - these are used as currency, and can be used to unlock new playable characters and puzzle stages.  They can also be given to particular unhappy citizens.  The monkeys will also learn magical chants as they progress through the game - these allow you to climb walls, set your monkey's ball on fire, use a boxing glove to attack, and more.

Also included in Super Monkey Ball Adventure are the famous Party Games - favorites like Monkey Race, Monkey Target and Monkey fight return.  There's also three new games: 'Monkey Cannon' - fire monkeys at enemy towers to steal their bricks for your own tower.  'Monkey Bounce' - bounce on a trampoline-like platform with your opponents, and try to claim as many squares as possible.  'Monkey Tag' - roll around a globe and try to collect as many balloons as possible.</resource>

game also has a series list that would please American fans, with 4 featured 
titles already released in America; Gundam: Char's Counterattack, Nadesico:

Gabe finds himself dealing with a beautiful woman from his past who harbors a shocking secret while he battles the Red Section, a para-military group in possession of Project Dark Mirror, a next-generation weapon of mass destruction. Using Precision Strike Tactics, advanced vision technology, and the latest in high-tech weaponry, Logan and his team perform surgical strike missions - too sensitive for a military response, too dangerous for civilian intelligence forces. Through the role of Gabe, players will have to be quick to strategize, as he is responsible to infiltrate, recon and execute decisively. Once inserted, Logan is his own authority - he must make life and death decisions, quickly choosing which course of action to take.</resource>

You blew through some of the fiercest opponents; taking down AJ Styles, devastating Robert Roode, and destroying Booker T., but then... everything changed. The politics behind the ring got heated, and not in your favor. When you finally claimed the title, someone came for you. And now you're here. You've woken up in what appears to be a rundown hospital in Mexico, and you can't remember a thing; your name, what you do, and certainly not why you're here. Lost in a land that is not your own, you need to get back to America. You hear talk of a local wrestling match where the winner goes on to wrestle at a nearby American Air Force base. This is the best shot you've got at getting home. But once you're in the ring, something strange happens. Your body seems to remember what your mind cannot. Punches, grapples, throws, and stomps all come naturally, as if you were a seasoned professional... This is where your journey begins. Find your way home, remember who you were, and claim what was rightfully yours.</resource>

The total number of initial songs is 70, and with the additional downloadable songs thereafter (like every Taiko PSP has done), it matches the massive songlists introduced on the Wii. Like the other recent games, the songlist has become a lot more geared towards Namco Originals. 
		 
Portable DX is also the first console Taiko to show the total number of drumrolls made in the song, and the second console Taiko game to introduce the all new Ura Oni difficulties. Other new mechanics in the game include organizing almost all unlockables in the game into an Achievement list, and a mode called Medley Mode, in which three, five, or eight different songs are put together and played all at once. Two new gameplay modifiers were also added into the game, which randomize the notes to different degrees. The Bell note has been removed from this release and the vestigial function of the analog stick is to produce sounds for fun. (http://taikotime.blogspot.ca)</resource>

Although the residents of the planet are unaware, this is actually a result of the actions of two entities named Widdershin and Aurora, the descenders of other worlds. As a last resort, the world's life-giving tree (the World Tree) uses the last of its power to create a defender - the player's own character. The hero, after being awakened by a strange creature named Mormo whose own world was destroyed by the same threat, learns of the danger to this world's World Tree. Upon hearing a scream, the player rushes to discover that a girl is being attacked by a soldier. After rescuing the girl, she introduces herself as Kannono, a member of an organization named Ad Libitum. This guild seeks to help the people of the world, fighting injustice and oppression. With no better leads, the player and Mormo set out to join Ad Libitum, hoping to learn more about the location of the devourer.</resource>

It allows the user to choose the topic at hand and if he speaks a related sentence in his language into the included microphone the tool translates it, complete with voice rendering. He can also choose between given statements, along with other functions like a unit converter or a alarm clock.

But TalkMan also features a &amp;quot;game mode&amp;quot; with two mini games. As expected these try to improve the player's listening and speaking skills. In the listening game Max, a blue bird and the tool's mascot, speaks one phrase in all languages (minus the player's native language) and the player has to guess its meaning by choosing one of four given answers. In the second game Max reads out a phrase in a language along with the translation into the player's native language. The the player has to repeat it and the the game gives a score based on his accentuation. Both games feature 25 difficulty levels.</resource>

The plot is set in feudal age Japan, and revolves around a group of ninjas and assassins who get involved into the kidnapping of Lord Gohda's single daughter, Princess Kiku. The game's protagonists are Rikkimaru and Ayame (both ninjas of the Azuma clan, working for Lord Gohda), Rin (a renegade ninja of the Beniya clan), and Tesshu (a medical doctor who works as a hired assassin at night). All four characters' campaigns can be selected right from the start. Each character's campaign encompasses eight missions.

The gameplay is once again based on the stealth-action genre's fundamental premise of completing the mission goals with being discovered as few times as possible, since the player characters are hopelessly outnumbered by the enemy guards. When the player approaches an unsuspecting enemy from behind, he can perform a stealth kill, which kills the target instantly without risking a fight.

Mission objectives vary from getting to a certain location on the map, taking out a certain target, to escorting NPCs to a designated area. A distance sensor indicates how great the distance is between the player and the closest enemy, but not the direction in which the enemy is. It also shows whether the enemy is aware of the players presence. As usual for the series, the player is free choose between several weapons and gadgets, which he obtains as reward for completing mission. The better the ranking he receives after the missions, the more and better items he receives.

Gadgets include throwing knifes, poisonous rice, healing potions, smoke bombs, grenades and many more. Aside from these optional accessories the player always has a trusty grappling hook at his disposal, which can be used to climb houses and ledges.

The game also features a mission editor to create story-driven single player missions, as well as multiplayer missions. The multiplayer mode can be played competitively and cooperatively with 2 players.</resource>

    <resource id="de04891c3dbc96f4ade395f5d6b584b46ed189e2" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Test Drive Unlimited lets the player choose one of several characters, both male and female, waiting at an airport to check in for their flight to the Caribbean dream island O'ahu located in Hawaii. The characters do not have different statistics, that only applies to the extravagant, licensed cars.

The whole island is accessible from the beginning and after the player has bought his first home and car, he can either drive around and look for events or load up the map and jump directly to a location of a race, a car salesman or other locations - similar to Need for Speed Underground. Every bought car has a built-in navigation system, guided by a woman's voice to get the player to his destination, either pre-programmed in the game or decided by the player.

There are over 125 different cars and motorcycles in different price ranges to choose from. From the Audi TT over the Jaguar XJ200 to the McLaren F1 and Kawasaki Z1000, there is everything the character needs as a young man or girl with too much money on their hands. Each car has its own, realistic set of characteristics such as speed or handling, but they all have a highly detailed exterior and interior in common.

The character starts with $200.000 dollars in his pocket, but there will not be anything left after buying a first car and home. Additional cash needs to be earned in different kinds of races from checkpoint challenges to time trials. The money cannot only be used to buy new homes and new cars (and a little tuning for those), but also to buy new outfits for the avatar.

The heart of Test Drive Unlimited is the online mode. Using a GameSpy account, players connect to the official TDU server immediately after loading the game. New options become available online, such as a meeting lounge where the statistics and looks of other players can be looked up. It also provides access to player-created matches shown on the map screen. Creating a race  here also works in the singleplayer modes. At any location, the start and finish can be defined, as well as the type of the race, which type/classes of cars or bikes are allowed and how many people can participate. If not all slots have been filled up by other players, the AI will take control of the rest.

The PSP and PS2 versions have a lower visual quality and lack a few features, such as manual transmission, avatar customization, certain cars and all motorcycles, dealership and tuning shop NPCs, the vehicle interior camera angle and certain missions. They do include Master Points and Auto GPS, and certain default vehicles only available for the 360 version through download packs.</resource>

The main plot line is that Globo-Joy, the rival park owners and main antagonist from the first game, are trying to destroy the good name of Thrillville by putting saboteurs in your park.

The only way to solve the mystery is to help solve your guests' problems by building new rides and coasters or beat challengers to your games.</resource>

    <resource id="e3829c411e3fa832fe02a7e6706343428fd82084" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">The game is played in third person where the player is presented by an avatar chosen from a roster of young adults as well as children, each with their own voice and personality. Navigating your avatar through each of the five themeparks, you will have to complete various tasks represented through an in-game menu split into six categories, such as building coaster rides, hiring publicity and looking at the visitors needs. The game features a robust sim-like economy within the park, where the player has to manage prices, fund the research for new rides and make sure there is enough power to around for all the stalls and rides. The rollercoaster editor is similar to that of the Roller Coaster Tycoon series, but all coasters have to start in assigned areas. Progression is made by completing missions that either requires you to build themepark rides, befriend visitors, root out robot invaders, bribe journalists, train personale and play lots &amp; lots of minigames. As each collectable found and mission completed, the player gains experience, called Thrill Points that will allow him to increase in level, and open new themeparks to buy and build up as he pleases. In addition to the single-player there is a separate multiplayer mini-game section, as well as Main Menu section dedicated to coasters that can be created and saved to be used in the game.

There is over fourty minigames to be played in this version of Thrillville, and Off the Rails adds the ability for rollercoasters to crash, adding more minigames, more options and expands the interaction between the player and the visitors.</resource>

    <resource id="64789cf6db01dc88f2f44e5180db34671135adad" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">This golfing simulation game is the 2007 multi-platform edition of Electronic Arts' Tiger Woods PGA Tour franchise.  Although the game's features differ across platforms, most notably from next-gen to current-gen, it has a few things in common across the board: more licensed players, more courses, more game modes, and improved GameFace character creation.

Tiger Woods PGA Tour 07 on Xbox 360 and PS3 feature more realistic characters thanks to the all-new Universal Capture (UCAP) technology. UCAP is the same technique that was used on The Matrix films to generate digital doubles for the lead actors. Another next-gen-only feature that the Xbox 360 and PS3 share is larger crowds and mass movement of spectators from hole-to-hole, as well as PIP cameras. There is also an enhanced career mode where you can master your skills in a new Practice Facility. The golfers have a new animation state engine that yields more pertinent emotions and reactions based on what happens in gameplay. The game setup has been changed, with different swing styles, and the Speed Golf setting which allows players to skip to the next shot after the ball has been struck without watching where the ball lands.

PS2 and Xbox versions of the game feature a new team tour mode where you can recruit your own squad of golfers to go up against Team Tiger Woods. The PC, PS2, and Xbox versions have the most licensed golfers (21) in the game. The Wii edition of the game features the ability to control your swing using the Wiimote.</resource>

With successful tournaments and accomplishments the player receives experience and skill points which are used to improve the character's abilities.

However, Bolt is not alone. She gets help from the Tokobots, a bunch a mechanized men who help Bolt out by forming certain objects such as bridges and ladders to avoid pitfalls and help move objects as well.

The gameplay is similar to Pikmin for the Gamecube, the player controls the Tokobots by highlighting them and sending them to certain areas and complete certain tasks.  The game will start you out with six, but as the levels progress, more Tokobots will be available, the more that can be obtained, the more bigger and powerful machines that can be used.  Likewise, the puzzles get harder as the game progresses as well.</resource>

    <resource id="df6888fba1133df9e134a5c83fa00bc924d604d5" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Lara Croft Tomb Raider: Anniversary is a remake of the original Tomb Raider with a technically more advanced graphics engine. It has the same basic storyline, though some cutscenes and much of the dialogue within have been expanded or modified in other ways. Locations correspond to those of the original version and are accessed in the same order, but have been re-designed with different layouts and mostly completely different puzzles which allow implementation of new moves introduced in Lara Croft Tomb Raider: Legend: swinging on ropes and using a grappling hook at specific points.

Puzzles are generally more focused on acrobatics in this version, ledges being much more prominently featured as a level design element, requiring combinations of jumping and shimmying across them to access areas. This type of gameplay replaces the key-retrieval and block-pushing puzzles of the original almost entirely. Combat is similar to that of the first game, though the player must now manually activate targeting. Some boss fights have been made a separate enclosed stage rather than being part of the exploration as in the original version. These fights may have puzzle-solving elements and often require the player to use Lara's new &amp;quot;adrenaline dodge&amp;quot; ability, which slightly slows down time when the opponent charges at her while in an &amp;quot;enraged&amp;quot; state. Some cutscenes require the player to participate in quick-time events.</resource>

It is up to you to prove that you can make the cut among the 200 other people varying for the coveted 8 spots. You are start out ranked 200th with various goals set for you throughout the city including the return of classic mode from the early Tony Hawk games. 

Chances to rank up come in various different ways now. There are spray painted lines located throughout the city to mark a type of goal. Weather it is grinding a certain distance, completing Natas spins, keeping your balance while doing a manual for a certain time and distance, point combos, and trick combos. Also players can obtain missions via random strangers located throughout the city.

Players can also earn Stokens by performing tricks to impress the locals that can be found wandering around the city. Players can use these Stokens to buy additional clothing, haircut styles, shoes, tricks, and boards from the store.

New to this game is the slow motion &amp;quot;Nail the Trick&amp;quot; mode where the focus is placed on the skater's feet and the movement of the board can be controlled with both of the analog sticks to build up a huge combo score!

The PSP version includes 14 multiplayer modes and 8 classic levels including Hawaii, Alcatraz and The Mall. The PS2, PS3 and Xbox version do not support online multiplayer.</resource>

The action is seen from a first-person cockpit view. Depending on the mission, different kinds of targets must be destroyed. There are always enemy aircraft, but some missions include sea and ground targets as well. Two weapons are available: machine guns (with unlimited ammunition) and missiles. The player can choose from three types of missiles before a mission: the more powerful ones can only be carried in lower quantities.</resource>

    <resource id="f224810585c814c3cd82d6abaf472e8cd539fc54" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is a game based on the movie of the same name. Set a few years after the defeat of Megatron in the first game/movie, Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen reveals that the threat from the Decepticons has in fact, far from ended. Since the end of the first movie Decepticons have began popping up again all over Earth. They are in search of a mysterious object from space that will gift the balance of power.

The game is a linear third-person shooter that puts the player in control of many of the main characters from the movie, shifting between both Autobot and Decepticon factions. The storyline is told via cutscenes that also allow for the player to easily transition from one character to the other. Playable characters on the Autobot side include: Optimus Prime, Iron Hide, Jetfire, Bumblebee. The Decepticon side includes: Starscream, Sideways (a new character), and Megatron.

Though the game doesnâ€™t allow transform wherever the player wants to, transformation has been introduced as special attacks during robot mode, as fixed alternate game modes (driving Shanghai tunnels as Sideways, and fly through the skies of Russia as Starscream) and, in both robot and vehicle modes, as special moves that give the player alternate abilities. For example, transforming as Starscream while flying will enable him to fly backwards as a robot to take out enemies behind the protagonist.

For multiplayer, at any point during a single-player campaign a friend can join in as a &amp;quot;Remote Weapon System&amp;quot;, which allows them to shoot enemies, erect a shield to defend and transfer energon between both players.</resource>

    <resource id="d43f22cc660a8f9caa87af697f04ea3ea51bcc45" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Transformers: The Game is the name of multiple versions of a video game based on the 2007 live action film Transformers, all of which were released in North America in June 2007. Home console and PC versions were developed by Traveller's Tales for the PlayStation 2, Xbox 360, Wii, PlayStation 3 and PC. A different PlayStation Portable version was developed by Savage Entertainment.

Transformers Autobots and Transformers Decepticons are the Nintendo DS versions of Transfomers: The Game. Vicarious Visions, who was tasked with bringing the adaptation to the Nintendo DS, chose to adapt the DS version into two separate games.[1] Autobots follows the heroes' perspective while Decepticons follows the villains'. Unlike games with multiple SKUs such as PokÃ©mon which feature only minor differences between versions, these are two separate games, sharing some basic similarities, but with unique characters, missions and locations.[2]</resource>

The town of Jalombe is under attack by such zombies, and she has been summoned to help exterminate them. Together with Father Richiardo at the monastery, she must find and destroy the source of the outbreak before Jalombe is destroyed.

Twin Blades is a scrolling action game where the player must slaughter waves of zombies as they spring up from the ground, using both a variety of different guns and a very large scythe. Killing zombies nets the player zombie hearts, which can be exchanged at the monastery for weapon and power upgrades, including new guns, more health, and even new moves. There are several types of zombies, some of which are resistant to certain attacks, and every so often a much larger, more difficult boss creature will appear.

The player can freely travel between open areas, and as stages are played, night will fall, which will cause zombie swarms on other stages to replenish and strengthen. In addition to the main story mode, there is also a survival mode where the player must survive 31 days against endless swarms of zombies.</resource>

In order to reproduce the original arcade games as closely as possible, the PSP can be rotated 90 degrees when playing those games replicated in their coin-op version. Twinbee da, originally made for the Gameboy, has had its graphics redrawn in full colour and to fit the high resolution of the PSP screen.

Euro 2008 lets you control any European national football team in many different ways. For example you can decide to create your own character and play as good as possible on your position on the field in order to become good enough to captain your team. This is basically a slightly modified version of the &amp;quot;be a pro&amp;quot;-mode from FIFA 08.

You can also try different challenges and tournament modes in order to unlock extras or just test your abilities. You can play through the full championship experience, including the qualifying stages, or you can skip ahead to the group stages. You can also play a very extensive challenge mode where you try to make you nation the best in European football by clearing different challenges against all the other European teams. 

As with FIFA 08 the PC and console versions are quite different. In fact, they are based on completely different game engines. While the Xbox 360 and Playstation 3-versions boasts state of the art graphics and a new and improved control system, the PC-version still basically looks and functions like the 2006-version.</resource>

Be the first player to get rid of all of your cards, but make sure to shout out &amp;quot;Uno!&amp;quot; when you have one card left, or you'll have to pick up another one!

Uno is a video game version of the card game of the same name.  Players take it in turns to play cards which skip players, force players to draw additional cards, reverse the flow of the game, and so on.  A card can only be placed on top of the pile if it is the same type of card, or if it is the same colour.  If neither of these conditions occur, the player must pick up another card.

There are three different modes of play in Gameloft's version of Uno:

Quick Play - Selecting this begins a game of Uno immediately.
Tournament - In this mode, you must beat your opponents in five rounds of Uno.
Custom Game - This mode lets you play Uno however you play it normally.  Many features are customizable, such as AI difficulty, scoring type, penalties, and how you draw additional cards.</resource>

Because there are no power-ups. 

Your enemies are all sea creatures, but some of them have grown legs and now they can attack and chase you on land.

One of the exceptional things about this game is its replay value, absent in most platformers: you can finish the game and then play against your best time, try to find hidden paths or exits, or even record your best replays on the memory card.

This edition is a re-release of the original Umihara Kawase: Shun, also for the Sony PlayStation, released back in 1997. In terms of new content, new levels have been added, as well as several bugfixes, but it is essentially the same game as the first edition.</resource>

The player tales the role of either Rick Ajax or Lori Machete, fighting through the wasteland known as Toxopolis. The primary aim is to reach the player's nemesis, The Maker. Each of the two characters has its own special abilities that are needed during the quest.

The story of the game is split into chapters, of which the most important feature final bosses. The in-game dialogues are triggered automatically and all of them are considered to be important to the main quest. Each chapter features an outro, except for the first one, which also features the intro of the game. Players will also be able to try out their skills in the Survival Mode which is available from the start and does not need unlocking.

The game is only available through the PlayStation Network by digital download.</resource>

The king ordered his men to slay the entire family of his loyal knight, Romulus, after Romulus questions the loyalty of the queen.

You play as one of three characters; the Knight Romulus, his younger brother Remus, or Sylvia, Remus' bride and daughter to the king.  As the three lay dying, they make a pact with an evil force, and return infused with unholy power, bent on revenge.

As they make their way to the king, players must convert foes into zombie slaves.

A rebel group of dissatisfied aristocrats and like-minded soldiers and citizens calling themselves the Gallian Revolutionary Army begins a civil war to wage an ethnic cleansing campaign against Gallians of Darcsen descent.[11] However, with the intense fight against the Empire having left Gallia's regular army in an exhausted state, there is initially little to stop the insurrection from gaining momentum. Laws preventing the formation of a national militia to fight fellow Gallians force the government to deploy military academy cadets to the front lines in order to combat and defeat the GRA forces.</resource>

The game features the main heroes, Joe, Capt. Blue and Silvia, along with many others as well as a group of villains fighting each other in a series of battles in multiple environments, such as a construction site, a warehouse and a wrestling ring to name a few.

The story has Captain Blue getting ready to shoot a new movie, but has trouble deciding who will be the lead character, so he sets up a tournament of the heroes to determine it. The player takes control of one of the three heroes, battling a set of enemies, each stage having their own set objectives to complete in order to advance. There is also a party mode that can support up to four-different players in an all out brawl. Players can collect &amp;quot;VFX Orbs&amp;quot; throughout the fight, collecting enough will allow the player to use a VFX power on the opponent(s).

The PSP port is virtually the same same, but with added content exclusive to it, a single player Trial Mode, where the player competes in a series of mini-games, the ability to play as Dante from the Devil May Cry series and a game sharing feature that lets players play wirelessly using Ad-Hoc and play certain stages using only one disc.</resource>

You create your own character and play to reach the number one rank on the world ranking list.

Virtua Tennis 3 is not a simulation like Top Spin 2 and only needs three buttons to perform all possible shot. Still time needs to be invested in training the character through several mini-games in which need you to hit a circle on the other side of the net or defeat aliens by hitting them with returns.

You can also play as one of the professionals against the CPU or a friend (or two if you play a Double). True to the series of the home version, there are also 12 mini-games available to play against your friends. These include the ones from the World Tour training as well as different ones like Curling or Super-Bingo. The Tournament Mode and Exhibition Mode are also present in the arcade version, but the Challenge Mode has been replaced by the World Tour Mode and Party Mode.</resource>

This game features vast improvements on the tag team action, including all new Hot-Tag, tag team finishers and new actions to help in the match.

As with the previous game the roster includes over 60 superstars from Smackdown, Raw and ECW. To keep the roster up-to-date, the game includes a roster editor allowing players to change the rosters superstars are on and change their alignment between face and heel. However, this is the first game in the Smackdown series since &amp;quot;Here Comes the Pain&amp;quot; not to feature any legends.

Another new feature is Create-a-Finisher, which allows players to create their own unique finishing move out of over 500 different animations. These can also be shared online during online matches.

This game includes two different story modes, i.e. Road to Wrestlemania and Career mode. Road to Wrestlemania mode allows you to play 6 unique stories involving Triple H, CM Punk, Chris Jericho, The Undertaker, John Cena and a co-op storyline featuring Batista and Rey Mysterio.

The Serpent King, Orochi, has made a rift in time and taken the most powerful warriors from the Sengoku period of Japan, and China's Three Kingdoms era for a showdown of the ages.

Battle the demon Orochi, and hack and slash his armies with a team of three warriors you can rotate between at any time.  Your two inactive teammates will recuperate during their downtime.  If your active character dies, however, you'll have to restart the mission or load a saved game.  A total of 79 playable characters from Dynasty Warriors 5, Samurai Warriors 2 and two new combatants are available to you.  The new Weapon Fusion technique allows you to combine a particular character's different weapons into a single stronger one.

Choose from four unrelated story campaigns, Shu, Wei, Wu, and Samurai Warriors Story, with different unlockable characters, weapons and items in each.  In the game's Free Mode, you can use any character in any stage you've already completed.

Play with a friend in two player split screen co-op.</resource>

    <resource id="47b2d528152d1bfc315d144eea8d89858b3618dc" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Based on the 1979 Paramount Pictures film of the same name and voiced by most of the original cast, The Warriors follows the career of a Coney Island street gang.  Starting months before the events of the film, The Warriors expand and defend their Coney Island turf, while proving that they are heavy enough players to join The Riffs’ network.  With a citywide rep, they can get invited to a major gang meeting where the future of New York street crime will be decided.  

The game follows the nine lead members of The Warriors (with flashback missions showing how they came to The Warriors): leader Cleon, Swan, Ajax, Cowboy, Cochise, Snow, Fox, Rembrandt, and Vermin.  During the game, the player will control each member, usually acting as a war chief and leading a squad of Warriors on a mission.  Missions vary from simply wrecking another crew to completing a series of objectives while avoiding arrest or worse. 

During missions, players can mug pedestrians, steal car radios, commit smash and grabs, tag walls or bomb other gangs’ burners, and load up on flash.  Between each story based mission, The Warriors return to their Coney Island hangout where they can train to improve their stats, go out on patrol, review their accomplishments, replay levels, or enter into a series of quick-play combat matches.  

The game plays like a squad-based brawler.  Each Warrior has his own fighting style and much of the game environment can be weaponized.  Fights are fast and often brutal, but stealth is also an option.  Players can perform stealthy finishing moves and distract police or other gang members with thrown bottles.  The game’s environments are fully 3D allowing Warriors to escape along the rooftops, hop over fences, or dash into shadowy areas.</resource>

Build a thriving natural ecosystem, a twisting, tunneling dungeon underneath the earth, and fill it with hordes of terrible monsters to protect the evil overlord, Badman. Ensure that he is safe from armies of nasty humans, eager to ransack the place, steal your loot, and prevent Badman from taking over the world!

Holy Invasion of Privacy, Badman! is a strategy game in the vein of the Bullfrog game, Dungeon Keeper. Players use their pickaxe to dig deep into the earth to protect the villain, Badman, from harm. Their goal is to create monsters by digging up nutrient-filled blocks, which produce monsters. The more nutrients inside the block, the more powerful the monster is. By creating all sorts of powerful monsters, you'll increase your 'Battle Power', which indicates how powerful Badman's entire army is.

Players only have a limited amount of 'Dig Power' available. After this runs out, they cannot dig through the earth any more, and must rely on the monsters to take care of the dungeon. More Dig Power can be earned for each level by not using all the Dig Power you were given, or by earning bonus Dig Power at the end of the level.</resource>

These events would shape history to come in the White Knight Chronicles saga, and White Knight Chronicles: Origins tells the story of the unsung heroes who lived through this period of unrest, only to be forgotten in the annals of time.</resource>

    <resource id="fc3b1db7748c97c05a484bc5383909ec78caa9f1" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Wild Arms XF is a handheld version of the console versions where once again the player is taken to the land Falgaia which is dying since a disastrous event.  Due to the limited resources, many nations of this world has gone to war over these resources, one of which is the kingdom of Elesius.  Elesius has begun to descend into chaos as the King has been struck down by a mysterious illness.  The senate has seized this opportunity to form their own military force to slowly take over the kingdom.  In the middle of this the player takes control of a Elesius knight named Clarissa Arwin as she is accompanied by her half-brother on the trail of the murderer of her mother and is swept up in the events of the descending chaos to help the royal family get back into power.

The gameplay is placed over a hex-based grid system allowing players to utilize different positions for a more tactical feel.  There are 60 different stages to travel along with the ability to create weapons and spells by combining rare items found throughout the quest.  There are also 20 unique classes to use from Berserker, Elementalist, Grappler, Geomancer and Sacred Slayer to name a few.</resource>

    <resource id="5dde82aac52220344c56140bf8cdd401e81ec986" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">WipEout Pulse is the second game in the WipEout series to be released on the PSP. Just like the other titles in the series, it is a futuristic racing games where players control a hovercraft-like vehicle that hovers above the ground and can reach very high speeds. The game is set in 2207 where players take part in the FX400 Anti-Gravity Racing League with courses all over the world.

The vehicles are divided over different teams (twelve including downloads), each with their own characteristics based on handling, speed, acceleration and more. While racing, moving over pads provides boosts or both offensive and defensive power-ups such as shields, rockets, a wall of fire, autopilot, a gun or a turbo boost. Instead of using weapons, they can now also be absorbed to restore the energy levels. A single button is used to accelerate, with regular steering and also air brakes for sharp corners. The visuals are very fast and the soundtrack consists of mostly electronic tracks, a hallmark of the series.

The base game consists of twelve tracks, but these can be driven in both directions (designated by black or white in the title name). New to the track design are waterfall-like drops, loops and corkscrews. At certain section the vehicle is glued to the track to pass these. Entirely new to the series is the revamped progression system. As usual, new tracks and faster models need to be unlocked by winning races, but instead of a linear model these are now grouped as hexagon-clustered grids with different modes of play. When available, players can choose any of the sections to participate in a time trial, single race, head-to-head, eliminator games (returning from Wipeout 3) and Zone games (introduced in WipEout Fusion) where the vehicle constantly accelerates and transforms into faster models until all health is depleted. A certain amount of races need to be won to access a new grid, but using this system some difficult races can be avoided or ignored. In all races the vehicles are destroyed when all energy is depleted. Based on the performance a bronze, silver or gold medal is awarded and there are three difficulty settings.

Using the vehicle of a certain team regularly is awarded with a loyalty system. The game supports game sharing and multiplayer modes using both Ad Hoc and Infrastructure as access. Up to 30 mp3 files can be loaded on a memory stick to use as the in-game soundtrack, there is photo mode to take screenshots during replays and on the game's official website players can design their own car skins using a flash client to use in the game. As with the previous games, there are many expansion packs that introduce new teams and tracks.</resource>

Players take part in a futuristic racing league known as the FX300 Racing League and control a fast hovercrafts on tight, cornering tracks, vying for first place in one of many tournaments. There are ten anti-gravity vehicles available to use (two need to be unlocked), each with their own characteristics in speed, handling and acceleration. Vehicles are further divided into classes that are unlocked gradually. In later classes most of the vehicles become much faster and require more precise steering at fast speeds. In the same vein, players can unlock new tournaments.

There are a total of sixteen tracks to race on: twelve designed from the ground up for the PSP, as well as four classic Wipeout tracks. Each track has its own obstacles, as well as weapon pick-ups (both offensive and defensive) and speed boosters. The different game modes include single races, tournaments of sets of races, time trial and zone races. In the zone races the player goes through a number of increasingly difficult zones on his own without the ability to slow down until the vehicle explodes because of collision damage. New game elements are unlocked through the Tournament mode.

The game features wireless play over ad-hoc mode (PSP-to-PSP). It was also the first PSP game to support downloadable content with extra teams, tracks and PSP skins. Some of these packs are only available for specific regional versions. The European version of the game supports game sharing.</resource>

The third game in the series was first released nine months later for the PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable, and Xbox 360. Reviews for the game were mediocre, receiving an overall score that was lower than its predecessors. GameSpot criticized it for not introducing newer elements as had been done with competing franchises.[4] A version for the Wii was then released in 2007, being developed by Point of View.[5] It is known that the title will allow players to utilize the motion-sensing functionality of the Wii Remote to play the game.</resource>

The stakes in World of Pool could not be higher. Go to another player's house and see what takes your fancy - a nice new cue, a jukebox, or even a vase. Challenge your opponent and if you win the item is yours for your very own crib. But be careful, because if you lose your own crib is going to be raided. As losing is not an option its time to play dirty - taunt your opponent to distract them, soften the cushions so the balls don't bounce - do whatever it takes to win.</resource>

The game marked Team17's return to its 2D roots.[2] The game spawned a sequel, Worms: Open Warfare 2, which is also available on Nintendo DS and PlayStation Portable.

In Worms: Open Warfare, the player takes control of an army of worms. The goal of the game is to defeat the opposing army through reducing the health points of enemy worms using various types of weaponry while avoiding friendly fire and other obstacles. The weapons and gadgets you use in battle include grenades, homing missiles, bazookas, cluster bombs, banana bombs (a Worms staple), dynamite, air strikes, shotguns, and many more. You can also choose from a variety of settings to battle in and make your own schemes and teams.
The game is played in rounds with each worm starting with 100 hit points. Each team takes turns controlling one of their worms. The player is usually allocated 60 seconds per turn to move their worm around the battlefield and attack the opponent worms, though this time limit is customisable when playing non-career games. Only one attack is allowed per turn.
In addition to timing individual player turns, each round has a 20-minute time limit. If the round timer runs down to 0:00 before a team claims victory, every worm's HP drops to 1, creating a sudden death scenario. During the course of a round, crates containing health or weapons will occasionally drop and the water level will rise.</resource>

It was developed by Team17 and Two Tribes, and published by THQ for the PlayStation Portable and Nintendo DS in 2007. It is the sequel to Worms: Open Warfare.

The gameplay of Open Warfare 2 is similar to that of previous games in the series. The game is viewed from a side-scrolling perspective. The player takes control of a team of several worms, and is pitted against other teams of worms under the control of AI (if in Singleplayer) or another Human (if in Multiplayer). Actions are performed in time-limited turns that cycle through each team. The winning team is that which can kill the opposing teams' worms; this can be achieved by using various types of weaponry and tools, availability of which depends on the game mode being played. Battles takes place on randomized, destructible terrain, which are visually distinguished by themes; &amp;quot;Forts&amp;quot; mode takes place on two forts, whose terrain depends on the theme. The player is able to select victory dances and color schemes for their worms, and to make custom race courses or fort maps using the level editor.

The PSP version allows players to select hats for their worms, while the DS version includes some exclusive minigames via the &amp;quot;Laboratory&amp;quot; mode. A demo of the game has been released by download for the PlayStation Portable, and for the Nintendo DS via DS Download Station Vol. 7.</resource>

It is the follow up to 2004's X-Men Legends. It was first released in September 2005 for the GameCube, Microsoft Windows, N-Gage, PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable and Xbox video game platforms. It is set after the events of X-Men Legends and features the mutant supervillain Apocalypse as the primary antagonist.

The developers intended the game to have a greater sense of scale than its predecessor, and writers created a story where the villains known as the Brotherhood of Mutants would need to ally themselves with the heroic X-Men to defeat a greater threat. High quality cinematics were created by Blur Studio. Online multiplayer was also added.

The game was well received by gaming critics on all platforms. Critics felt that the inclusion of online play, additional mutant powers, and a larger cast made the game an improvement over its predecessor. Some reviewers were critical of the game's voice acting and felt that the gameplay was repetitive. It sold enough copies to be added to the budget line known as PlayStation 2's Greatest Hits.</resource>

    <resource id="4968aebe957cfc397212067fb8e5adb7ac01495b" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Xiaolin Showdown is a game based on the animated series of the same name from Warner. It is a fighting game where you play as the four main characters of the show (Kimiko, Omi, Raimundo and Clay). Even if you play alone (the game supports 4 simultaneous players in story mode), the other 3 are present, controlled by the computer. You can also unlock 2 additional characters: Jack Spicer and Chase Young.

The players must defeat waves of enemy robots to collect Shen Gong Wu artifacts to increase their power and defeat series of enemies, until they are able to face Mala Mala Jong and put an end on the plans of the evil boy genius, Jack Spicer. Each Shen Gong Wu provides a new power, like locking nearby characters or punching the ground for area damage. Additional Shen Gong Wu can be bought using coins collected during the game.

The gameplay is inspired by party fighting games, like Power Stone and Super Smash Bros. You can chain combos with button combinations, jump and give flying kicks.

Between the game levels, there are showdowns, where the characters have to bet a Shen Gong Wu. The one that wins the challenge chooses a Shen Gong Wu from the player who lost. You can also only play the showdowns, instead the full story mode.</resource>

The classic adventuresome duo, Adol and Dogi, arrive in the harbor of Altago City, and quickly find themselves in a scuffle with the Dragon Knights, the kingdom's military police body, when attempting to save a local girl from harassment by one of their commanding officers. Upset by the interruption and subsequent humiliation, the commander arrests Adol and Dogi, charging them with espionage. 

The king of Altago, having known of the duo's pending arrival from an old trusted friend, quickly releases the pair from prison and summons them to his chambers. He tells the men about an ancient shrine that was uncovered after a recent earthquake, and asks for their help in investigating this mysterious new find. Adol and Dogi oblige, unaware that they are about to take the first steps on a long journey to save all of Altago from long-forgotten ancient forces, and to reunite the estranged five tribes who serve and protect the Five Great Dragons deified beings who may well be the world's last hope.

GX Tag Force is a card game, following the TCG rules (OCG in Japan) and based on the first season of the Yu-Gi-Oh! GX anime series. The player controls a young boy who enrolls at a foreign student at the Duel Academy.

The game is divided in three parts. In the first one the player has to team up with one of the famous characters from the anime. There are different conversation options and each Sunday a Tag Duel is held with one of the chosen partners. Affection needs to be built up through conversations and gifts until a partner has six hearts. Eventually the Tag Force Tournament at the end of July needs to be won and that is where the second part starts. A final partner is chosen and the characters much progress through duels to acquire 90 GX Medals and make it to the final round of the tournament. In the third part all Shadow Riders (Steven Stars in Japan) must be defeated that have brainwashed other characters.

The protagonist starts with a water deck and gains cards, which can be purchased from the store with DPs, as time goes by. After completing the game it an be restarted with another character to gain DPs. The duels are played from an almost top-down view with turn-based card desk battles.</resource>

    <resource id="0a6c737af5e16a55d023d6a53ccdb318d1de83e0" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Zendoku takes the concept of the puzzle game Sudoku and adds role playing elements to it.

The game replaces the numbers 1 to 9 with nine Martial Arts symbols like a panda or a dragon but the original rules remain in place. This means the player still needs to complete a column, row or 3x3 box were every symbol is only used once. The player can test his skills either in Classic Sudoku or in Zen-Mode where he needs to solve Sudoku puzzles under the pressure of time, but the core of the game is the Quest-Mode. 

At the beginning of the quest the player chooses from eight available characters. Four fight with weapons, four freehand but each one has a different quest, uses different fighting styles and has a different lucky symbol. Kingkage is for example a typical ninja. He uses the Ninjutsu-style, wants to be a legendary fighter and has the panda as his lucky symbol. Once a decision has been made. the player follows the story line of the chosen character on a 2D world map and when a fight occurs, the opponents play a round of Sudoku.

Every time one of the fighters completes a column, row or 3x3 box an attack is launched and obstacles appear on the opponents board while an attack icon travels along a rail towards the attacked. If he now correctly places his lucky symbol on the board, the attack will be reversed back his opponent. Placing a symbol incorrectly will make the player lose health and causes several cells on the opponent's grid to automatically fill in.

The game also features a multiplayer mode for two player in which they can either try to solve a puzzle together or play against each other in a battle.</resource>

Only the hero Absolute Victory Unlosing Ranger can defeat him...until he gets hit by a van. Before passing away, the hero passes on his Morph Belt to a random bystander, who must then become the Unlosing Ranger and face Darkdeath Evilman... Z.H.P. Unlosing Ranger VS Darkdeath Evilman is a roguelike tactical RPG featuring a single character rather than a party. The levels are accessed from a hub, the Hero Base, found on a planet on the other side of the sun, Bizarro Earth. Unlosing Ranger must face enemies by himself by moving around in each of the isometric dungeon maps. When the main character enters the enemies' Field of View Range, he gets noticed, and the enemy who has seen him will start following him around.</resource>

    <resource id="bcab6115c7b5accb56244699293b83b2508beac5" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">flOw is a PlayStation Network game, originally an online flash project by Jenova Chen and Nicholas Clark as a part of Chen's thesis research, but later adapted to a commercial game by thatgamecompany, which Chen co-founded.

The player controls a small, worm-like micro-organism on a bright, two-dimensional plane. On the PS3, it can be moved around by tilting the SIXAXIS controller in the direction the creature should swim. The PSP version is controlled with the analogue stick. There are six, gradually unlocked creatures to choose from (Snake, Jelly, Manta, Rogue, Hunter, Credit Creature), each with their own abilities such as poison, a swirling move to draw in plankton or a homing attack. The aim of the game is to eat other micro-organisms and evolve, moving deeper into the sea until the bottom is reached, leading the game to restart with a new creature. Evolving will change the creature's shape or grants new abilities. There are different power-ups, making the creature move faster or giving it a larger mouth. Certain larger enemies are made up of dots that need to be eaten to have it destroyed, requiring different strategies to take them out.

With each new level, moving deeper into the sea, the background, colours, enemies and music change. The creature is able to return to previous levels, or dive deeper, indicated by different icons. The game has straightforward controls and offers multiplayer sessions for up to 4 players, all using the same creature.

flOw applies the concept of dynamic difficulty adjustment. Players can choose to ignore large and dangerous enemies or come back to fight them later, striking a balance between the game's challenges and the individual abilities.</resource>

Sie erhalten Schaden, wenn Sie von einem Feind getroffen werden oder wenn Sie etwas Gefährliches berühren. Fleisch, das Sie auf dem Weg zum Power-Up-Bonk finden, können Sie in 2 Stufen futtern. Nachdem sich Bonk verwandelt hat, können Sie einen Kopfstoß auf den Boden geben, um eine mächtige Explosion auszulösen! Die Erde wird zittern und Ihre Feinde werden betäubt sein! Das ist die Macht von Bonk! Die Kraft seines mächtigen steinharten Kopfes! Das Spiel ist voll von Bonusspielen und versteckten Stufen!

    <resource id="ed06b83c04978ed4562684aebab0422b9f1feadc" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">First installation of the Burnout-series on handheld consoles combines the best features of the first three games: Burnout, Burnout 2: Point of Impact, and Burnout 3: Takedown.  Aggressive racing is still the centerpiece attraction of Burnout Legends and the player's task is not only to win the races but also crash opponent cars as much as possible.  Opponent takedowns, drifts, and other stunts award Burnout Points which in turn unlock new cars and other awards.

One player games can be played as single events or as a World Tour where the player needs to compete in different races and succeed in them in order to advance through five car classes (Compact, Muscle, Coupe, Sport, and Super).  In addition there is the Crash mode, where the goal is to create as much wreckage as possible by ploughing the player car into the traffic.  The different race types include Race, Time Attack, Road Rage, Pursuit, Face Off, Eliminator, Burning Lap, and Grand Prix.  Multiplayer game modes include Race, Road Rage, Pursuit, special Crash modes Double Impact and Party Crash (all these can can be played as single events or as a tournament), and Collector Challenge where the player has the opportunity to win other player's Collector cars.

PSP version game sharing feature allows others to play multiplayer events or single player demo without their own Burnout Legends UMD.

DS version Multi-Pak support allows two player games without additional game cards.  More than two player games require multiple game cards.</resource>

The different themes (called zones in the game) come with their own contraptions and a specific colour. Dangers include bombs, creatures, sinking surfaces, rotating blocks, blocks that blow the cube backwards and more. Sometimes these also need to be manipulated to create new paths (e.g. moving blocks and then luring a bomb to blow it up).</resource>

    <resource id="b3065595e00646dfa4f654336686bae4bccf1c55" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">FIA licensed Formula 1 racing game including the 2005 season teams, drivers, cars, and circuits.  The player controls the car on the track and tries to either complete a lap in fastest possible time, or race against either computer controlled drivers (or in multiplayer mode, against other players) and finish in top position.

Game can be played in Quick Grand Prix, Event, World Championship, and Multiplayer modes.  Quick Grand Prix selects a random car and circuit to race.  Event modes are Time Attack (race against ghost car), Single Grand Prix, and Scenario Mode in which the player needs to complete different kinds of racing tasks such as completing a lap with failed brakes and pitting in to fix them.  Each successfully completed scenario unlocks the next one.  Additional scenarios are available for download to PSP.

World Championship mode lets the player to choose the team to race in and the championship season difficulty.  All 19 circuits of the 2005 F1 season are raced in order and points for finishing in positions 1-8 are awarded.  Driver with most points at the end of the season wins the championship.  Before each race the player can drive practice laps to get familiar with the track and the car setup.  Player can also drive a single lap qualifying run which will determine the grid position at the race start.

The difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard) define the total number of laps, weather conditions, pit stops, and tyre wear.  Initially only the easy level is selectable and must be completed successfully in top three in order to unlock the medium level.  In same manner, the medium level must be completed in top three to unlock the hard level.  Also the Single Grand Prix Event is unlocked by successfully completing the easy level.

In Multiplayer mode, up to 8 players can play in three different race types.  As in singleplayer Time Attack, each car races against top time ghost car.  Both Head to Head and Single Grand Prix modes allow players to race a single grand prix, the difference being that in the latter mode, computer controlled AI drivers are entered to fill the grid if less than eight players enter.

F1 Grand Prix also includes a TV Mode Race where AI cars race each other and the player has no control, except selecting the camera view.

All 2005 season cars are initially available but the game has unlockable F1 cars from past years, such as Lotus-Climax 25, turbo powered Williams FW11, and Cosworth classics Lotus-Ford 79 and Williams FW08.  Overall game style is more arcade than simulation, eg. collisions do not cause any noticeable damage, after a spin-out the car is automatically pointed to the right direction, and driving off-track slows the car down.  A simple car setup system has three presets: Defensive, Balanced, and Aggressive.  Player can also enable Brake Assist which automatically applies brakes in corners if the speed is too high.</resource>

Like the previously re-released Final Fantasy it also has been built upon the Game Boy Advance version of the game. It has all bonuses from the Game Boy version including Soul of Rebirth, but also features new improved graphics, 16:9 screen format with easy to read texts and better quality of music and general sounds. The CG intro from the PlayStation version has also been redone in 16:9. It also includes art galleries of Yoshitaka Amano's illustrations.

There is an entirely new dungeon dubbed &amp;quot;Arcane Sanctuary&amp;quot;. The dungeon makes use of the &amp;quot;word memory system&amp;quot;, and depending on word selection there will be new enemies and unique dungeons. Also like in the GBA version there is a bestiary and an unlockable BGM music player. Other features do not change the GBA version much, even the difficulty is the same as in Dawn of Souls.</resource>

Opportunity abounds in a city emerging from the swamps, its growth fueled by the violent power struggle in a lucrative drug trade. Construction is everywhere as a shining metropolis rises from foundations of crime and betrayal.
As a soldier, Vic Vance has always protected his dysfunctional family, his country, and himself. One bad decision later and that job is about to get much harder. Kicked out onto the streets of a city torn between glamor and gluttony, Vic is faced with a stark choice: build an empire or be crushed.

    <resource id="75d994682d9c41dc8b2d2ef5bfdebb52bfffbd83" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Mostly based on the 2008 movie Iron Man, this videogame of the one-man-army hero has been released for seven different platforms.

The game of Iron Man puts you under the skin of Tony Stark. He is a billionaire weapon-industrialist and genius inventor who, after being kidnapped by terrorists who want to force him to build weapons for them, builds an armor instead to escape. Since then, he decided to stop producing weapons and keeps on working on the suit to fight them back.

The games take the story further, giving the player the chance to go through more than 12 different missions and even fight villains that do not appear on the movie, like Whiplash and Titanium Man. All this is shown through cinematics between every mission and use the voices of actors of the movie like Robert Downey Jr. and Terrence Howard.

By foot or by air, with the first armor at the beginning and in the characteristic red and gold suit later, using range weapons or melee attacks, the game features Stark fighting with armies of soldiers, tanks, helicopters, canons, etc. with the help of an array of upgradeable weapons like missiles, micro-grenades, repulsive shots, EMP blasts, a flame thrower and the powerful &amp;quot;Unibeam&amp;quot;. Both the weapons and the suit (propulsion and armor systems) are upgradeable, and there are many special armors from the comics to unlock in most of the versions.

Differences in this version from the Xbox360/PS3 version consist of altered visuals and altered upgrade system (rather than spending money on them, the player's gear is upgraded based on how much it has been used).</resource>

A young French girl from the village of Domremy trying to assist her father with his daily labors discovers a mysterious object: an armlet that binds magically on her wrist. Soon the village is being attacked and finding the first sword she can, she steps forth to encounter the enemy, some humanoid beasts. Taking strength from the armlet, hearing a mysterious voice and having for assistance her close friends, she manages to defeat them and embarks on a long quest to help her countrymen and vanquish the evil forces invading France.

Jeanne d'Arc is a turn-based strategy RPG game of the Japanese variety, that fuses medieval history with fantasy and the craziness of Japanese anime. This is a well known story retold through tactical battles one after another, while game dialog along with hand drawn cutscenes twist the story into different territories from the original. 

It is a story of teen friendship and dedication, remorseless war, evil magic, unavoidable death, heartache abandonment and purifying hope. Jeanne joins the army and along with 14 other companions with different skills and personalities march to face England's Henry VI's troops. With her are other armlet wielders, able to use them and transform into fearsome warriors able to strike down evil at its core. The game features a map to move through locations where the battles which push the story forward happen along with free stages that add nothing more than fun, strong items and difficult bosses.</resource>

Commanders guide a two-man team across multiple terrain types as they strive to build &amp;quot;command equity&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;local influence&amp;quot; through successful stealth and tactical operations. By rescuing civilians, completing goals, and uncovering bonus objectives, players will earn points to spend on weapons or military support in the form of supply drops and air strikes. Black market equipment and intelligence can also be acquired from the local populace, improving the SEAL team's chances for success.

An entry in the SOCOM series wouldn't be complete without multiplayer options, and Fireteam Bravo 2 includes wireless support for up to 16 players in both Ad-hoc and Infrastructure modes. Three new game types are introduced in this sequel, including a capture-the-flag variant, and users are now able to create custom tournaments, ladders, and even clan challenges. Fireteam Bravo 2 also offers an improved friends list and instant messaging to help simplify the process of finding worthy teammates and opponents. As in the first PSP title, Fireteam Bravo 2 lets owners of the PS2 version link the two games to unlock special features in both SOCOM titles.</resource>

However, he is resurrected by Homunculus (voiced by Charles Martinet in English), a djinn or genie, who offers to send him back in time to prevent his death and gives him the time-traveling digipad. Eike explores four erasâ€”2001, 1980, 1902 and 1580â€”as he attempts to unmask his killer and figure out a way of stopping his own murder at various points in the present. Along the way he encounters several characters: Dana, a modern-day waitress whom he accidentally brings back to the year 1580 and loses; the present-day fortune teller, who tells Eike the hour of his death; Eckart Brum, the curator of a private art museum who lost his wife and infant daughter in a shooting; Dr. Wolfgang Wagner, an alchemist living in 1580 with his wife, Helena, and their two children, Hugo and Margarette; and Alfred Brum, the great-grandfather of Eckart.

Given a red stone by Dana, Eike follows the Homunculus' instructions to give the stone to Wagner. Time-traveling ten days later, Eike discovers that the result of Wagner's experiment destroyed the lab and caused Hugo, already upset by his mother's death due to a lingering illness, to build a time machine and track Eike down with the intent of killing him. Depending on the player's actions, Hugo holds either Margarette or Dana hostage in the present and plans to use the red stone, revealed to be the Philosopher's stone, to resurrect his mother.</resource>

    <resource id="48e7f23dae56c270dc869a591d7781fff4b6cfb1" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">FIA licensed World Rally Championship game including the 2005 season teams, drivers, cars, and rally locations. The player controls the car on the track and tries to complete the stages in fastest possible time.  Since rally is driven so that the track is clear of other cars, competitors are shown as ghost cars.  Co-drivers notes are both spoken and shown on the screen to aid in navigating the often twisty stages.

Game can be played in Quick Rally, Time Trial, Single Rally, Championship, and Multiplayer modes. Quick Rally selects a random car and rally stage to race.  In Time Trial, a ghost car is shown on the track and the player's goal is to beat its time on that stage.  In Single Rally mode, player chooses the team and car to drive with and needs to complete all the stages in a single rally.  Other drivers are shown as ghost cars.

Championship mode extends the Single Rally mode into full season of 16 rallies.  Each rally has two to four stages and the player must reach certain position in order to advance to the next stage.  Difficulty level (novice, professional, expert, extreme) defines the number of stages per rally and the required finishing position.  Expert and extreme levels are unlocked by completing the preceding level.  After each rally, points are awarded to top 8 drivers and the championship is won by most points at the end of the season.  Completing championship modes also unlocks new car types and rally stages for other play modes.

Multiplayer modes include both offline (hot-seat) and online play.  The hot-seat rallies are for up to four players and allow the players to compete in Time Trial, Single Rally, and Championship modes.  Online wireless play allows up to eight players to race together on a single stage.  As in other modes, competitors are shown as ghost cars.

The game has an arcade-style control scheme (no manual gear changes for example) and a simple damage model.  Damaging the car has visual impact on the car and on expert and extreme levels, damage affects the car performance too.  PSP WRC supports downloadable content, like custom avatars for the player.</resource>
