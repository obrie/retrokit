    <resource id="8c08610ba06730f9dd04f96bf50744007c2bf786" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">This game is very similar to Space Invaders. The player controls a gun turret at the bottom of the screen. The turret can move both left and right and is able to shoot missiles. These missiles are used to shoot down the alien invaders which are moving back and forth in rows dropping missiles toward the player's gun turret. Each alien defeated earns the player points toward their score. Every once in a while, a spaceship will fly across the top of the screen and shooting it will give the player extra points. The goal of the game is to clear the screen of Alien Invaders and score as many points as possible. The game ends when the player loses all three of their lives.

There are 10 game options that can be chosen with different number of players, player missiles and alien missiles. Players can also take turns or play simultaneously.</resource>

The player's bowling ball starts out moving back and forth across the front of the lane. This has the player trying to get the lane position they want the ball to start traveling down. Once the ball starts rolling down the lane, the player can curve the ball left or right. Once the curve has started, it can't be changed further.

The game contains 18 game variations. They involve choosing the combination of number of players (1 or 2 players), playing either a regular or split game, and then choosing the speed of play (slow,normal,fast, and fastest).

The regular game, just like it sounds like, is a regular game of bowling featuring the usual rules of play.

The split game has each frame starting  with some combination of less than 10 pins. The player has 2 balls to knock down the remaining pins in each frame.</resource>

Players control the 12 checkers at the bottom of the screen and attempt to remove the 12 checkers at the top of the screen which are controlled by a computer opponent. Players can only move their checkers diagonally toward their opponents side of the board. A checker can be jumped when two opposing checkers are next to each other and there is an empty space on the diagonal of the checker getting jumped. If a checker is put into a position of being able to be jumped it must be jumped. If a checker happens to reach the other side of the board, that checker is kinged and is allowed to move both back and forth in diagonal movements. The game is won by the player who removes all their opponents checkers from the board.</resource>

Desert Fox. In this game you control one of two tanks engaged in a battle. The goal is to earn as many points as possible by shooting your opponent. On the game screen there are two barriers and five mines. The tanks can not shoot through the barriers or mines making them ideal for cover. The tanks can drive through the barriers, but attempting to drive through a mine will cause your tank to explode awarding your opponent a point.

Shooting Gallery. In this game you control a rifle on the left side of the screen and need to hit a target on the right side of the screen. The goal is to earn as many points as possible by hitting the target with as few misses as possible. You can play with no time limit at an average speed, or increase the challenge by adding a time limit and increasing the game speed. This game can also be played by two players to see who can score the most hits.</resource>

The player is trapped inside a playfield and has to dodge a ball that continuously keeps bouncing of the sides of the playfield. The longer the player is able to dodge the ball, the more points are earned. After a certain amount of points are earned, another ball enters the playfield thus making the player have to dodge two balls. More balls keep getting added at fixed intervals after that until a total of 9 balls enter the playfield. The game ends when the player is finally hit by the ball.

In the 2 player game, both players are put into the same playfield and try to outlast the other player in not trying to get hit by the balls being thrown by the computer.

The game features random variations in the gameplay, such as having different sized playfields, ball sizes and speeds, and changing the players size and speed.

The game features four different modes which are either a 1 or 2 player Amateur mode or a 1 or 2 player Pro mode.</resource>

In Galactic Space Wars, players take control of a fighter spacecraft to find and destroy enemy spacecrafts. Players take a first person perspective from inside the cockpit of the spacecraft to search the vast area of space. Once an enemy craft is located, players try to quickly scroll the ship into their lasers sight. If the enemy stays on the screen too long, it will fire at the player's ship. The player has a limited amount of time to destroy as many ships as possible and not get hit.

Lunar Lander seems to have been inspired by the same titled arcade game. Players pilot a lunar lander and attempt to have a soft landing. The lander only has a certain amount of fuel to maneuver around with thus adding to the challenge. The key is to gently and smoothly lower the lander onto the platform, as coming down too fast or missing the platform crashes the lunar lander. The objective is to land the craft in the least amount of time possible.</resource>

Once all the man's body parts are drawn from several incorrect guesses, he is hanged and the player loses.

Variations include having the computer come up with a word, have a player come up with a word for another player to solve, giving the player one of the letters in the word to help them get started, telling the player the letter belongs to the word but not where, not tolling how long the word is, having the player guess the correct letter and place it where it belongs in a word, and a variation where the player has to solve an anagram.</resource>

Mind Reader is a numerical version of the popular combination guessing game Master Mind. The console chooses a random number and the player is given 20 chances to guess it. After every guess, the display shows how many numbers were correctly placed, and how many numbers are correct but in the wrong spot. Every wrong guess increases the computer's score, and finding the code increases the player's score. The game can be played with a time limit instead of a limited number of guesses.

Nim is a single-player adaptation of a traditional 2-player number game. Depending on the options, there are some piles on screen with a certain number of elements. The player and the console take turns at removing arbitrary numbers of elements from the piles. They have to remove at least 1 element and only from one pile in any turn. The side that gets to remove the last element wins the round. The game can also be played with a time limit.</resource>

The game presents a series of problems to solve; using the controller you need enter in the correct answer. A correct answer earns a point; if you enter an incorrect answer you are then given a second chance. Answer incorrectly a second time and then a point is given to the computer which will also show you how to solve the problem. These are the only variations featured within the game itself, however the instruction manual includes a variety of suggestions for games that can be played by two or more players. These include Mathematical Chairs (two players take turns seeing who can answer the most problems in a row), Math Maze (the manual features a maze drawn on a grid; answer a question correctly and you can move that many spaces), Hang Math (a variation of hang man), Up to 1000 (answer problems correctly to add the value to your score; try to end up with 1000 points without going over), and several more.</resource>

Once again, the game presents the player with a series of problems, simple multiplications in the first game variation, and simple divisions in the second. The results have to be entered using the controller. If the answer is correct, a point will be added to the left counter. After entering a wrong answer, the player gets another chance to correct the result. If it is wrong again, the right counter will be increased, counting the mistakes made so far.</resource>

This game contains a few variations:  A straight maze run, a jailbreak maze (break through each square), an invisible maze, and a hidden maze (eat your way through I guess).  In all the variations you can choose between 1-4 speeds and/or throw the cat in the maze for an extra challenge.</resource>

If the cards match, they disappear from the playfield. If they don't match, the cards are flipped back over face down again and the player tries again. The better the player is at memorizing where the overturned cards were, the easier it will be for them to find a match.

The game contains 4 variations of its basic premise. The Memory Match 1 variations offer a smaller grid thus making it an easier mode for the player(s).

Memory Match 1:
Cipher-24 (6x4 grid with numbers) 
Symbol-24 (6x4 grid with symbols)

Memory Match 2:
Super Cipher-40 (10x4 grid with numbers)
Super symbol-40 (10x4 grid with symbols) 

The game offers both a 1 player and 2 player mode. In the 1 player game, the player tries to clear the board in the fewest amount of guesses. In the 2 player game, both players try to get more matches than their opponent.</resource>

The basic gameplay features the player bouncing a ball off of a paddle into a wall of bricks, chipping them off one brick at a time. Each brick destroyed earns the player points depending on its color. Once the ball bounces off the wall of bricks, its up to the player to maneuver the paddle under the falling ball in order to hit it back up into the wall of bricks. 


The player loses a life if they miss a ball with their paddle and the ball falls into the abyss. The game ends when the player loses 7 balls. To keep up with the pinball motif, the wall of bricks are referred to as different colored skill lanes, the walls on the side as side rails, and the paddle as a flipper. The game offers 132 variations of this gameplay idea, including variations with different sized paddles, ball speeds, invisible bricks, and even one where the paddle shrinks when the ball is hit.</resource>

In this early chess simulation you can only play against the machine, as there is no multiplayer support. The player can chose either the white (actually green on screen) or black (actually red) pieces, and can select from 4 different AI difficulties. The easiest AI plays its turns in a matter of seconds but, as the difficulty increases, each turn can take several minutes. In the highest difficulty, the AI can take up to 50(!) minutes to decide its move. To allow the player to watch something else on the TV while the system is busy, the game cart has a very special feature: an integrated red led lights up while the machine is &amp;quot;thinking&amp;quot;.</resource>

The game offers two modes. Random Play mode lets the wheel spin and then stop randomly and the Select Play mode lets the player stop each wheel one at a time when it's spinning.</resource>

Instead of trying to randomly guess what grid an opponent's battleship is on, after the player takes a shot, the player will hear a  sonar ping noise. The shorter the noise, the closer the player is to hitting a target.

In the 1 player game, the player has a limited number of chances to sink the enemy fleet of ships, while in the 2 player game,  players take turns trying to sink their opponents ships before  having their own ships sunk.</resource>

The goal is to destroy your opponents ship by depleting its energy supply; success will earn you a point. Each ship is capable of flying anywhere on the screen and is also equipped with lasers for attacking your opponent. At the beginning of the game each spaceship has 90 energy units; when no energy is left that  ship will be destroyed. Energy can be depleted in two ways: 2 points are used up every time you fire your lasers, and 5 points are lost if hit by enemy laser fire. Should your energy level drop to 10 points or less, you will be unable to fire your lasers; this prevents you from accidentally obliterating your own spaceship! Energy units can be replenished by flying through one of the two starbases located at opposite ends of the screen.</resource>

This is an aerial dogfighting game that pits the Red Baron against the Blue Max. The goal is to try to shoot down your opponent to score a point, and the player with the most points wins. Viewed from the side, your bi-planes have the freedom to fly anywhere on the screen; the screen wraps, so if you fly off of one side you will appear again on the other side. You can also hide just off screen to attempt to sneak up on an opponent; be careful, even though you may not be visible you are still vulnerable to attacks! The game can be played by two players against each other, or one player against the computer. When playing against the computer, the computer's skill level will vary throughout the game; the more times you are successful in shooting down the computer, the more its skill level will increase! However the more the computer shoots you down, the more its skill level will decrease.</resource>

Tic-Tac-Toe. A computerized version of the popular game. You play the X's and the computer the O's; taking turns your goal is the place three X's on the 3x3 grid before the computer. You always get to move first.

Shooting Gallery. In this game, for 1 or 2 players, you control a rifle and need to hit a target on the other side of the screen. The goal is to hit the target with as few misses as possible. You can play with or without a time limit and at different speeds.

Doodle. This is a drawing program. Using the controller you can draw any picture you like on the screen. There are five different line sizes and three available colors.

Quadra-Doodle. Here the computer will draw random patterns influenced by the player, such as changing the colors used and the size of the lines. You can switch back and forth between Quadra-Doodle and Doodle, allowing you to draw on top of the generated image or the computer to draw on top of yours.</resource>

To protect their goal, the player's paddle can fire missiles which can be aimed straight or angled. Missiles that hit whizballs can help propel in an opposite direction. If one of the missiles (or the whizballs) hit the player's or an opponent's paddle, they will temporarily disappear leaving their goal undefended. The game is won when one of the players gets to a selected score.

The game contains 72 game variations of this basic premise, including having from 1 to 4 whizballs and 6 different game types. Game types are Basic where each whizball is worth 1 point, Basic Plus where players can guide the missile shots, Bonus where whizballs are worth 1 to 4 points each, Bonus Plus which adds guided missiles to the Bonus mode, Super Bonus where whizballs increase in value the longer they stay in play, and Super Bonus Plus which adds guided missile shots to the Super Bonus mode.</resource>

Players take turn rolling dice and then moving their pieces around the game board.  Blue &amp; Red each have to move all their pieces off the board to win, and are competing against each other and against lady luck herself.  

Acey-Deucey is another way to play Backgammon where the starting position is different.  Instead of starting the game with numerous pieces arranged at places around the board, you start with all your pieces at the starting line.  It makes for a longer game, although just as strategic and challenging.</resource>

One player takes to the field, the other grabs a bat and steps up to the plate.  The pitcher can throw fast, slow, and some wicked curves even at the last moment.  Luckily the single-button swing action makes hitting the ball fairly easy, even if getting a single is harder than hitting a double or home-run.</resource>

The game follows the typical blackjack rules; your goal is to get cards totaling as close to 21 as possible without going over.

The game features a full 52 card deck, and the computer will automatically shuffle the deck if there are less than 16 cards left; optionally you can request the computer reshuffle the deck at any time. One or two players can play, each player beginning the game with $500. There is a minimum bet of $1 and a maximum bet of $99. In the two player game a player who has gone broke may optionally borrow $100 from the house to re-enter the game.</resource>
