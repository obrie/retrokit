    <resource id="9734a882e3b87f040d4a80c2baced95c5f1ecf72" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past &amp; Four Swords for Game Boy Advance is a remake of A Link to the Past coupled with an entirely new game, Four Swords. This two-in-one game was released shortly before The Wind Waker.

While A Link to the Past is largely a faithful port of the original, it does include an entirely new dungeon and a new quest as rewards for the player playing through the multiplayer-only Four Swords. Aside from these additions, it includes a number of smaller gameplay and dialogue changes, the latter of which are designed to correct a number of minor translation mistakes and inconsistencies with the original Japanese release and to unify the common terms used with the later games.</resource>

    <resource id="a0ae1351750d81548d3a818ebfff086be61e37ef" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Based on the movie (and first three books of the series), Lemony Snicket's a Series of Unfortunate Events for Game Boy Advance puts players in the unfortunate shoes of the incredibly unlucky Baudelaire orphans: Violet, Klaus, and Sunny.

Each orphan has an unusual talent that will let them progress through three chapters (each with over a dozen levels). Though the game looks like a traditional side-scroller, combat takes a backseat to clever puzzle-solving and adventure game elements. The three orphans must use their talents, along with items found in the world, and various interactions to escape each level and avoid the evil Count Olaf and his elaborate plans to inherit the children's fortune.

Inventions also take a big role in this game, and players will have to assemble them from common household objects. For example, in one level, Violet will be hunting for ice cream scoopers, soup cans, and a crank to invent an &amp;quot;apple chucker&amp;quot; which can help defeat Count Olaf's friends.

The game offers quite a bit of replayability, too, with quest points and exotic books earned for discovering all the game's quirky secrets.</resource>

At the start of each mission, you'll have to give Rocket enough power to blast off by tapping the action button to the beat of the music. After that, there are six ways to play - one section has you in control of Rocket as you steer him through an obstacle course, and another asks you to listen to the music for what you need to find. There are also two difficulties - Easy and Hard - which affect not only the buttons you need to press in certain situations, but also require you to do a little extra work to fulfill your objective.</resource>

    <resource id="3fd492e4ff2150feab40e5f1b80774f87b055c0d" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Three Vikings, Eric the Swift, Olaf the Stout and Baleog the Fierce, were kidnapped by the alien Tomator, the evil Croutonian ruler, who is collecting unique life forms to display in his gallery. The three Vikings will have to combine their unique skills to defeat Tomator, as well as a vast array of aliens, robots, giant snails, big lizards and more.

The Lost Vikings is a side-scrolling platform puzzle game with a twist. Instead of one character who can jump, run, shoot, collect items, flip switches and so on, there are three different characters, each with his own skills. Eric the Swift can jump, run and bash through walls with his tough helmet. Olaf the Stout has a shield which can block attacks, function as an air glider or as a step to stand on. Baleog the Fierce can shoot things with his arrows (including switches) or kill things with his sword. The player has to use the three Vikings as a team if he wants to get past the increasingly difficult levels and puzzles.

The player controls one Viking at a time, but can switch between them at any point. The Vikings have limited space in their inventory which they can use to keep various items. Each Viking has three health points, and if he loses them all from confrontations with dangers, he dies (some threats kill instantly), and the level must be restarted.</resource>

One of motocross racing in which players have the standard practice/single race/season options with ongoing success unlocking more tracks and bikes. The other mode is a stunt-based motocross practice/competition mode where riders try to do as many crazy tricks in a crowd filled arena as possible within a particular amount of time. The game has a unique feature in that the bike has a controllable clutch (even for automatic gears) which must be mastered to succeed at the game. Correct use of the clutch when landing jumps of traversing troublesome terrain allows the rider's speed to be kept at a maximum. This must be used in conjunction with the &amp;quot;Prime Jump&amp;quot; button which must be held before a jump or bump to fly through the air.</resource>

Like in the movie, the penguins want out of the New York zoo. As the game opens, the crack team of penguin escapees has put the finishing details on their escape plan, which involved digging a tunnel under the zoo and all the way to Antarctica. Of course, this isn't as easy as it sounds, and the penguins will need a number of supplies, items, and help. And along the way, they also intercept a group of four lost animals on their way to the island of Madagascar. Gamers take control of Private Penguin, who is assigned a number of missions to accomplish. He begins with a few standard attack and jumping moves, but as the game progresses, he will learn more powerful attacks and abilities like sliding. He will also find several useful gadgets to defeat enemies with. The four main characters from the movie show up at times, as well. While gamers of all ages will enjoy the crazy penguin antics, the difficulty of the game is aimed at younger gamers.

    <resource id="2fb4c4bc1493421137230b46283868d4b354357b" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Based on the documentary March of the Penguins, this game follows the story of the emperor penguins as they embark on a long journey to breed their young. The game has been divided into twelve chapters, with different gameplay. The penguins need to be navigated through the environment, find a suitable mate, find food, take care of the egg, guard the young ones and finally make it all the way back.

A large part of the game is based on the concept of Lemmings. As the penguins march on, players need to help them land softly, melt obstacles, attract them in a certain direction using fish and place trampolines, ramps, slides, bridges and steps to make them access new areas. The levels can be explored using binoculars and the penguins need to collect a certain amount of snowflakes to pass. The penguins cannot die. When they fall off a cliff, they simply restart at the beginning of the level, but the players needs to bring them to the end as a group to succeed.

Other levels have the penguins slide down hills with faster gameplay, feature mazes, or take place underwater where predators need to be avoided while collecting food. In the later parts of the game, guarding the eggs adds an new layer of difficulty. As soon as a penguin hits an obstacle it is dropped. There is little time to pick it up again or it freezes. It also need to be taken to a warm spot before the thermometer time runs out.

Some educational content has also been included. Next to the habits, more information about the penguin migration in provided in between levels.</resource>

It's not a big business, but their reputation is steadily going up. One day, their past teacher Ingrid requests them to write books for the new library that is being built. The library will be finished in 5 years, so they are requested to write at least one book every year during that time. During the years, Marie and Elie are introduced to Anis Ryftchen, a young alchemist studying to become a teacher. While Anis initially seems cheerful, it's soon revealed that she is overworking herself. Anis is struggling to keep up with both her work at the academy and her vision to write books for her school back in the Southern Country. Marie and Elie offers to help her, but this is ultimately up to the player to choose.</resource>

    <resource id="384ee72a2d337455dc95c727878426186728af83" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">The first portable incarnation of the Mario Party series, Mario Party Advance shakes things up quite a bit on the GBA.  With the focus on the single-player, there are all kinds of single-player mini-games, one giant single-player board to traverse instead of multiple ones (Shroom City), and all kinds of different Gaddgets and gameplay modes to indulge in.

The main single-player experience involves traveling across &amp;quot;Shroom City,&amp;quot; which is a major departure from the standard set-up in past Mario Party titles.  You have the choice to be Mario, Luigi, Peach, or Yoshi, and depending on who you choose, you'll start at a different spot on the board, which is quite large.

You're given die rolls to navigate the board and, when you reach special sections of the map, complete special quests, which often involve helping residents of Shroom City and/or participating in special challenges.  Most quests involve collecting some sort of object elsewhere or a mini-game.  By completing these quests, you'll collect stars, which eventually allow for special boss bouts with Bowser, and you'll unlock mini-games and Gaddgets, which are simple, toy-like contraptions that you can play with.

The game ends when you complete your allotted number of turns, although additional turns and die rolls can be earned during the game by completing the &amp;quot;Mushroom Challenges&amp;quot; that occur rather often.  After completing your session, your rewards are saved, and you can play with your mini-games and Gaddgets in Play Mode.

There are also two additional modes available, &amp;quot;Party Land,&amp;quot; where you can play special duel mini-games with a friend, and &amp;quot;Challenge Land,&amp;quot; where you play through special modes that test your mini-game skills to earn coins, which can be used to purchase additional unlockables in a shop.

Finally, there is also a feature called the &amp;quot;Bonus Board.&amp;quot;  You can play with a board that is included with the game using the GBA.  The GBA takes care of die rolls, mini-games, and end-of-the-game events.</resource>

Selectable playable characters are: Spider-Man, Blade, Elektra, Thor, Wolverine, Captain America, Deadpool and Iceman. Ms. Marvel and Thing as also available as unlockable characters.

The game plays out something like Final Fight, where the player walks from left to right with the ability to move on the z-axis and punch and kick wave after wave of enemies including the occasional boss.

It has some unique elements added to the genre basics, however.  A meter controls the use of super powers, which can be upgraded as experience is gained. Players also have the ability to summon various Marvel heroes for quick support roles.  There are many items to find, both quest items, such as keys to unlock doors and weapons and equipment, like weapons and armor, to buff up the characters' abilties.</resource>

In the lore of the original PC hit, Max Payne on the Game Boy Advance follows Max's story as he attempts to take down the crime lords who tried to destroy his life.

Unlike the original, the GBA version uses an isometric perspective to present the action. Various weapons are offered to dispatch the guys (or girls) who get in your way, and by using bullet time, you can slow down time and increase your chances of avoiding incoming fire and hitting the target.</resource>

    <resource id="65dd33a080b0b4ec31770a1f1c1489c7fa409943" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">The ancient gods have passed judgment, and as a result all of mankind has been sentenced to be replaced with a new, less sinful race. The only chance for redemption lies withing a magical item that will allow mankind to atone for its sins. But the item in question has been stolen by the enemies of humanity, and the verdict of the gods will soon come to pass.

Mazes of Fate is a fantasy medieval first person &amp;quot;dungeon-crawler&amp;quot; RPG in which you create a character based on gender, class and attributes (or take your pick from one of the three pre-made characters) and set out in a quest to save the human race from oblivion. The game alternates between world and town map sequences in which you control your party from an overhead perspective and visit shops and get quests from NPCs and the many dungeons that compose the bulk of the game itself. While dungeon crawling the game switches to a first-person perspective from which you control your party as it fights all the monsters that cross your path and loot the treasures uncovered. Combat is real-time although the game pauses while you navigate action menus.

Features loads of items, weapons and quests, as well as tons of monsters and up to 5 recruit-able party members.</resource>

Take control of your favorite character and face off against many opponents as you make your way to the head of the GP to reach the ultimate prize, an incredibly rare battle chip!

Gameplay is based around the Mega Man Battle Network series of games, in that players purchase and use various battle chips to combat their opponents.  However, unlike the main games, players do not have direct control over their Net Navi.  Instead, players pre-select their battle chips, and one of these chips are used in the battle against the opponent.  Once selected, the game automatically plays out the battle.

There is also a process called 'slotting in', which can be performed by pressing L or R during battle when your slot in gauge is full.  Slotting in allows you to use an additional battle chip during gameplay to assist you.  If successful, the chip will be used, and aid you with healing, dealing extra damage, and so on.</resource>

The legendary heroes of the Reploids, X and Zero, defeated the evil Sigma long ago, and a new army was created to prevent outbreaks of the Maverick Virus. But as time went on, the army became oppressive, and began to deal out a paranoid brand of justice. It is said that their leader, once a great warrior, has become cold and calculating, eliminating any Reploid that dares oppose him.

A hero is needed in these dark times, and that is exactly what Ciel and her rebel group have found in an old ruin...a hero from the past, reborn in the future.

Zero has come into a time he does not know, to save it from a figure of the past...the fate of freedom rests on his shoulders.</resource>

Caught in-between the reploids and humans, Neo Arcadia's new commander has tricked Zero into helping her, although her reasons are uncertain.

To fix the problem, Zero must battle through level after level, using the new Chain Rod weapon to grapple onto ledges to gain an advantage in collecting out of reach items or attacking enemies from above. Cyber Elfs can again be collected to gain some helpful powerups.

New to the series is a two player challenge mode, where the first to complete the level wins.</resource>

Continuing where the Mega Man Zero 2 left off, you have to find and neutralize the recently escaped &amp;quot;Dark Elf,&amp;quot; before it's able to brainwash the Resistance for the purpose of conquering Neo Arcadia. 

In addition to the old Cyber Elf system, this game also contains a new &amp;quot;chip&amp;quot; system, where Zero can gain new abilities by finding chips and installing chip in himself. But they didn't decide to abandon the Cyber Elves in this game by giving them nothing new. No, in order to extend the life of the Cyber Elves, they added the new concept of &amp;quot;Cyber Space&amp;quot; to levels, where you enter a door to Cyber Space and are allowed to use each Cyber Elf as much as you please without them dying. However, there aren't too many &amp;quot;Secret Disks&amp;quot; (items that can contain anything from profiles of characters to Cyber Elves to new chips) in Cyber Space, so it's better to spend more time in the normal level.</resource>

The main game story kicks off with Conan, Ran and Kogorou on their way to ceremony of a newly built resort by the sea. Kogorou Mouri, as a renowned detective (thanks to Conan), was invited to the opening ceremony, while Conan and Ran are just tagging along. As they arrive, the owner of the luxury resort asks them to look into the rumors about the land where the mansion was built on. The rumor is known as the so called &amp;quot;village of suicides&amp;quot;. Later that evening, as they check the buffet and meet many other invited guests, pleasantries are exchanged and small talks reveal little to nothing of interest... until, a body falls down on a sports car that was on the display in the lobby area. Coincidence, or is there really some truth to these rumors... Conan is taking up to find out the truth and discover the mystery behind this death as well as the rumors that are plaguing the area.</resource>

The game is open-ended and non-linear, with the player given the freedom to decide where to go and what missions to do in whichever order. The player can choose the character classes, such as a mechanic or soldier, for the player characters. The battles are turn-based, with the characters able to fight either on foot or using tanks. The tanks can be created and customized by the player, who can modify and enhance each part of a vehicle, though there is a weight limit to each tank. In certain areas where tanks cannot pass, the characters must engage the enemies on foot. The game also features gambling machines where minigames can be played, including third-person shooter and racing games.</resource>

Sinistar: Mankind's last hope, you must shoot down asteroids while picking up items to increase your ships power before the battle with the Sinistar.</resource>

Thanks to technology, the computer does all the hard stuff, like rolling dice, for you. Freed of the anxiety of arguing over leaners, you have plenty of time to strategize your next financial move. Up to four players, or you and three computer opponents, take turns around the board. A player wins when the others go belly up. You can also play a quick game mode or a time limit game. In any of the game modes, you can institute your own house rules. Some of those could include awarding a person for landing on free parking, dealing out some properties at random to begin the game, or changing the number of properties you have to own in a group before you can build houses. The easy-to-use interface makes it easy to manage your finances. When you have multiple players, the games can take a long time to finish, but that's the nature of Monopoly.</resource>

The game features a selection of procedurally generated dungeons, each of which has its own size, depth, selection of monsters and various special rules/features. You start out with base stats and quickly gain experience levels for killing monsters (which are invisible, and which you can judge only by looking at your max HP). It doesn't take many kills before you stop gaining exp levels. To help yourself in the dungeon, you can bring up to 10 single-use cards (more can be found in the dungeon), which act as spells.</resource>

Monster House is an action-adventure game developed by Artificial Mind and Movement and published by THQ. The game is based on the film of the same name.

Although the game was marketed toward the same pre-teen audience as the accompanying film, its gameplay was highly reminiscent of Resident Evil 4; the game was generally higher-quality than many other games based on children's films, and it received high ratings from numerous prominent gaming magazines and websites, including Play magazine and GameZone.

Monster House was met with mixed reviews. Aggregating review websites GameRankings and Metacritic gave the Game Boy Advance version 66.50% and 69/100, the GameCube version 65.13% and 60/100,  the DS version 63.65% and 62/100 and the PlayStation 2 version 60.64% and 59/100.</resource>

These monsters can then be tested in in-game tournaments, or battled against other players in 2P mode with the GBA link cable. 

Monsters are created in the game's shrine through the entry of letters, numbers and punctuation symbols. Players begin with the ability to enter up to 4 characters to make monsters, and can unlock the ability to use up to 8 characters through gaining higher trainer ranks. Different words or combinations of characters can not only make different types of monsters, but each monster can have varying attributes and characteristics, making each one unique.

Players then train the monsters by choosing  which foods to feed, which drills to do to raise attributes, what training to send them to for new attacks, and what items to give them. The game starts with a modest amount of money with which food and items can be purchased, more money is earned in tournaments. Gameplay revolves around planning training sessions, adding new attacks and juggling a bank account, along with attempting to win tournaments. As monsters age, they can be added to a coaching staff to help raise new monsters to better attributes, or they can be combined with other monsters to make stronger babies. Monsters do not die in this game, however, they do face an enforced retirement age.

There is a fairly straightforward storyline, where some characters from older Monster Rancher games visit, and new characters are introduced. The gameplay itself, like most other Monster Rancher games, is open-ended and has unlimited replay value.

The 2 Player mode, involving a link cable and two copies of the game, allows players to test the monsters they have raised against other players. The 2P mode also allows players to trade items and cash with one another, to wager items or cash on tournaments, and trade raised monsters into each others' games.</resource>

Bass Fishing is a normal fishing game where you can catch a variety of fish including various bass, northern pike, catfish, and more.  The &amp;quot;monster&amp;quot; part is that you get bonus points for catching monster-sized fish.

The game is played in one of two modes, Challenge or Free Fish.  In Free Fish, you can fish in any location that is unlocked for as long as you like.  In Challenge, you are competing in a tournament and will have a time limit and a specific location to fish at.

When you start at a location in either mode, you have the option to move your boat to any place on the map.  However, this does take time and may not always be in your best interest in the Challenge mode.  You can then either start casting, or you can change your lure first.

Catching fish is really just a matter of using a good lure and tempting movements.  When a fish strikes, you need to keep enough pressure on the line to keep the hook set, or the fish will get away.  If you let the line get too tight, the line will break and you'll lose the fish then as well.  Now just reel it in and see what you caught.

The GUI shows a nice fish finder that is color-coded by the type of fish that is seen.  Note that this finder is not always accurate.

Statistics for the game are very nice.  You can see a nice picture of your fish that you catch along with the size of it.  The top 6 can then be saved in the Aquarium for viewing at any time.  Your tournament scores will be based on weight of fish and any monster bonuses (bonuses for catching one of the top 3 largest fish that round).  Winning the tournaments will unlock new locations and let you progress to a new location for the next tournament.  It will also get you a nice trophy.</resource>

You just shoot things. The real skill though is in knowing just what to shoot and when to shoot it and where some targets reap sizeable rewards others will drain your score in no time at all. One addition to version three is the introduction of protected birds flying around with your intended targets which means that shooting now takes a little more thought than simply blasting into the sky. Other features remain intact and there are still items that need to be avoided such as balloons and various animals on the ground. As usual though you'll need to experiment to find out just what's worth hitting and what's not.

One of the best parts of the Moorhen series has been the hidden bonuses and secrets but they've always been well concealed and you're more likely to discover them by accident rather than actually work them out. I won't spoil some of the goodies we've discovered in this version but Moorhuhn 2 featured spiders that could be spun around trees and the first edition had you shaking trees then shooting down ten leaves for a 100 point bonus. Finally the hi-score chart is still there as is the wonderful battery back up so you can prove that you did actually get a score over 50.</resource>

Two players face each other across a board composed of rectangles in a grid of 9 ranks by 9 files yielding an 81 square board. In Japanese they are called Sente (first player) and Gote (second player), but in English are conventionally referred to as Black and White, with Black the first player. The board is nearly always rectangular, and the rectangles are undifferentiated by marking or color. Pairs of dots mark the players' promotion zones. Each player has a set of 20 flat wedge-shaped pentagonal pieces of slightly different sizes. Except for the kings, opposing pieces are undifferentiated by marking or color. Pieces face forward by having the pointed side of each piece oriented toward the opponent's side – this shows who controls the piece during play.</resource>

    <resource id="d062b2bb3dd1977a4790504f8ecd6776d0c2cf5c" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">The Nowhere Islands are an idyllic place; the residents of Tazmily Village live peacefully and in harmony with nature and with each other. But this changes when the mysterious Pigmask Army arrives and proceeds to destroy and corrupt, with force and sly persuasion alike. The main character is Lucas, a young boy who must find out who wants to destroy the tranquility of Nowhere Islands and turn them into a high-tech nightmare. 

Mother 3 is a top-down role-playing game. The player character (the characters controlled by the player change often) travels around the Nowhere Islands with his party, talking to people and furthering the plot. It is possible to &amp;quot;dash&amp;quot;, which not only allows to travel faster, but also allows to knock weaker enemies out of the way (or to ram some objects/characters). 

There are many enemies to battle in the game. The battles are turn-based; each turn, a character can attack with his weapon, use a special ability (some characters have powerful psychic abilities, others have different special skills), use an item or try to run away. The battles feature a musical combo system, where tapping a button in rhythm with the background music will cause additional damage to the enemy. The characters have &amp;quot;rolling HP meters&amp;quot;; when they are dealt damage, they don't lose all the HP right away, but their HP decreases slowly; this way, even if a character receives massive damage, he can survive with only minor injuries if you manage to end the combat quickly. Winning battles gives the characters experience (and thus makes them stronger) and, later in the game, money (known as &amp;quot;DP&amp;quot;), which can be used in shops to buy better equipment or useful objects. 

There are many frogs encountered throughout the game, who serve as save points (and later as ATM machines). If all characters die during a battle, you can come back to life near the latest save point encountered and try again.</resource>

    <resource id="a42e6697783de90275637dad726a956efcf0d992" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Motocross Challenge is a 2D side-scrolling motorcycle game combining regular racing and tricks. The game can only be played through an emulator or a GBA flashcard but is not strictly homebrew. It is a game made by a commercial developer, but when the project was cancelled by two publishers, they decided to release the game for free. The game can also be ordered on a cartridge from the developer's website. In 2010 it was followed up with an iPhone/iPad release.

The tracks remind of Excitebike while the gameplay seems inspired by Motocross Maniacs. The game offers two main modes: Free Ride (choose an unlocked bike and track to practise) and Challenge. The Challenge mode involves a series of events in 3 major categories: Beat the Clock (time-based), Trick Attack (points-based) and World Tour (race against 3 AI opponents). When all courses are finished, the final event, MXC Championship, is unlocked. The events are divided over different trees and completing certain courses unlocks new tracks or one of the 8 available bikes. The bikes have different statistics based on speed, handling, acceleration, height, boost and suspension.

Gameplay involves a fair amount of physics. When the bike accelerates, the front wheel leaves the ground and this needs to be compensated by nudging the d-pad. Up and down on the d-pad is used to switch lanes. Many tricks (activated through the L-button) involve balance and constant correcting is needed. Next to accelerating, braking and tricks, there is a button for boost. Only a limited amount is offered, but it constantly regenerates at a slow rate. It is used to gain extra speed, especially before big jumps to gain extra air time. The full amount of boost should never be used or let maxed out, as too little or too much slows the bike down. While in the air, using a combination of the L-button and the d-pad, players can perform tricks such as superman, nac-nac of backflip. By completing Trick Attack events, new tricks can be unlocked.

There are different types of tracks, set on a beach, an arena, downtown, in the snow, in a forest, in a desert and even a dump. They contain a series of jumps but also areas that slow down the bike, along with obstacles. The game screen shows the current position of the player (in World Tour), the current location on the track along with the finish, the time (remaining time in Beat the Clock), the current lap (in World Tour), the boost meter and the amount of points for a trick, and the remaining trick points needed (in Trick Attack). The game supports passwords to save and restore the player's progress.</resource>

Each motorcycle in the game handles differently with some performing better on paved roads and others working better on rougher terrain.[1]

There are a number of different modes: Grand Prix (GP), Motocross, and Traffic. GP takes place at a number of different locations across the world on paved tracks in places such as San Francisco and Russia. The paved tracks require the player to learn how to effectively use their brakes around corners. The GP courses contain small differences between them, giving more variety to the courses in the game. Motocross requires the player to drive on off-road terrain and to master the act of &amp;quot;powersliding&amp;quot; on corners. The courses found in Motocross races are less hospitable and often take place in arid and unkept locales and with obstacles. Traffic mixes both GP and Motocross, having mixed pavement courses and traffic on roads that serve as obstacles.</resource>

To do this, you will need to drill down several thousands of feet avoiding being crushed and remembering to pick up air tanks.This is a real-time puzzle game where you will be continually moving down or sideways in an effort to get to the bottom. As you dig, blocks will fall to fill in the spaces below. Like colored blocks will stick together (giving you time to rest), but will disappear if 4 or more blocks come together. This can cause chain reactions (very common in two-color levels) that become dangerous quickly.Three modes of play: Story, Time Attack, and Endless Driller. Story Mode uses the bare bones story from above. Time Attack gives you a set levels with a specific time limit. Endless Driller allows you to dig for as long as you can.</resource>

As the whole series, it takes away most rules and tactics (leaving 36 offensive and 18 defensive plays) while focusing on an action oriented approach. Because of the limited control scheme of the system, the options on the field are less in comparison to the main console version: besides the usual movement, passing and player moving commands, the player also may tackle, leap or activate a turbo boost. The playing perspective is an angled pseudo-3D view with the goals at the top/low side of the screen.

Both in the exhibition and season mode (17 weeks), the game offers the choice between 32 teams with different statistics regarding passing, defensive and line. The mini games, which can be also selected from the main menu, are basically practice modes for field goal and goal-line situations as well as a NFL trivia quiz.</resource>

    <resource id="d8cc4fed021c1c03614a7f152ff9b2c45618bbbb" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">NHL 2002 is the only entry in Electronic Arts' hockey series to be released on the Game Boy Advance. With the console versions having migrated to 3D graphics years earlier, the handheld game retains a 2D top-down view very similar to the earliest titles in the series on the Genesis and SNES.

Besides a standard mode for exhibition games, the game has a practice mode where the number of players on the field can be freely chosen. Season mode is unusual in that, unlike in other games, the player doesn't select a team to lead through a season. Instead, the game includes the full game schedule of the 2001-2002 NHL season, and any team in any scheduled game can be played. If no games of interest are scheduled on a given day, it can be skipped and the results simulated. The season mode also includes the ability to trade players, sign free agents and even to create players.

The game also includes a multi player mode over the link cable, with up to four players able to join for cooperative or competitive play.</resource>

Set in the late 18th century, Napoleon's story is told in Fire Emblem fashion via strategic maps and character dialogue. However, the game takes many liberties with historical accuracy, such as Napoleon fighting man-eating ogres and abominable snowmen. The objectives for the missions vary slightly, but the basic idea is to send out units, defeat the enemy and take over the opponent's stronghold.</resource>

Join those lovers of all things equine by becoming a virtual horseman who works on a ranch located upon a tranquil hillock. The master of the ranch raises horses, breeds them and his hired hands soothe their harried spirits when occasion calls. Searching out strong bloodlines for birth forth new generations of champions is also requisite. The reward for giving all this love sits in the specious world of horse racing where victory is never assured and dreams run in fleeting slivers of seconds. Contribute to the success of the ranch by improving your skills via mini-games and by riding horses with skill in races. The beginning of the game requires a short trial where the player races a horse across the length of a track to prove his worth. Horse racing games satisfy a very small niche in America, marking their turf firmly in Japan but there is an audience of sorts for this type of game. Yushun Rhapsody supports the Mobile Adaptor for linking with ethereal players to race steeds over the wireless spectrum.</resource>

The game covers the first 70 episodes of Naruto, primarily the Prologue — Land of Waves and Chūnin Exams arcs. During the game's first play-through, the player is restricted to using Naruto, Sakura, Sasuke and occasionally Kakashi. After the game is completed, other characters can be unlocked by first beating them in a side-story mission.
Characters also have a wide range of techniques available. Players can equip items to characters such as chakra pills, healing items and ranged weapons such as kunai and shuriken. Characters can create clones which can be used as decoys and some characters can create full-bodied clones which can be used in combination attacks and to perform offensive techniques. Characters can also use the transformation techniques to take on the appearance of another character, to trick the opponent.</resource>

Thanks to the help of the teams at Roland Garros and the US Open, who provided exact plans of their stadiums, the development team were able to produce faithfully accurate models of the most famous courts at Roland Garros and the US Open, as well as of 6 other courts with different surfaces (grass, synthetic). The players must prove themselves on the authentic courts of these world-famous tournaments, in front of crowds who react to their performance.</resource>

Mahjong involves skill, strategy, and calculation, as well as a certain degree of chance. Depending on the variation which is played, luck can be anything from a minor to a dominant factor in success. In Asia, mahjong is also popularly played as a gambling game. In the game, each player is dealt either thirteen or sixteen tiles in a hand (depending on the variation being played). On their turn, players draw a tile and discard one, with the goal of making four or five melds (also depending on the variation) and one pair, or &amp;quot;head&amp;quot;. Winning comes &amp;quot;on the draw&amp;quot;, by drawing a new or discarded tile that completes the hand. Thus a winning hand actually contains fourteen (or seventeen) tiles.</resource>

The story in the game follows the movie pretty well and it is well presented through in-game and comic dialog style cinematics. It's about a Grizzly bear named Boog who is very happy with his domesticated home. But one day he gets in trouble with his new friend Elliot and the town's authority decides to put them back in the woods where they belong. Unfortunately, for them, the hunting season has just begun and Boog has no idea how to survive outside of his garage home with his beloved caretaker, Beth. 

The game begins just before Boog and Elliot are dropped in the woods. You control Boog and he has many cool moves. He can jump, roll, grab and throw forest animals as well as roar. The goal of the game is to protect the forest animals from the hunters. The forest is full of hunters and boss hunters in each animal territory. It is your job to clean up the forest so play it wild and rally an army of forest critters in a hilarious quest to scare off the hunters!</resource>

    <resource id="524420f515bc80890bf4f691c26fe8f6c0b11eb1" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">The game continues the tradition of Tengai Makyou series, also known as &amp;quot;Far East of Eden&amp;quot;. You play as either Tenran or Aoi, a teenage boy and girl, respectively, on quest to defeat the ancient evil that threatens the prosperous land of Jipang, to prove themselves worthy of the legendary Fire Clan, warriors who have been protecting Jipang for many generations from evil demons and warlocks. The land Jipang is very similar to medieval Japan, and during your adventure you'll also visit Mongolia, China, and other Asian countries.

The most important new feature of the game is a non-linear storyline. You can tackle many missions in any order you want, and the storyline also changes depending on the outcome of major battles. If you lose against a boss enemy, the game is not over, but instead, a branching storyline path is revealed. Otherwise, the gameplay is similar to other Tengai Makyou games, featuring overworld map traveling and first person perspective, turn-based combat.</resource>

The point of most levels is to collect candy which can be used to upgrade abilities or buy items to &amp;quot;decorate&amp;quot; the forest. Outside the player must avoid obstacles, such as pets, humans, and cars, and make it back to the hedge. The game is geared toward children.</resource>

1. Pac-Man: The original arcade classic, complete and un-cut. 
2. Pac-Mania: A conversion of the 1987 update to Pac-Man, which takes the elements of the original arcade game and puts it into an isometric view, as well as adding the ability to jump.
3. Pac-Man Arrangement: Never re-produced outside of the arcade, Arrangement again uses the elements of the original Pac-Man and adds a fifth ghost, who can change shape and size when combined with the other 4 ghosts, and make life harder for Pac-Man. New power-ups are also included, like the ability to dash quickly around the screen, warp points to get from one place to the other and new ways of catching ghosts.
Pac-Attack: Like Tetris before it, you must fit falling blocks together to complete a line to clear the screen. In this case, the falling tiles also have ghosts in them, and once the Pac-Man tile appears (a tile with the Pac-Man symbol), Pac-Man will eat all of the ghosts that are in his path until he gets to a dead end.</resource>

He still faces opposition, however, from ghostly nemeses like Inky, Blinky, Pinky, and Clyde. He must also run, jump, and swim his way past other malevolent creatures, such as skeletons, spiders, and killer fish. Thankfully, Pac-Man has a variety of attack methods. Excluding ghosts, most baddies are susceptible to projectile &amp;quot;Pac-Dots,&amp;quot; the &amp;quot;Ultra Butt-Bounce&amp;quot; (which also helps him jump higher), or the &amp;quot;Rev Roll,&amp;quot; a speed burst allowing Pac-Man to make lengthy jumps off ramps. When disposing of ghosts though, he must first ingest a good old-fashioned Power Pellet, then devour them before its effects wear off.</resource>

In response to this, the great Wizard Pac created a potion that turned 5 ordinary fruit into the &amp;quot;Golden Fruit.&amp;quot; A young knight called Sir Pac-alot fought and sealed Spooky underneath a large tree using the Golden Fruit, which were attached to the branches of the tree. In the present time late at night, Inky, Pinky, Blinky and Clyde sneak into the village and, in their mischief, pick the Golden Fruit off the tree in the center of town. Unfortunately, this has released Spooky from his prison. Spooky tells the ghosts to take the Golden Fruit and follow him if they wish to rid the land of the Pac-people forever. When Pac-Man awakes, he hears the news from Professor Pac about the Golden Fruit and Spooky, and sets off to defeat the ghosts and Spooky.</resource>

You can perform all manner of illegal activities to try to achieve wealth, including carjackings, murders, shootings and run-overs. 

Stealing vehicles is the real meat of the game, as these must be used for the various missions, which are obtained by walking over to phone boxes, as in GTA. There are dozens of these, all with different handling characteristics, and include trucks, buses and even boats.

The mission structures are non-linear, meaning that how you perform in one part can affect how later parts unfold, and the game includes Perspective Corrected 3D graphics with realistic shadows and rotational effect, as well as a full 3D soundtrack of aggressive rap and mid-tempo rock.</resource>

    <resource id="a3fa7eebc528ed45fb39043cc84fae04bd6ed309" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Sometime in the 1980s, the Japanese Choro-Q Racing toys made their way to U.S. shores. Renamed Penny Racers for the benefit of American sales, the wind-up cars were built to perform different tricks (wheelies and spins, mostly) when a penny was inserted into their chassis. The plastic racers are still very popular in Japan, inspiring a video game called CHORO-Q ADVANCE. The U.S. release of the game is called GADGET RACERS, and it's every bit as exciting as the toys that it's based on. Command any of 50 unique vehicles through 40 different courses of obstacles, tricks, and general mayhem. You can customize your racer to meet your specifications, using more than 130 different parts to soup things up upgrade your tires, brakes, steering, engines, and more. Adding to the excitement is the fact that you can get four players competing for glory via a link cable and for Game Boy Advance consoles. It's a mystery why the toys no longer roam the bedroom floors of American households, but maybe this awesome video game will create a resurgence.</resource>

From Pinobee's fluid animation to the detailed environments he explores, it's obvious that a lot of spit and polish has been applied to this Pak. Pinobee screenshots may lead you to believe that this is a standard action platform game, but that is far from an accurate description. Pinobee can walk along the ground or shimmy up walls, but his main means of locomotion is dashing through the air. As he makes it deeper in his quest, Pinobee gains the ability to dash farther and farther through the air. Soon enough, he's spending more time hovering and dashing through the sky than on the ground. This unique play control system gives Pinobee a fresh feel.</resource>

Joining with a group of survivors, the player must make their way to the heart of the Ape Empire and stop General Ursus, who is planning a final attack on mankind.

The gameplay is a side-scrolling action game, similar to Prince of Persia, having the player avoid various traps and pitfalls by jumping and climbing. They must also avoid various enemies including armed apes that will try to stop the player at all costs, but the player has weapons of their own. The player will start out with a knife and eventually will upgrade to a pistol and a shotgun.

There are 13 levels in all, with the story being told through still picture cut scenes that are modeled after the films. There is also a password feature for players to pick up and play at their leisure.</resource>

As with your standard pinball video game, the left button on the D-pad and the A-button control the flippers with the R/L triggers used to shake the table. The catch here is that everything is themed in Pokémon. Instead of a ball, you make use of a Pokéball. Instead of standard bumpers, you're hitting the Pokéball against other Pokémon, and the ultimate goal is of course to &amp;quot;catch 'em all&amp;quot;. The game features 200 Pokémon, two main tables, and link cable support.</resource>

    <resource id="cb95c8043a9011a6e4449d26d59e83ebe1e37663" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Polarium Advance is basically the same as Polarium for the Nintendo DS, but a couple of new blocks have been added.

This is a puzzle game in which the player must create horizontal lines of all the same color (either black or white). To change the color (or &amp;quot;polarity&amp;quot;) of a block, you must select the blocks in one line. In most puzzles, you can use the border to lengthen the line. The new blocks in the Advance version are: Hurdle Tiles, which you cannot pass, Multi-Tiles, which count as black or white, and Solid Tiles, which will not turn but are removed so that the tiles above them fall down. There are 365 puzzles in this mode (Daily Polarium) ranging from very easy to quite challenging.

The Time Attack Mode requires you to solve either ten easy puzzles or five hard puzzles within the time given. Leaving a block of the wrong color in a line results in a 30 seconds penalty. 

It is possible to create your own puzzles and share them with friends. Puzzles created in the Nintendo DS version of the game are compatible with the GBA version.</resource>

Once styled and trained you'll see your contestant progress through the auditions, various heats, and then, hopefully, make it to the grand final. You'll need quick fingers as you match the right combination of buttons to what's displayed on the screen helping your contestant sing a sweet harmony and dance to the rhythm of the song. Get it wrong and your voice fades and goes out of tune as the judges and later the audience grow unsettled.</resource>

As a whole, it is part of the larger Jikkyo Powerful Pro Yakyu series also developed for the main console systems.

The game includes a Success mode, where the baseball sequences are combined with a larger storyline introducing simulation and role-playing elements. Generally, the aim is to train a weak player to become one of the best, mixed with different intrigues. In this version, the player's character was once a famous high school baseball player who got killed. A doctor resurrected him as a robot and now he needs to go to three stages to regain his status. The first phase requires the character to get drafted with a team, in the second he needs to earn money to earn a life-long battery and the third and final phase requires acquiring a memory level of more than 80%. The character can go to his former high school and duel rivals in different mini-games.

The player's character has HP, a stress bar and a memory bar, which are affected by various events. The player can do jobs to earn money and power-ups, restore health, date a girlfriend, train or mediate, suffer from illness or emotional trauma, and there is even an inventory with items and a screen with all the acquired abilities.

Other modes are Exhibition, Arrange (create custom teams), Data and different mini-games. Playing against other people using a link cable is supported. The customization options are extensive, ranging from the amount of control the computer is given (hitting, pitching, running players, switching and fielding) to the different team and player statistics. Games consists of several innings where the player takes turns hitting and pitching. Most of the traditional game rules are followed.</resource>

The game's main feature is its Success story scenario, &amp;quot;Sunrise Highschool Edition&amp;quot;, which follows a boy who is inflicted with a deadly curse after accidentally knocking over a memorial headstone. His friends start vanishing and his Baseball club is set ablaze. If he does not rebuild the club and win the Koshien tournament in three years, even he will be dragged into a vortex of oblivion.

The player must manage the protagonist's weekly routine to train, recruit new teammates, fix the Baseball club and date one out of a few love interests. Failing the story's objectives or losing any late-game matches results in a game over which erases the player's save file. It is possible to reset the game to prevent that, but there are restrictions and penalties for doing so.

POWER RANGERS: SPACE PATROL DELTA for the Game Boy Advance puts players in control of all five members of the Space Patrol Delta team as they battle the evil Emperor Gruumm and his army of robots. In the future, Earth has become home to many different alien races. While most of them are peaceful, some are not. In order to protect earth, six teens were called to form the Space Patrol Delta team. Players will control a certain ranger for each of the nine levels. While the rangers' fighting abilities are similar, each has his or her own unique power. The Red Ranger can move through objects, the Yellow Ranger can create duplicates of herself, the Green Ranger can see heat trails, the Blue Ranger can create a force field, and the Pink Ranger can replicate objects she touches. There's also a Shadow Ranger who has special abilities players will uncover as they progress through the game. Each level in this platformer has players running, jumping, and attacking enemies as they guide the chosen ranger through the many obstacles that Gruumm has created. Each of the nine levels is controlled by a boss that the Rangers must defeat to move on. After certain levels, the Rangers will summon the Megazord to do battle with giant monsters. Fans of the POWER RANGERS won't want to miss this instalment in the series. POWER RANGERS: SPACE PATROL DELTA is an out-of-this-world fighting experience.</resource>

Including all 32 teams participating in the tournament rated in four areas (defense, midfield, attack and overall) with fictional player names (although fans will quickly recognize who T. Brinks and M. Pallack from Germany, Manillas from Spain and Romualdo of Brazil are), players can take part in friendlies, play the World Cup (the real 2006 groups are included, but it's possible to randomize them) or train for penalty shootouts. 

Gameplay is simple and straightforward. A and B buttons control kicking the ball (low and high, respectively), being possible to shoot at goal using either one, all depending on distance to goal. After kicking the ball, the player can add aftertouch to the ball tapping the d-pad, making it go away from the goalkeeper of from a defender. The R button allows the player to accelerate, as long as he has enough stamina, shown by white circles under his name. Several tactical options such as formation, strategy and individual orders are included.</resource>

    <resource id="890ce5a0d8617793cbbd25583bb31b03e0d4e0e5" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Pro Beach Soccer is the first game based on the Summer variation of football, played by five players aside on a sandy surface. The game includes 32 national teams (some with their real stars) plus 6 all star teams to be unlocked in 3 game modes (Exhibition, Pro Beach Soccer Tour and Tournament)  played in Bangkok, Rio de Janeiro, Marseille or Venice Beach.

Gameplay is classic arcade, with one button to pass, another to juggle the ball and another to shoot. One of the key aspects is the &amp;quot;State of Grace&amp;quot;; by making fancy moves (such as overhead kicks, heel passes or heading the ball back and forth) and scoring goals, a power bar starts filling, and when it's full, all team attributes are maxed up and the players are given the ability to quickly run with the ball.</resource>

There is word of an award so the students are busy searching high and low for it. Naturally our heros, Amitie and her school nemesis Raffine, make their way toward the distant dark castle. Challenging, and being challenged by, everyone you come across in a game of, Puyo Pop!  

A puzzle game of the falling-block variety the goal of which is to clear your blocks (Puyos) by is the combining four or more of the same color which will vanish. This will produce Nuisance Puyos. These colorless Puyos will fall onto you opponents screen, thus blocking chains and combos they could create. These pesky Puyos can only be exterminated by removing neighboring Puyos.

When an opponent send Nuisance Puyos to you screen you can try to &amp;quot;offset&amp;quot; by clearing your own Puyos and limiting the number that would fall on your screen. This will also increase your Fever Meter. When this meter fills you will be given a set of prearranged Puyos with which you can wrack up giant combos and send tons of Nuisance Puyos to you opponent. When any players field becomes so full they can no longer drop Puyos they lose the game.

Jaguar is a Japanese gag manga series written and illustrated by Kyosuke Usuta. The story is about recorders, musicians, and their bizarre daily lives. It has a vague overall plot but is mainly episodic. This RPG's call to fame is its unique use (in the handheld arena, at least) of 3D glasses to create special stereoscopic effects. The game sports both basic platformer stages as well as 3/4 top-down areas. Features include seven different worlds, humorous action, and a flute meter.</resource>

This can be achieved by getting all the fruit and gems in the level, or killing off enemies. There are 80 levels to complete and once you complete all of them, the levels are repeated. 

You exit each level by collecting all the gold keys then entering through the door that opens. You have a certain amount of time to complete the level before spikes fall down the level. There are eight areas, all consisting of ten levels. At the end of each area, there is a guardian waiting for you, and again, you have a certain amount of time to defeat them.

You kill enemies by throwing orange-colored eggs at them, and in the earlier levels, they go down in one or two shots, but in later levels, you'll find out that all of them take more than two shots to bring down, so your orange balls would be useless here. The solution is to get a special power-up that will give you chocolate eggs.

Besides gold keys, you can also collect silver keys. This lets you unlock a gate, giving you access to more shots or power-ups. There are also booby traps in the level, such as spikes, and some parts of a level are blocked off by spikes. Get a mushroom and they turn into flowers that you can pick up. Beware, getting another mushroom will make them turn into spikes again. 

Apart from the normal levels, there are challenges where you have to complete a level and get all the fruit as you can under a 20-second time limit. Depending on gameplay, there are  also tricks where the last key you have to get flies away and you have to catch it. Other tricks include turning on the lights to see enemies, and running away from the &amp;quot;happy ghost&amp;quot;. You'll receive bonus points at the end of the level if you manage to collect every gem in the level.

Qwak can be played as either a one or two player game. The game was released at budget price, and later on a CD double pack with Alien Breed '92.</resource>

    <resource id="05c2f725c7374a7702f4da2578a0bbed1c7f9084" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">R-Type III was originally released only on the Super Famicom/SNES, but later ported to the Game Boy Advance. It was the first game in the series to introduce new Forces. As well as the original Force (which was now named the Round Force, later named as the Standard Force in R-Type Delta), the player could choose from two other Forces: the Shadow Force and the Cyclone Force. These both had new, different weapon sets and special enhancements.

It also refined the weapons and charging system. It reverted to the original Red-Blue-Yellow weapon system, and the Diffusion Wave Cannon from R-Type II was replaced with a more standard wave cannon. Charging this cannon to full beam strength results in a massive, powerful beam that passes through all enemies and obstacles. A new weapon called the Hyper Wave Cannon was also added to the ship, which the player could use instead of the normal wave cannon if desired. By switching to Hyper mode and supercharging the wave cannon, the ship temporarily gains the ability to use the Hyper Wave Cannon, which is unique among wave cannons in having a rapid fire capability. The shots fired create damaging explosions, and if the player has collected one or two Bits, they spin around the ship burning with energy. However, this Hyper mode causes the ship to overheat after a short while, and it must subsequently spend seconds cooling down, during which time the wave cannon is inoperative.

The fighter in R-Type III is identified in R-Type Final as the R-9Ø Ragnarök; it was originally referred to as 'R-90'. In fact, the original R-90 has been split into three in Final: the R-9S Strike Bomber has the R-90's basic Standard force unit and first wave cannon, identified as Mega Wave Cannon. Final's version of the R-90 has the Shadow Force and Hyper Wave Cannon, but is unable to choose its Force or switch between Wave Cannons. Finally, the R-9Ø2 Ragnarok II has the R-90's final Force, the Cyclone Force, and the Giga Wave Cannon, which can be charged through 7 loops. It can be assumed that this is because the original R-90 would simply be too powerful for the game to be any kind of challenge.</resource>

To these stock elements, it adds one more: weaponry. Now you can choose to nitro past the opponent ahead of you, or slow him down with a missile.

With each vehicle and driver pair you can race in Practice Mode to familiarize yourself with tracks or choose a Championship Mode to progress through a series of circuits. After each race you'll need to spend some of the money you've earned (either by placing or picking up money icons during the race) to repair and -- if possible -- upgrade your car. The upgrades can improve your car as a racing machine (e.g. a larger engine or better brakes) or as a war machine (e.g. adding more weapons bays or buying a new type of weapon).

The track design uses the isometric view, and almost never puts the car behind an obstacle. However, among the twisty roads are a few shortcuts that require you to think outside the lines of the road, and occasionally take a leap of faith.</resource>

Rayman lives in a land called Protoons, and that peaceful existence is threatened when Mr. Dark kidnaps all of the other citizens. The kicker is that Rayman needs these fellow Protoons to keep his powers. Now, an armless and legless Rayman must find his way around the land, freeing those Protoons he comes across. Plus, with sixty different levels spread out over six worlds players will have no shortage of Rayman fun. In Rayman 3 the limbless hero must once again head out into an unwilling adventure as one of his friends, Globox, has disappeared. As in the first one, Rayman must freed imprisoned characters as they traverse through the fifty levels. If players find that they still want more Rayman action after they've finished the main story line they can use the multiplayer link to play in some different challenges.</resource>

Globox, a friend of Rayman, has placed the world in peril. By eating the Lord of the Dark Lums, Globox has enraged the Hoodlums, who plan to take back their master no matter what the cost to the world around them. It's up to Rayman to save the day and find a cure to rid the Dark Lord from Globox.

New abilities, thanks to power ups littered around the levels, allow Rayman to use the likes of Heavy Metal Fist and the Shock Rocket to take down enemies around him, while the lock jaw allows Rayman to get to hard to reach places.

Rayman 3 can link to a Gamecube via the link port, allowing players to play exclusive mini-games on both systems and download new levels to the GBA.</resource>

The game has music supplied by the record production company J.P. ROOM, and is developed by the team responsible for Wario Ware.  This is visible in the quirky presentation of the game.

As with Wario Ware, the game is actually a series of shorter games bundled into one package.  Before each game starts, you are presented with a short tutorial that gets you ready and practice before you begin the real thing.  Control is normally very simple - usually, only the A Button is required, but some games make players press multiple buttons for different actions.

Players will punch in time with a karate expert as pots and rocks are thrown; pluck hairs off of an onion; march in time to an instructor; hit a baseball while the screen zooms in and out; shoot ghosts with arrows; chop demons as a samurai; and much more.  At the end of each set of stages is a 'remix stage' - in this stage, sections of the previously played stages are combined and thrown at you at random, all while a single song plays.</resource>

Taking its cue from the latest series, this GBA Robot Wars game cranks up the action with new events, new robots, new arenas and a wide range of new game features.

The game brings together all the elements of the TV show - players can design and build their own robots, drawing upon a database of body parts, armour, engines, wheels and weapons. Once complete, battle can commence!

The game also features a quick start `pick up and play' function, so gamers can select from a range of pre-built robots, and get straight to the realistic 3D action.</resource>

    <resource id="ba350be3a1c2cc276fb02a894e40d9999da5230c" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Based on the Blue Sky film (distributed by Fox) of the same name,
Robots takes players on an adventure to save Robot city. When Rodney Copperbottom travels to Robot City to meet Big Weld, the famous inventor, he finds that something is wrong. Big Weld is missing and the evil Ratchet has taken over Big Weld Industries. With the help of his friends the Rusties, Rodney puts an end to Ratchet's villainous ways and restores order to the city.

Robots uses a unique perspective that combines 2D side-scrolling with 3D views. The game takes the player to locations from the movie like Robot City, Big Weld's Mansion, the Outmode, and Madame Gasket's Chop Shop. Using the invention mode, players build and upgrade Rodney's weapons including the wrench, scrap gun, electro zapper, and magno grenade. With a combination of navigation, jumping, and combat skills, players can make their way though the world of Robots and bring an end to Ratchet's tyranny.

In addition to the main story line, players will find robots in need all over the city. The parts these poor robots are missing can be found hidden in the numerous maps and returning the correct part rewards the player with power-ups and weapon upgrades. All of the maps are interconnected, so players can easily find their way back to a previous area to uncover additional secrets.The maps are connected with a transit ball mini-game, just like the transit system in the movie.

The DS version of the game features a map that can be annotated by the player, a unique 3D version of the transit ball game that utilizes the stylus for control, and 3D menus. In addition to the new features, the DS also includes high resolution maps that include more detail than the GBA version.</resource>

This is true of ROCK â€˜EM SOCK â€˜EM ROBOTS, a game that pits a blue robot against a red robot in a boxing match. DSI Games and Full Fat, recognizing the popularity of the toy, has created a Game Boy Advance version of ROCK â€˜EM SOCK â€˜EM ROBOTS so players no longer need to have their punching robot handy to go a few rounds. The core concept of ROCK â€˜EM SOCK â€˜EM ROBOTS transfers over to the GBA with no problem. Players select which of the robots they want to control and get into the ring, punching and blocking their way to victory. Gamers can practice, play a quick fight, or enter a tournament to see if they can claim the title of Rock â€˜em Sock â€˜em master. The game also features a two player mode using the Game Boy Advance Link, giving players the chance to battle their friends in much the same way they would play with the toy. This is the real joy of ROCK â€˜EM SOCK â€˜EM ROBOTS because playing against a friend really captures the feel of the classic robot battling game. Players who enjoy playing with the robot boxing toys will love ROCK â€˜EM SOCK â€˜EM ROBOTS. The toy translates over to the virtual world very well, and the game perfectly captures the classic feel and look of the toys.</resource>

You can then choose your Net Navi (initially available for selection are Mega Man, Roll, GutsMan and NumberMan).

Unlike previous Battle Network games, you do not directly control your Net Navi. Instead, you can tell your Navi which enemy they should attack, as well as their attacking distance, and they will perform according to your directions. You can also select to use Battle Chips (from three which are randomly selected from your folder) by using the Control Pad to select the chip described at the bottom of the screen, then pressing A to use it.</resource>

The player commands small groups of units in battle. The game has 2 modes: in the first mode, units moves on maps, choose which enemy to attack, and merge into larger groups; in the second mode, &amp;quot;battles&amp;quot;, the player chooses the type of attack for each unit and observes the results of duels. The story and characters are introduced by the many dialogues between missions.</resource>

Of course, as we all know, classic games never die and that's exactly what the smash pack featured. Because of that Sega and THQ announced that the Smash Pack would be making its way to Game Boy Advance. While the GBA version doesn't feature the exact same titles it does showcase Sonic Spinball (one of the lesser known titles), Ecco the Dolphin and Golden Axe.

All three titles were classics on Sega Genesis in the early 90's/late 80's.</resource>

Combining racing with tricks, the game allows players to choose from different events and challenges as they desire. The story mode of SSX 3 involves, like the previous entries in the series, becoming the best snowboarder in the world. Players have a cast of characters to select from, most of whom have appeared in previous SSX games. Once players have selected their character, they're off to the slopes to start winning races and performing huge tricks. The main mode has 12 different events players can participate in. Players select the event they want to compete in from the map. There are races, super pipe, big air, and other events, and there's something for everyone. Winning these events nets the player cash which can be used to upgrade their equipment. In addition to winning the race, players want to look good doing it, and that's where the tricks come in. Pull off enough of them, and the player's boost meter fills, rewarding them with some extra power. Complete enough tricks and the character learns new, even more dangerous and impressive tricks. Gamers who love snowboarding will enjoy SSX 3. While players can't explore as freely as they can in the console version of the game, the racing is still intense, and the many different game play options keep the game from getting boring or repetitive.</resource>

Tricky features far more storytelling than the original through the use of personality attributes. Rivalries develop between characters with opposing attributes, causing them to act more aggressively towards each other during races. The übertrick system adds a whole new layer to the game. These tricks are much tougher to pull off, but give you a nice boost. Performing six übertricks in a row results in a super übertrick, which rewards you with a bigger boost and causes Run DMC's &amp;quot;It's Tricky&amp;quot; to play. 

Seven tracks return from the original accompanied by brand-new Garibaldi and Alaska tracks. The returning tracks contain up to four times as many shortcuts and hidden lines. Six of the eight riders from the original return (Jurgen and Hiro suffered off-season injuries) and are joined by six new ones. The soundtrack will feature mixes by Mix Master Mike, Aphrodite, and the Plump DJs. DVD-like bonuses include &amp;quot;behind-the-scenes&amp;quot; footage and a &amp;quot;making of&amp;quot; segment.</resource>

Now, it is up to Sabreman to traverse the land in pursuit of these villains; and to retrieve the eight pieces of the amulet.

The game is separated into two modes of play: the 3D exploration mode and the 2D platforming sections. The 3D exploration mode is how Sabreman gets around the eight different themed worlds of Sabre Wulf. While there are no enemies in this mode, there are plenty of people to talk to, who might help you in your quest. Also strewn about are more than fifty 2D platforming levels, which you can access through the wulf's head tunnels.</resource>

    <resource id="1d136d08c3cf851746f0b416e3bfa24e8e4a2fc5" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Unlike its predecessor title, the player's skill and success for each battle are a major factor in determining how Sangokushi Kōmeiden will end. In addition to having decisions at the beginnings of most stages that affect troop placements for both sides, event triggers, and the items found in armories and granaries, the game also tracks the player's overall record by monitoring the character's physical health and counting the number of times the player has retreated from battle and restarted a level. Taking too many turns to reach a certain point in the story, or restarting battles too many times, will severely affect Zhuge's health and, if he becomes too weak, he will die before the decisive Battle of Wuzhang Plains takes place. However, if the player's skill is adequate, Zhuge Liang will feign death, luring his nemesis, Sima Yi, into the open. The game will then continue to the last chapter in a series of final battles against the kingdoms of Cao Wei and Sun Wu.</resource>

Set in a more fantastical Sengoku period, it involves a samurai hero or heroine on a journey from south to north of Japan driving away the demons who have taken over the country. While rather basic and repetitive in level design, the game's combat mechanics are well developed. The hero wields three different weapons for combating multiple enemies at once and can equip three different spells, which makes for some hectic boss fights on the end of each chapter.</resource>

The events of this game take place 20 or 30 years after the hero of the first game followed the neutral path, defeated the Asura Lord and the seraph Michael at the Cathedral, and founded a state where followers of both Law and Chaos ideals could live freely. But his reign of freedom doesn't last long. The Mesia faith gains power, expanding the Cathedral into a new enclosed environment named Millenium. The Gaians rise up, but their rebellion is repressed by the Mesians' elite warrior class, the Temple Knights. Some years later, a retired arena fighter Okamoto discovers a man fighting for his life against a demon. He rescues the man, who doesn't even remember his own name, and trains him to fight in the arena so they might both go on to a better living in one of the upper-class areas of Millenium. And thus the new battle for a better future begins...

&amp;quot;Shin Megami Tensei II&amp;quot; features all the gameplay innovations of the previous game. You can summon demons, fuse them, make them battle for you, talk to random enemies and receive information from them, etc. The combat is turn-based, and you explore the dungeons from a first-person perspective view.</resource>

Random battles can be arranged or competition in a tournament against all the games wrestlers. A player controls their wrestler with the directional buttons and the action buttons. By using punches and kicks, in close enough a punch can perform a grab. Once a wrestler is locked in a grab they can be tossed according to the directional buttons. The more abuse a character take the longer it will take them to stand up, this makes them very agreeable to kick or jump upon. By punching a fallen gladiator you will get him in a lock. When done closer to the injured legs you will usually try to bend them and when done closer to his head you will crush his cranium between your mighty thighs. If you can do this for ten seconds without him breaking free, your chosen wrestler will win.</resource>

    <resource id="36bbe3b3d5b8399a09557d0b577a69469b9bffef" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Shining Force is a turn-based tactical RPG. Battles take place in square grids, and each unit occupies one square. Each unit can move up to a fixed amount of squares along the battlefield, determined by its Move statistic. Depending on its location relative to enemies and to allies, a unit can also perform one action: attack, cast a spell, use an item, or search the area. Some commands, such as equipping or dropping items, don't count as actions. The order of turns is determined by the unit's agility score and a random seed.

In Shining Force, each allied unit is represented by a character with his or her own background and personality, much like in the Fire Emblem series. Although there are no &amp;quot;generic&amp;quot; units, except on the enemy side, most characters contribute little or nothing to the plot upon joining the player army.

Each allied unit also has a class, which defines a set of abilities for that unit and determines the spells and equipment they have access to. A unit can be promoted to another class at any level between 10 or 20. Upon promotion the character's level resets to 1 and statistics are reduced by a fixed amount, although they begin higher if the character had been promoted at a higher level.

Battle goals for the player are fairly simple: kill all enemies, kill the enemies' leader, or advance to a town or landmark. The enemy side wins if they kill the player's leader, Max, or if the player chooses to escape the battle by casting Egress. Even if the player army is defeated, the player can recover allies and retry the battle. The Force keeps any experience that is obtained, regardless of the battle's outcome. Thus, there is no Game Over, and the player's army gets stronger even upon its defeat, although Max's death results in the player losing half of their money.</resource>

    <resource id="58e5adff5e7e0d8f9e1d39832d645743a80f0a2a" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">The Dark Dragon was defeated by our hero in the first Shining Soul, and the people rejoiced as the Darkness faded away.  People are quick to forget, however.  As time passed, people's lives improved and they forgot about the Darkness.  But as the Light grew more and more powerful, it upset the balance between Light and Dark and soon Darkness was on the rise once again.

A prophet comes and warns the people of the impending dangers, but no one listens to him.  Although his crystal shows the upcoming dangers, the people pass by without any interest.  An agent of the Darkness, Gillespie, lures this prophet outside the city and kills him and shatters his crystal so the people remain ignorant of what is coming.

This same agent gives the &amp;quot;Forbidden Fruit&amp;quot; to Deatharte, the trusted adviser to King Marcel in Klantol Castle.  The adviser didn't trust Gillespie, but curiosity is a powerful force.

It is now up to another hero to take on the journey to once again stop this growing Darkness.  After choosing your character from 8 possible, you start out on his or her way to a tournament being held at Klantol castle.  On your way, you meet an adventurer who will explain how to battle.  Your journey then takes you to the castle to start the tournament.

This tournament is interrupted when the king finds out his daughter is missing.  The king's adviser heads out to find her, and the king asks that you go as well.  It is here that your story really begins.

The gameplay is similar to most RPGs of this type where the monsters are fought in real-time.  An interesting part of this game is that your resistances will increase when used.  Outside the castle, you can stand on a fire that will not damage your HP, but as your resistance reacts to the fire, it will increase slowly.  Traps will also increase your resistance if you are hit by them, though you will also be hurt.  Only the one fire is safe.

Take on many monsters, cast spells, get new equipment.  But most of all, save the world from Darkness.</resource>

Now players can battle their way through the story mode or fight a friend using the GBA link. SHREK SUPERSLAM features 10 characters from SHREK and SHREK II, including Shrek, Donkey, Fiona, Puss-n-Boots, the Gingerbread man, and more. They will battle it out in 10 different levels, each of which is inspired by scenes from the movies and is fully interactive. Each character has a basic light and heavy attack plus throws and a unique slam attack that they can use once they build up enough power by hitting their foes. Each character also has specific strengths and weaknesses that will impact how players battle with them. Players can also grab weapons that appear on each level and use them against their opponents. There are a number of different modes in the game, including the single-player story mode, tutorial mode, multiplayer mode, and the mega challenge mode. Story mode allows players to unlock more characters, stages, and alternate outfits for the fighters. Challenge mode presents players with a challenge a race, a number of items to collect, etc that they must accomplish before their opponents do. More special characters and unlockable items are available for players who complete each minigame. Fighting gamers will find that SHREK SUPERSLAM keeps all of the wicked humor and one-liners from the movies while creating an entertaining, addicting melee game.</resource>

Players must get through specific platform challenges by utilizing each character's strengths and abilities. Shrek is beefy, so he can carry items that can be stacked elsewhere, or butt-stomp weakened floors. Donkey can leap higher and kick down walls. Later on, players acquire new characters, like swashbuckling Puss In Boots who can cling to walls and grind down banisters, as well as plenty of other characters from the movie. Learn the attributes of each character's personality, attacks and abilities to progress through an action-packed quest. Use Shrek's ogre strength, Donkey's burro kick and Princess Fiona's ability to slow time.</resource>

    <resource id="493b9b215a24348d04bb83a6a953992fe7100d59" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">In the Game Boy Advance version of Shrek the Third, you must complete levels playing as a combination of Shrek, Prince Artie, Puss in Boots, and Donkey. The levels are mostly puzzles, where you can only access certain areas with a certain character, so all playable characters must work together to all reach the end. Each character has special abilities, such as Shrek's ground pound to break through pits in the ground.

You will encounter many different AI types throughout gameplay, including evil witches, arrow-shooting guys, gnomes, etc. There are collectible faeries in each level that you must collect enough of to progress to the next world. 

This is a simple platformer-puzzle game that is mostly geared towards children, seeing as there are no lives, and relatively simple combat, but it should also appeal to adults who enjoy the Shrek franchise.</resource>

He is suited up with a parasitic suit of armor that gives him enhanced strength and the ability to merge with Krill ships, which are living organisms.  However, he soon discovers that all is not as it seems in this war, and Recker must decide which side he is fighting for.

Sigma Star Saga is a hybrid of the side-scrolling shooter and RPG genres.  Players interact with characters and explore the overworld, and are frequently 'summoned' by random ships for battles.  To successfully complete a battle, the player must defeat a preset amount of enemies, and they gain experience with each enemy defeated.  As players explore the overworld, they can also discover Gun Data, which can be used to customize the player's shot with over 15,000 different weapon combinations using abilities such as rapid fire, vertical shot, and experience gain.</resource>

This title adds numerous features over the original such as the ability of building &amp;quot;light&amp;quot; zones, subways, hospitals, colleges, zoos, and arcos which are actually cities in cities. You can now give names to places, and your city is surrounded by neighboring towns with which you can make trade.

    <resource id="d014415965fbdeb0071339b806380f53c3417f55" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Snood is a puzzle game based on a simple idea, of the kind that was commonplace in the late 1980s. The game is set out with a grid of small differently-coloured shapes, each featuring faces drawn on them. A succession of blocks are placed in an aiming device at the bottom of the screen, and you must rotate this so as to aim them, off the walls if necessary, to hit ones of the same colour.

When 3 or more of the same colour make contact, they are removed from the field of play. Any blocks which were only connected to those blocks (and not to any others or the ceiling) get removed from play as well. This is crucial, because each shot that fails to drop any blocks off causes a meter to move on one level. When this reaches the top, the line of blocks drops by one level. Once it reaches the point where blocks are moved down below the playing area, it is Game Over.

There are five skill levels, as well as a set of 50 challenge levels, and a Journey mode in which you play through one level from each difficulty. From medium difficulty upwards, you'll have to contend with Skulls among the layout - these can only be removed by being dropped away.</resource>

Fire the snoods up to the highest levels, but watch out -- there are no straight sides to bounce off!

Soccer Kid is a platform game with some unique elements.  As the name implies, you have to kill your enemies with your ball. Football-style tricks of keeping the ball in the air and under control are especially useful - headers and overhead kicks can be played with practice. You gain access to the pieces by collecting 11 Player Cards across each world.

There is a saving feature that gives you the ability to save between each country (but not between individual levels).</resource>

Sonic Advance combines elements from the original Sonic series on Sega's Genesis, as well as from the Dreamcast Sonic Adventure series.

Choose from Sonic, Knuckles, Tails, or Amy and take them through level after level of blindingly fast gameplay and ring collecting, dodging enemies in your path towards the final showdown with Dr Robotnik (aka Dr Eggman). 

Collect Chaos Emeralds along the way to transform into Super Sonic for added speed, and train your Chao to exchange them into Sonic Adventure 2 Battle on the Nintendo Gamecube.

And if that wasn't enough, you can also play 4 player battle modes with your mates, using one game cart between 4 GBA's.</resource>

Once again, Sonic is called upon to save the world from the evil Dr. Eggman. On this occasion, Sonic is joined by friends Tails, Knuckles and Cream and rabbit, the latest addition to the Sonic team. Each comes with a set of unique moves, allowing you to reach certain areas through-out the levels. However, unlike Sonic Advance, you must compelte the game as Sonic to unlock the other characters.

Chaos Emeralds and Special Rings litter the stages. To collect the emeralds (transforming Sonic into Super Sonic for the final battle with Dr. Eggman), you must find the special rings hidden in each stage to unlock the bonus stage. Complete the bonus stage and the emerald is yours.

You'll also get the chance to collect and raise chaos, and trade them over to Sonic Adventure 2: Battle on Gamecube, through the use of the GBA/GC link cable.</resource>

Rather than being 3D side-scrolling, the game employs a 3D isometric view that is comprised of actual texture-mapped polygons. The character sprites are 2D.

There are 9 characters to choose from and 5 modes of play: Story, Battle, Challenge, Training, and Mini Games. You can link up 4 GBA's to fight your friends, and each character has several different attacks. It has a system of selecting Aerial, Ground, and Guard based attacks. Depending on what type of attack you set for which area (aerial/ground/guard) you have a possibility of 9 total different special attacks to choose from (only 3 at a time in a match though) which you can change each time you lose 1 stock point.

The game includes a trainable character whose abilities and techniques you can raise and add to. You get to pick and choose every aspect of the robot's style (running, attacking, jumping, dashing, etc.).

The game takes a moderate amount of time to play through as all the characters, and adds a longer lifespan to itself if you wish to play through and beat it completely (all characters, get all moves for the trainable robot, etc).</resource>

The story mode of the game is the usual type of story, Robotnik steals animals visiting Casinopolis, and is going turn into his Robotic slaves. Of course, Sonic is going to try and stop him.

Now, over 20 years later, a new Tank has been created based on the technology recovered during the 1978 invasion.  And none too soon, because the Invaders are back!

Space Invaders is yet another classic arcade game remake by Activision.  (See Battlezone and Asteroids.)  But this time, Activision licensed a game from Taito instead of Atari.  The game stays close to its roots while adding many power-ups and enemies.

You can play either one or two players against the Invaders, who march down the screen in orderly rows and columns, at one of three skill levels.  You'll start at Pluto and work your way through the Solar System to Mars, then Venus, and finally Earth.  There are four common aliens (red, green, blue, and yellow), plus seven more less common ones.  You receive special one shot power-ups by shooting four of the same type of Invaders in a row.  As in the original game, there are also Mother Ships that fly above the action, but in this version if you hit them you can pick up other useful power-ups like shields or double shots.  Plus, after fighting off several waves on each planet, you'll face a unique boss.  If you manage to finish the game, you'll be able to play a reproduction of the original coin-op.</resource>

    <resource id="bcfe1276e8a28c5ffda4f1572be4e9251f597df3" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Spider-Man, the classic comic book co-created by Stan Lee, is now a major motion picture. This conversion of the movie to the video game world takes the major storyline, characters and artwork of the Spider-Man movie and adds a lengthy backstory and new characters.

The Green Goblin is the main villian here, and as Peter Parker you must defy gravity using your spider crawl, web-slinging and spider-sense abilities to track down Spidey's nemesis through the skyscapers of New York City.

The major inclusion for this title over the previous Spider-Man series (on Playstation also by Activision) is aerial combat. Attack the enemy mid-air while web-slinging, rise and decend while swinging and banking around buildings create a greater emphasis on Spidey's greatest asset, the spider web.</resource>

This game also marks the first appearance in a video game by the characters in RUGRATS: ALL GROWN UP. The characters from the popular television shows and evildoers work to move through a number of cartoon settings in order to solve different puzzles in this unique venture. Nicktoons characters are surfacing in places that they don't belong and confusion has followed. Jimmy Neutron, the boy genius has used his advanced intellect to come up with a plan to work through this strange situation. Jimmy has enlisted the help of his fellow Nicktoon friends to get to the bottom of the strange occurrences. The object of the game is to take a picture of each lost character and send them back to their corresponding show. Choose from 8 different Nicktoon characters to search through different shows like HEY ARNOLD, SPONGEBOB SQUAREPANTS, THE FAIRLY ODDPARENTS, AND WILD THORNBERRIES. The game begins with THE FAIRLY ODDPARENTS and progresses to the other show as the player unlocks the levels. Photographers are sent out into each show and the vertical scrolling adventure begins with characters moving onto the screen. New characters can be unlocked with enough points accumulated by taking photos. Fans of Nicktoons and any of the characters featured in this game are in for the most unique treat watching different characters interact in atypical surroundings.</resource>

Assemble your squad, come up with a menacing name, choose a style for your uniforms, and then put your athletes through a rigorous training camp in hopes of fielding the best bunch ever to hit the turf! There are no official licenses to stand in the way of the detailed action, leaving the burden on the game to deliver realistic gameplay at every turn. As your players become more experienced, their skill levels will increase and youâ€™ll get a chance to see new special effects. There are tons of hidden bonuses such as power-ups and stadium improvements to be unlocked throughout the season, and each player is rated for speed agility, and strength. A unique rookie card system rewards all-stars with a little bit of fame, and 3D camera work captures all of the excitement from the opening kickoff to the awards ceremonies. Using a link cable, you can match up against a friend to see who has developed the most competitive team. If realistic football sounds like fun to you, give SPORTS ILLUSTRATED FOR KIDS a try.</resource>

From the distinctive music to the climactic boat transformation, this translation does everything it can to replicate the original coin-op adventure, and loses none of the thrills. Driving the lightning-quick G-6155 Interceptor a vehicle that can switch from car to boat to motorcycle you'll try to destroy the N.O.S.T.R.A. organization before it destroys you. You'll use oil slicks, smoke screens, and missiles to knock your foes off the road, out of the air, and below the surface of the water. This version of SPYHUNTER actually serves as something of an update on the original, as there are seven real-world locales to test your resolve, and the gameplay is now mission based. The graphics have also gotten a bit of an overhaul, with visuals taking place in near 3D. Whether or not you had the pleasure of growing up with this game, there's nothing not to love about one of the original white-knuckle spy games.</resource>

They have always had to worry about dragon slayers, plus they usually get a bad rap for being destructive, and let's not even get started on what people say about their breath! Fortunately Spyro has generally avoided such negative opinions, but then again he hasn't always had it easy either. You'd think that after several death-defying adventures on the Playstation over the past few years, which included the defeat of the evil Sorceress, Spyro and his friends would be able to take some time off and enjoy a bit of a vacation at Dragon Shores. But with evil brewing and a new title on the way for the GameBoy Advance, which is due out in November, the gang shouldn't get too comfortable on the beach.</resource>

For Spyro's fourth appearance on the Game Boy Advance, the development team has given the dragon a more traditional side-scrolling environment for his overworld instead of taking him back to his isometric exploits. But the scrolling platformer is only part of the experience. Spyro Orange focuses on dozens of mini-challenges for its gameplay, like a vertical shooter where Spyro floats around blasting sheep or collecting gems, a rapid-button-tapping challenge involving tug-o-war and ice cube creation, or driving around in a tank, or knocking out a series of bad guys in a Breakout-style challenge. The game supports link cable play for multiplayer challenges.</resource>

1. Shooting
2. Archery
3. Javelin
4. Football
5. Pole Vault
6. Hammer Throw

In the Shooting game, you have to shoot down pairs of clay pigeons that are shot in from the side. You view the event from a third person perspective, and have full control of the cross hair. The rest of the events are different. They all use timing meters, one for strength and one for accuracy, where the player has to hit the button at the right spot on the meter. 

Two game modes are available. Practice is the first, where one player can play any of the events at any time, without going through the rest. The second is the tournament where one or two players sharing the same machine can go through all the events. For each event the player will earn points, and there is a high score table for overall scores.</resource>

    <resource id="33c1a4c2bb1d020a280b1c469d1c8b0ee4cb633d" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Street Fighter Alpha 3, the third game in the Alpha series, has a total of 31 fighters, the most in the series so far. New characters include old favorites E. Honda, Blanka, Vega, Cammy, T. Hawk, Dee Jay, Juni and Juli. Some of the newest fighters on the block include a former Final Fight character (Cody, who has been in jail since the last Final Fight game, or so his clothing suggests), Karin Kanzuki and Rainbow Mika.

The major difference between this Alpha and the last two are the new play modes World Tour, Arcade, VS, Training and Entry. 

World Tour - Simply choose your fighter and travel around the world, fighting the home town heroes that you run into. The more fights you win, the stronger you fighter becomes. You can also learn new moves, and there are three levels of Super moves to choose from before you start each round (called Isms).

Arcade - A simple conversion of the arcade version. Beat each fighter with your chosen warrior, in three rounds per match (much the same as past versions of Street Fighter)

Versus - Two human players battle it out. 

Training - A good way to learn all the super moves that are available, against a dummy.

Entry - If you save your character during the World Tour mode, you can upload him here to use in the other modes in the game (especially handy for Training).

Finally, if you complete certain areas of the game three new fighters become available, including another old favourite in Guile, Evil Ryu and Shin Akuma.</resource>

You can also play against a friend in the various multiplayer modes to see who has the best control over their car.</resource>

As you throw them down the line, they will stack up in piles of six. Linking three bubbles together will pop them (remove them from the field), and if there is a stack of six, the bubbles on the way will form a new stack in front of it.

The aim of the game is to remove all bubbles from the field, but there is another way of completing a game. Tokens will appear during play, and by collecting enough, you can move on to the next round regardless of what you have on the playfield.</resource>

The aim of the game, as with the previous titles in the series, is to remove a collected number of coloured bubbles from the game screen. To do so, at the bottom of the screen, you aim and fire the coloured bubbles from a launcher, sending the bubbles upwards into the container. Match three or more together of the same colour to clear them from the screen. If you're too slow, the collection of bubbles moves down the screen towards you, and the game will end if it reaches the bottom.

Classic mode features a number of bubble puzzles previously seen in the Bust-A-Move series, while Normal mode has some new variations on the bubble removing theme. Two players can also compete against each other.</resource>

    <resource id="b4ca10b1abb3e0d50e2db4f8cd916f3c8061777f" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">The game concept is that you have to eliminate clusters of at least 3 blocks with your mouse, but the more you remove at once, the more you score. Once that happens, all blocks above the ones, which have vanished, will fall down and close the gap.

Beneath the lowest row, there you see the new row building up. Once all blocks are present, this row will be now the lowest row, while all others are moving up. Once one block reaches the top of the playfield, you loose.

Each individual level has a preset value of rows, which will build up. To win a level, all you have to do, is to prevent that a full vertical row (from bottom to top) gets stacked up.

The game offers 4 game modes: Traditional, Puzzle, Relapse, and Strategy. Two of them need a brain, while the other two just need a fast hand.

Traditional works like explained above. New rows show automatically, with increasing speed not only from level to level, but also in a level. Means: the level starts slow, but in the end, new rows will complete every second. Power-Ups are available in this game mode.

Relapse works exactly like Traditional, but with one major difference. The action isn't just limited to the bottom of the playfield, in fact, both bottom and top now filling with blocks. Power-Ups used on one side affecting both. How to win is the same, but you loose, when blocks from one side touching the other.

Strategy is one of the two game modes where you must think. Clicking fast will only help to see the Game Over screen. New rows won't appear automatically, instead for each cluster you remove, a full new line will appear. So you have to plan carefully before neutralizing a cluster.

Puzzle is the game mode, where no new lines appear. Also there are no Power-Ups here. But this is the most complex game mode. Your task is to completely remove all blocks, if at least one block is still available, you loose. There is also no time limit, so you can think as long as you want.

The first three game modes offering bonus levels, which works like the Puzzle mode. So, if one block remains, you only scoring the normal points for removed clusters. Only when all blocks are removed, you score the bonus points. There are only two differences: it isn't so complex, and you only have 15 seconds time.

There are 5 different Power-Ups in the game (2 good, 2 bad, 1 depending of the situation): Platform Block (won't move, just blocking the vertical row where it is), Indestructible Block (does move like a regular block, but can't removed with normal actions), Color Bomb (one of each of the 5 colors, will detonate all same colored blocks in it's big radius), Super Bomb (shorter range than the Color Bomb, but blow up all blocks, regardless the color; only way to remove Platform/Indestructible Blocks), and finally, the Gravity Block (only available in Relapse Mode, will shift all blocks from the side where it was activated to the other side).</resource>

In this case, the Princess is transformed into a ball and launched from a Super Mario 64-style cannon, which a pair of goombas aim directly at Bowser's Castle. Mario is also transformed into a ball and chases after her.

There are 5 levels, each consisting of a set of pinball tables. Each table has some exits (including the one below the flippers) that Mario can use to move to other tables. Also, each one holds a star, normally obtained by defeating all enemies on the table. Some exits require that Mario has a certain number of stars. To gain access to Bowser's castle, Mario must defeat the bosses of the first 4 levels, which gives him star keys. The game also features a &amp;quot;Time Attack&amp;quot; mode, which allows players to fight already defeated bosses again.</resource>

Play monkey bowling (aka ten pin bowling), monkey fight (knock the other 3 players' monkey ball out of the circle arena) or an 18 hole mini golf challenge.</resource>

Take control of your favourite turtle ninjas as you play through the events of the 2007 CGI movie. The turtles have grown apart, and Raphael has taken to crime fighting solo under the guise of the Nightwatcher.  The Foot Clan are turning up in the streets again, and a mysterious man known as Winters seems to be involved with them. Only the Ninja Turtles can clean up the streets!

The Game Boy Advance version of TMNT can be best described as similar to the NES game River City Ransom.  Players take control of either a specific turtle or the turtle of their choice (depending on the mission), and fight through waves of enemies in a sidescrolling beat-em-up style.  Enemies will drop the usual health pickups, but also drop money and weaponry.  Money can be used to purchase weapons or upgrades between missions, while weapons can be used as a more powerful tool to defeat your foes (however, these weapons have a limited use).  After the completion of a mission, experience is earned, and after a certain amount of experience is gained, you can level up the turtles to improve their fighting statistics.

Each turtle has their own specific weapon: Leonardo with his dual Katana, Michelangelo with his Nunchucks, Donatello with his Bo Staff and Raphael with his two Sai.  These weapons are used in their standard attacks.  A basic attack is performed with the B Button, but you can perform different attacks with B and other buttons such as the directions of the Control Pad and the A Button.  Uppercuts, Sweep Kicks, Jump Kicks and more can be performed, and you can even juggle enemies in the air to get more hits in and increase your score.</resource>

The main characters, Frio and Kyaro, and their aquaintance Professor Brown, who lives there, have long admired the legendary heroes.

The ruins of an ancient super-civilization were found in a crack in the ground caused by an earthquake several years ago. Frio and Kyaro visit Professor Brown, who's studying and repairing some of the artifacts found in the ruins.

Among the relics is a timeship, a craft capable of transcending time and space. Its function is to travel space-time to keep in touch with the legends of the world. The restoration is finally completed by the triumphant Professor Brown.

Each turtle (Leonardo, Michelangelo, Raphael &amp; Donatello) has their own set of levels to complete, with their own distinct moves and combat options to use during battle. Along with a set of side-scrolling levels, complete with end of level boss battles, the four turtles will also get the chance to race through the sewers in the unique 3rd person race modes, shooting down the enemy or collecting items, while Donatello takes to the sky in the Shell Glider and Raphael challenges Casey Jones to a one-on-one cycle race.</resource>

Players have the choice of eight different competitors and four different alleys. Ten Pin Alley 2's gameplay is a four click affair: first, mark the spot on the lane you want to stand. Then, watch the aim arrow bounce back and forth on the alley. Hit the button again, and set the power of the throw. The fourth button click sets how much or little a hook you want to throw. Released on a 32 megabit Game Boy Advance cartridge, the game was based on the cell phone game of the same name.</resource>

Drop different shaped blocks into the container, and fit them together to form a horizontal line, and the line disappears. Your job is to keep going as long as possible by clearing the container of blocks.

This will be the first time on a Game Boy System that 4 players can play multiplayer Tetris, which is much the same as the original Tetris, only that when you clear a line of blocks, the line(s) appear in another players screen.</resource>

The game is played from a third person perspective and uses Sennari Interactive's ray tracing engine from Driver 2. The cast of the game are all characters from the Tin Pin Alley series of bowling games. The game features two game modes: Practice Race, which is just the player racing around as he wishes, and Tournament Race, where the player competes against AI-controlled drivers. Throughout the game's tracks, the player will come across power ups that boosts the speed of the player car and obstacles that hinder it like for example oil which causes the car to spin around. There's four different tracks in the game, each with its own layout and appearance, although the difference between them is very small.</resource>

    <resource id="0196270f924a0581b8d11608de448f88806eb2c2" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Based on the live action film released in 2004 (which in turn was based on the 1960s series starring marionettes), Thunderbirds stars Alan, Tin-Tin, and Fermat, three children whose guardians are part of the International Rescue team. The player takes control of all three children as they go through training and are then forced to travel around the world to save members of International Rescue from an evil villain known as The Hood.

The game takes place in locales such as the International Rescue island, Africa, and even outer space. Each of the three characters has his or her own unique abilities that the player must use to solve puzzles and advance through a level. Alan has strength and jumping ability, Tin-Tin has telekinetic powers that are used to move objects, and Fermat can hack computers and roll through holes. While the majority of the gameplay is primarily composed of solving puzzles from an overhead view, there are also flight action sequences where the player can fly one of the many vehicles known as the Thunderbirds.</resource>

The biggest addition to this version is EA's Game Face, which lets you customize everything and anything.  You have the basics, such as hair, skin, facial hair and other general appearances, but Game Face allows you to customize every other aspect, from teeth shape, logos, tattoos, headbands, hats, and more.  You may also change individual body mass, muscle tone, mid-section, arms and legs.  You also have the option of choosing specific swing style animations, post-putt and celebration animations, and &amp;quot;pissed off&amp;quot; animations for when you score a triple bogey.

One of the new modes is World Tour, which puts you through a standard 52-week PGA tour to earn money, sponorships, and better gear.  You can play for up to twenty seasons.  The other new game mode is Battle Golf, where you can win an opponent's clubs if you beat them.  All the other standard game modes are here, from Skill Challenge and Speed Golf to a Skins Match or Practice.

A new feature is the game's ability to read your console's internal clock, and provide you with game modes.  If it's near the end of October and your clock is properly set, you may be invited to a Halloween event where you can win items specific to that event.

All top PGA players are included for you to play as (or against), including Vijay Singh and Justin Leonard.  Newcomers to the sport have also been added, such as John Daly.

Most of the courses from 2003 have made it, with seven new courses, both real and fantasy.  One of the new courses is Bethpage Black, an extremely difficult course located in Washington.

Like all other 2004 EA Sports console games, Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2004 has the EA Sports Bio, which tracks your accomplishments and games over all EA Sports titles.  The more EA Sports games you play, and the longer you play them, will increase your EA Gamer Level and unlock additional rewards, such as a new driver in Tiger Woods or historic teams in NHL 2004.  This feature isn't on the PC version.

Gamers who buy the PlayStation 2 version will be able to play online through EA's matchmaking service.  You cannot play online with the Xbox or GameCube versions.

If you buy the GameCube version, you can use the GameBoy Advance to hook up to the GameCube to unlock special rewards not available through normal play.</resource>

Any fan of the classic cartoon series will go nuts for the near-perfect animation and familiar humor of the television show, but this game goes far beyond the call of duty. Between the long list of well-loved characters and the intense combat design, TINY TOON ADVENTURES: Buster's Bad Dream ranks among the Game Boy Advance elite. Make your way through four unique environments including Acme Forest, Haunted Mansion, Space Station, and a surprise locale partnering up with other Toons to destroy the likes of Elmyra, Montana Max, and many others. Babs Bunny, Dizzy Devil, Buster, and all the rest of the gang appear throughout, and there are plenty of hidden areas and personalities to unlock. The game's team system is such that one player can stun or distract an enemy, opening the door for the other player to inflict serious damage. The relationship between cartoon characters and violence dates back a ways, and TINY TOON ADVENTURES isn't about to break up the love affair.</resource>

You get one undeniably awesome game. Buster Bunny, Plucky Duck, and the rest of the TINY TOONS crew are ready for fun, and you're in the driver's seat. The basic premise of this addicting, original title is to arrange pairs of colored eggs, dropping them onto the screen to create combinations. Of course, there are numerous obstacles and would-be detractors to make things more difficult (UFOs, Tasmanian Devils), and time is never on your side. There are plenty of characters from the animated series along for the adventure including Hampton J. Pig and Fifi La Fume and each is prepared for puzzle-style battle. As many as four players can link up to see who has the quickest reflexes, and there are plenty of single-player modes to keep you busy as well. If you're a TINY TOONS fan, this one is a must-have. If you're not a fan well, you should be.</resource>

It simulates football matches through players taking turns to throw dice for attack and defense moves. Combinations are formed through multiple throws of three blue dice (attack). Further gameplay also involves a white one (more risk through double or nothing), a green one, and a red one (defense). The concept borrows some elements from poker dice with risk assessment based on retaining dice after the first throw. The gameplay involves different types of shots, but also penalties and foul cards (causing a player to wait a turn).</resource>

Gameplay is similar to the console titles, meaning you explore different metropolitan areas and look for other car fans to challenge them to races. Players race through three cities- Tokyo, London and Los Angeles-on six different tracks. There are more than 60 different rivals to challenge.</resource>

Unfortunately, just after the machine is unveiled, the TV of a boy named Demiru blows out. The adventure begins when you take control of Demiru, and set out to have your TV repaired...&amp;quot;

Tomato Adventure is a very cute and unique RPG meant for young kids, and is currently only available in Japan. It's fairly simple compared to the more complex RPGs out there. But I still think it's very fun; it reminds me a lot of Super Mario RPG.</resource>

    <resource id="7091e930b01dc09aef6d5e2f8ec19a31fcdaa822" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">The Tony Hawk skateboarding series makes its debut on the Game Boy Advance with this adaptation of the second Pro Skater game.

Gameplay is similar to the original console game. The levels have been adapted from the console version for the two dimensional isometric perspective; one is even taken from the original Tony Hawk's Pro Skater.

In Career Mode, choose from one of 13 professional skaters and, in each level, complete various goals like collecting items, performing special tricks and of course breaking high scores by performing tricks and combos. Completing the goals earns money which unlocks new levels and can be spent on new boards, tricks and upgrading your skater's stats. In competition levels, you don't skate for money but compete for a medal.

In the Free Skate and Single Session modes, unlocked levels can be practiced and new high scores be established.</resource>

The line-up of street and vert riders include Elissa Steamer, Jamie Thomas, Steve Caballero, Rune Glifberg, Geoff Rowley, Andrew Reynolds, Rodney Mullen, Eric Koston, Chad Muska, Bucky Lasek and Bam Margera from MTV's Jackass (and Tony Hawk, of course).

The create a skater mode returns, allowing for even further levels of options for your character, like adding glasses and tatoos to changing the colour of the knee and elbow pads or even the hair.

And the levels themselves that you must skate through are now more interactive, with cars and humans blocking paths and making noise as you race around to make as many points as possible. Use items around the streets or the park to jump from or over to increase your score, and pull of as many wild and wacky tricks as you can.</resource>

The main feature of this game is it's redesigned career mode.  When beginning a level, you have all the time in the world to skate around, perform tricks, get a feel for the level, without the hassel of any goals or time limits.  When you're ready to attempt a goal, simply find a pro skater, talk to him, then receive the goal, similar to Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX.  Goals are similar to the previous games, such as collect SKATE, get a certain amount of points, transfer over this and grind that.  There are new goals, however, such as collecting the word COMBO while doing one big combo.  Miss a trick, and goal fails.  Once all regular goals are accomplished, you can attempt the Pro Goal, which is specific to each skater, and is extremely hard.

All the major skaters are here, including Tony Hawk, Bob Burnquist, Steve Caballero, Kareem Campbell, Rune Gilfberg, Eric Koston, Bucky Lasek, Bam Margera, Rodney Mullen, Chad Muska, Andrew Reynolds, Geoff Rowley, Elissa Steamer and Jamie Thomas.

The levels are been expanded and are huge.  Some of the levels include a college campus, a shipyard, and the infamous prison complex Alcatraz.

For multiplayer, all the favorite modes are back, from Graffiti and Trick Attack to Horse and King Of The Hill.  New modes include Capture The Flag and Combo Mambo.  THPS4 also supports System Link play, but not XBox Live.

The PlayStation 2 version offers everything from the XBox version, but also has online play, utilizing either your own network adaptor or the official one.  The PS2 version also features a one level demo of Shaun Murray's Pro Wakeboarder, which is not featured on any other version of the game.</resource>

Like the previous GBA releases of the series, it's an isometric representation of the console levels combined with polygonal characters.  It contains both a story mode, in which you create a rookie skater and take him or her on a world tour with pros to improve their skills and win prizes; and a classic mode, in which you must accomplish various goals such as tricking off objects or getting a high score within two minutes.  Changes in this iteration include removing the timer from most goals in story mode, allowing you to have several active at once and new moves like the nata spin, tantrum, which allows you to recover from a bail without losing everything, focus, where you can slow time in order to land the best trick and sticker-slapping.</resource>

The game features two main game modes: quick race and championship. In quick race, players can alone, against another human player or create custom courses for the game. This is further divided into versus games against the computer and time attack. The game can also connect through mobile phones to check global rankings, enter local ranking entries, and download ghosts and new courses.

In the championship mode, players need to complete the courses in a fixed order while a ranking is kept. The cars are shown from a third-person perspective and there are different AI-controlled racers to beat. Prior to the races, players can do free runs, qualify and eventually start the race or tune the car further. There are two weather types, sunny and rainy, which affects the handling of the cars.

There are different cars and courses to choose from, with extensive tuning options based on the gear ratio, steering, brakes, tires, aerodynamic settings and the height handicap. There are also three difficulty levels.</resource>

The game contains exciting tennis gameplay, a number of different modes, and a lot of fun. Career mode, the main mode of the game, has players creating a male or female character from scratch using the game's fairly deep customization mode. Once their player is created and named, gamers move to the court. First comes several training rounds with the coach, who will teach players everything then need to know about controlling their character, serving, and returning the ball in TOP SPIN 2. However, each lesson costs money, so players will need to quickly enter a low-level tournament to earn some cash. Many of the tournaments won't be available at the beginning, but as players win matches and earn rankings, more difficult tournaments will open up. Eventually, players will find themselves facing off against big name tennis stars like Andy Roddick, Venus Williams, Roger Federer, Maria Sharapova, Lindsay Davenport, and Lleyton Hewitt. Gamers can also play quick games as either singles or doubles, play an exhibition match, play three different mini-games in party mode, and take on friends using the Game Boy Advance link. Overall, players who love tennis and the challenge it brings will love TOP SPIN 2.</resource>

On a rainy night, Nangou is gambling to try and pay off a large life insurance debt, and losing badly. Suddenly, a 13 year old boy appears at the door. Needing a break, Nangou lies to the yakuza he is playing with, claiming he asked the young man to check on him if he hadn't left by midnight. As the game progresses Nangou plans to give up a worthwhile hand to avoid taking a risk, he is stopped by the young boy who tells him, &amp;quot;you won't survive unless you die&amp;quot;. This change in attitude slowly tilts the game in Nagous favor. During the next break, Nangou asks the young boy, named Akagi Shigeru, to play for him in the coming Han-Chan sessions. This would mark the beginning of the mahjong legend, Akagi.</resource>

Choose from four up and coming riders, and compete in the Ibex, Glyder and Kotsu Leagues to become the ultimate champion!

Trick Star is a futuristic racing game where the racers ride slick one-wheeled bikes. Players race along the track, with the goal of not only coming first, but also performing stunts to impress the crowds. Stunts cannot be performed until a certain speed is reached, and the &amp;quot;Trick Star&amp;quot; appears on the HUD. When it appears, players can perform a stunt by holding L or R, as well as any direction on the Control Pad. Performing stunts also fills your boost meter - when it is full, you can press L and R simultaneously to get an extra boost.

In League Mode, players must complete three tracks, as well as scoring enough points to qualify for the Challenge Mode. Once the player has enough points, they can enter Challenge Mode, where they are asked to perform a particular set of stunts in between markers. When they succeed, they are rewarded with additional stunts and progress to the next set of tracks.

Trick Star also includes one player at a time multiplayer, for up to four players. Players can compete in Time Trial (aim for the fastest time), Stunts (get the highest stunt point score), Long Jump (jump the longest distance along the track) and Challenges (complete the required challenges). After each player has had a go, the results are shown.</resource>

Tringo was developed first by Nathan Keir within Second Life, a virtual world that encourages players to create their own content. Brought to the GBA, this handheld version is optimized for portable play for quick play and multiplayer gaming.</resource>

    <resource id="460117ec99da250a4a3273d54c145d74460fdd76" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Turbo Turtle Adventure is a puzzle adventure game similar to Marble Madness where the player guides a rolling turtle through different platform like mazes. Played from a top down perspective, the player has to control his turtle throughout the levels without falling over the edge. There's seven different levels in total and includes a jungle, volcano and a space station. 

There's a number of power ups or items available that are necessary to complete a challenge. First of all the player ha to fins keys to unlock doors. These come in different colors that have to match. Some tiles have arrows on them which force the player in the direction they face. To overcome this the player can use his turbo speed. Some of the ground is weak and can collapse when rolling over it. Often the player will come across gaps. For this there's a build item and a jump item. There's also gravity and wind which drag or push the the player. The turtle's shell can be upgraded in three ways. There's a glide shell which allows the player to go faster over slow ground, the panzer shell which allows the player to pass through force fields and the spike shell which allows the player to get a better grip on slippery ground such as ice.</resource>

On earth during the old west, Tal'Set faces off his enemy, Captain Bruckner and succeeds in cutting off his arm, but both of them are sucked into a wormhole. Tal'Set is nearly killed and the people of the River Village, who found him, call upon Tarkeen to heal him. Tarkeen then commands them to bring Tal'Set to him. He is sent into the jungle and kills enemy factions, lizard-like enemies known as the Sleg, that are close to the Village. Tal'Set hooks up with Genn, a pilot from the Village, who will be guiding him to the seer. Along the way, he uses the Pterosaur to evict the Sleg from the jungle and destroy their air ship.</resource>

The GBA title follows the exact story structure of the console platformer, right down to the still screens lifted out of the animated cutscenes. Gameplay-wise, Ty 2 is a traditional platformer that puts heavy emphasis on boomerang action. Players control Ty through huge levels that go all over the map; up, down, left, right... and each location and situation on the handheld is based specifically on the same location and situation in the console. The sprite graphics of Ty and his pals have been rendered from the 3D assets of the console bigger brother to retain a consistent feel throughout the game design. There are elements that are original to the GBA game; character profiles during conversations, for example, are supplied by drawn stills unique to the handheld game.</resource>

The GBA game puts players in control of the web-slinging Spider-Man as he does battle with Venom and other enemies while getting help from some familiar superheroes. The story of Spider-Man begins when 15 year old Peter Parker is bitten by a radioactive spider. He soon realizes he has the ability to climb walls and to sense things. Shortly after being bitten, Peter and friend Eddie Brock discover a mysterious black suit that their fathers created before their deaths. Eddie ends up putting on the suit, which turns him into the powerful villain known as Venom. Peter must battle his childhood friend and other villains like the Green Goblin, Carnage, and Electro to save the city. In story mode, players can walk around New York City as much as they wish as they accomplish side-missions or move the plot along. Instead of walking, though, Spider-Man can shoot webs onto tall buildings and swing his way around the city while capturing gang members and stopping crimes. He also must stop Venom's plot and defeat the other villains. Players will also enjoy seeing Spider-Man joined by allies like Wolverine and the Human Torch for some scenes. Fans of the comics will enjoy how ULTIMATE SPIDER-MAN draws on the comic style and storyline, while movie fans will like getting to see another chapter in the Spider-Man legacy.</resource>

Three of the sports renditions, skiing, snowboarding, and bobsled, utilize an ambitious 3D engine for a realistic you-are-there feel. In Skiing, players rush down the different slopes in order to beat the best time, while Snowboarding requires players to pull off tricks to score points. Bobsled puts players in the ice-riding vehicle, where they must keep the sled on the optimal groove of the course to get the fastest time and Curling is like ice bowling or shuffleboard. Features 10 courses for each event and link-up play for two.</resource>

Players can customize the entire game setup based on the number of players, individual customization, game type, number of cards, alternate cards and house rules. The predefined game types include:

1. Endless: no win conditions and endless rounds. Between each round chips, pot wins, first-out wins and poker hand wins are shown.
2. Chips: earn 50 to 500 to win. Players start with 25 chips and can go into debt.
3. Uno Wins: win 1 to 10 rounds by going out first.
4. Poker Wins: win 1 to 10 rounds with a poker hand.
5. Pot Wins: win the pot in 1 to 10 rounds.
6. Survival: extra ante based on the number of players still at the table. Players who lose all their chips are eliminated.

There are also four special modes available:

1. Challenge Mode: play five unique or randomly-generated levels with different win conditions.
7. Endurance Mode: maximize the score without running out of chips.
8. Timed Mode: earn as much as possible before time runs out.
9. Solitaire Mode: play all cards in a twist on the classic Solitaire card game.

All the classic cards are available as well as the alternate poker rules for cards. Wireless multiplayer is supported for up to four players for the DS version, which is generally a port of the GBA release with stretched screens and ported sound. The number 52 in the title refers to the included game variation.</resource>

Starting out as a humble window washer, the player is quickly embroiled in a devious plot by the greedy tycoon Daddy Bigbucks to take over the city.

The story is much stronger this time around, with the player exploring three colorful city environments, including the New Orleans-influenced SimQuarter, the shiny Glasstown district, the gritty Urbania, and even a haunted bayou inhabited by two creepy Cajun brothers.

In addition to the traditional Sims gameplay of satisfying motives, making friends, and decorating an apartment, the player can experience eight job minigames, a &amp;quot;xizzle&amp;quot; system that lets players learn special abilities, and several new vehicles, including a motorcycle, hoverboard, and fanboat. Combine all that with a wacky sense of humor, and you get The Urbz: Sims in the City.</resource>

Battles in the game are played in real time from a top-down perspective, not unlike Zelda. You can attack with your equipped weapons and perform small combos, rushing and charged attacks. When a character runs out of HP, it turns into a ball. Whoever manages to knock the ball into a pit scores a point. While in ball form, characters can roll around and dodge attacks until the normal form is recovered. Succeeding in this, however, cuts a part of the character's life bar, making continued survival more difficult.</resource>

When trouble appears, the citizens of Bumblyburg call world-famous crime fighter LarryBoy! Aided only by his trusted butler Alfred (played with zest by Archibald Asparagus), LarryBoy is everything that his alter-ego Larry the Cucumber is not: bold... confident... relentlessly driven... brazenly heroic! Well, actually, that's not entirely true. While he tries to create this impression, inside, LarryBoy is still plain-old Larry. LarryBoy attempts to save the day with clever use of his super-suction ears and the many features of the Larry-Mobile. Call him a kinder, gentler, slightly slower superhero!</resource>

Choose from a male or female player (or create your own) and take to the world tour, competing in various tournaments on clay, hardcourt, grass or indoors. Play against some of the best players in the world, both in singles and doubles, or compete against your friends in 4 player doubles.

Mini-games test your skills and improves the timing of your shots. Games range from Burger Chef (aim at the grid to decide what comes next on the burger), Disc Shooter (similar to Othello) and Bull's Eye, where you aim for the center of the target. Your created character will also improve depending on your success in each mini-game, with his or her stats increasing over time.</resource>

Luckily, or unluckily for him, a small town is nearby. Calling in for help, he find the people of Big Piney more then happy to help ... at a price. Wade must now strap on the boxing gloves and fight his way around the town against a range of strange characters ready to punch his lights out. To make enough money to fix the car, and make it out of the town alive, he'll be put to the test in and out of the ring.

The non-linear style of the game leaves you with all the options. You will choose who to fight, who to trust to make the right business decisions, and who your hard earned money should be spent on to purchase their help at a time of crisis in the ring. Wade's life and his car rest in your gloved hands.</resource>

A rider (using a board that's like a combination of a surf board, body board and skateboard) is pulled along the water by rope at high speeds by the boat up front, and must pull of tricks either by jumping of jumps or using the wake left by the boat itself (hence the sports name).

Unleashed takes this sport and turns it upside down, allowing you to fly down water ways through well known locations around the world, pulling stunts off buildings or cliff faces. Other objectives are included that have you completing tasks and busting tricks in a unique way.

Multiplayer modes include one-on-one trick attack and horse, where both players compete against each other to pull off the best tricks.</resource>

At the screen you have a 5x4 grid of holes (3x3 in the GBA version). As the game begins, moles will randomly pop up their heads in the holes. Now you have to hit them before they disappear again. DS users will use the stylus and tap the moles, while GBA users will have to use the directional pad to move a marker around the screen.

The game comes with three different game modes. The first is the arcade mode, were you for each level has to reach a certain amount of points before the time goes out. Different types of mole will show up. In addition to the standard mole, there's the golden mole which gives four times as much points as the standard one, and the plush one which gives minus points. Later in the game, you will also meet moles that attack your score, for example ninja and bazooka moles. Various power ups are also available. We have the multipliers, which  once active will give you double points for each mole, clocks that slows the time and bombs that do the opposite. Seven worlds are available, each with it's own graphical theme.</resource>

The story is similar to that of Harry Potter, only this time the main character is a fairy. She gets to go to a fairy school in fairytale world called Magix where she has to find her true self. This game is similar to the Windows and Playstation 2 versions, except that instead of a 3D third person perspective it features a 2D top-down perspective of the game world.

This game loosely retells the story of the first season of the television series.

There are &amp;quot;action&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;adventure&amp;quot;levels. In the adventure levels gameplay consists of finding items for specific NPCs and playing various mini-games. In the action levels the player has to jump, climb and fight enemies. The main character, Bloom, has a magic shield and two attacks that improve during the game. She can also cast a number of spells that can aid her in finding the items she needs. During boss battles Bloom changes to her Winx form in which she is more powerful and can fly. During the levels there are various items to be picked up which improve Blooms health or attacks or unlock new outfits that can be worn.</resource>

The Terran Confederation, slowly demobilizing and reorganizing its military assets, has settled on a new strategy: building several Midway-class megacarriers, brainchild of Navy Commodore Christopher Blair. These new carriers, over a kilometer long, carry all the hardware and weaponry of a Kilrathi-War-era carrier battle group. The first one, the Midway herself, is undergoing her shakedown cruise, with Blair along for the ride. Before this, though, the player is treated to a CGI video of a bizarre rupture in space in the Kilrah system: the first of the Nephilim invaders.

The missions usually come in three flavors: Top-down view bombing missions where you have to take out strategically important targets, isometric strafing runs where you get to blast anything that you fancy blasting with an unlimited supply of ammo, and of course the main part: Dogfights in the sky. Rendered in 3D, seems from behind your head.

The game is set in the years 1916 through 1918, and to loosen things up a little, we get to read a page of our character's new entry for the diary-like journal in his company between every mission.</resource>

    <resource id="cc9053326f46c9af5edfdde6ad2c5a8f54e3abb1" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Inspired by the top-down infiltration game Castle Wolfenstein, this episodic first-person shooter (FPS) puts the player in the boots of  B.J. Blazkowicz, an allied spy. There are six episodes (the first distributed complete as shareware), the second, and the third available after registration and the three final missions (which happen before the events of the first episode) available in the &amp;quot;Nocturnal Missions&amp;quot; pack. However, they do not need to be played in sequence to be enjoyed!

In the first episode (Escape from Wolfenstein), B.J. was captured, but overpowered a guard with the help of a concealed knife and managed to get out of his cell. Throughout the next nine levels the player guides B.J. searching for an escape from Wolfenstein, guarded by Hans Grosse. After returning to Allied territory, B.J. is given the instructions to Operation: Eisenfaust, where he has to stop Dr. Schabbs and his army of mutant prototypes before they are released into the battlefields. The final mission (Die, Führer, Die!) has a simple goal: infiltrate the bunker under the Reichstag, and terminate Hitler (in a robotic suit) himself. The Nocturnal Missions are focused on the Nazi plans for chemical warfare, and start with Dark Secret, where B.J. hunts for lead researcher Dr. Otto Giftmacher. It's followed by Trail of the Madman, where the goal is capturing the war plans guarded by Gretel Grosse, and the final episode Confrontation, where B.J. meets General Fettgesicht, the planner for the chemical assault.

Each episode has nine levels (eight regular and a final boss level), plus a secret level activated by an hidden switch somewhere in the eight first levels. Regular levels often feature a maze-like appearance or large areas with many enemies (the number of them on each area depends on the difficulty level), where the player must reach the exit elevator. To do so, he must kill the enemies (while it's possible to move behind the guards' backs and even there's a slight bonus in attacking them from behind, most enemies have to be dealt with by fire power), and depending on the level, activate &amp;quot;push walls&amp;quot; and/or get silver and golden keys to open certain doors.

Many objects can be found in a level, from medikits, chicken meals, and even dog food (to restore health), ammo and treasures, which solely exist for points. There are four weapons (knife, pistol, machine gun and Gatling), all of them using the same bullets except the knife. The knife and the pistol are given at the start of the level, while the machine gun is either found (usually in secret areas) or picked up from SS troopers and the Gatling is always dropped somewhere in the level. There are five kinds of enemies (excluding bosses) - Dogs (fast, but more a nuisance than life-threatening), Army Soldiers (dressed in regular brown outfit, not very powerful but usually found in large groups), Officers (dressed in white, armed with a very accurate pistol and tough to kill), SS Troopers (blue attire, armed with a machine gun and tough to kill), and Mutants (the rarest and toughest of regular enemies, pale-skinned troopers with green clothes and a machine gun stuck in their chest).

Unlike modern FPS games, the player has a number of lives and once the player loses the last life, the game ends. To win extra lives, the player has to either find the 1-up item in the level or get 20,000 points (by killing enemies and capturing treasures or completing a level below the 'par' time while killing all enemies, finding all secrets by pushing walls, and collecting all treasure points).</resource>

    <resource id="bd2f7f4deb25779f5788ca24ba3926961790f624" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">The gameplay is similar to that of Puzzle Bobble/Bust-A-Move, but with several key differences. There is a hexagonal grid of coloured blocks at the top of the screen, while the player's character sits on a boat floating in water. Unlike Puzzle Bobble, it is able to move side to side. There are multiple weapons that can be used, however the only weapon the player has to start with is a bazooka. As with Worms, holding down the fire button increases the power behind the weapon's launch, affecting how far it will travel. It is possible to fire the bazooka (and some other weapons, such as the grenade and dynamite) in an &amp;quot;arch&amp;quot;, allowing players to reach difficult areas.

Shooting blocks will have one of two effects:

If you hit a block that is either the same colour as your bazooka missile, or is a rainbow block, that block and any other same-coloured or rainbow blocks connected to it will be destroyed. Any blocks that are not the same colour will not be affected; however, if the only thing holding those blocks up is the coloured blocks you have just destroyed, those blocks will fall into the water.

If you hit a block that is a different colour from your bazooka missile, or is a &amp;quot;dead block&amp;quot; - an uncoloured, grey block - it will be recoloured to match the missile.

(Weapons are affected differently by other blocks. This is covered further below.)</resource>

You're going to learn that there's nothing more dangerous than a Worm with a bazooka or a shotgun...

At first sight, Worms World Party may seem very similar to Worms Armageddon. However, this time the game has been specially designed with multiplayer in mind. Up to 6 players can battle out at the same time on local networks or on the internet, using Team17 own matchmaking service, called Wormnet.

Other welcomed additions are the Wormpot, which can provide 400 gameplay variations from &amp;quot;Goliath Mode&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;Bleeding Worms&amp;quot;, hundreds of new landscapes, flags and fanfares, and a load of single player missions.</resource>

Led by the young emperor Gulcasa, who seized control of the Empire in a brutal coup d?etat, Bronchia's Imperial Army cuts a bloody swath through the people of Fantasinia and the Royal Armies of King Ordeene. Amidst the chaos, a young woman escapes from the besieged capital of Partina -- a woman with innocence in her face, and a sword in her hand. The girl?s name is Princess Yggdra, the last surviving member of the royal family; the sword is the Gran Centurio, a legendary blade once wielded by the founder of Fantasinia, and passed down through generations of royalty.

The Spirit who loves Surprises showed up and told Yoshi the dinosaur there is a way to bring Yoshi's Island back.

It's up to Yoshi to save the day in Yoshi Topsy-Turvy. The game is divided into six chapters, each containing numerous stages. The player will have to tilt the world (using the tilt sensor) to help Yoshi climb walls, open new paths, and send enemies rolling away. Happiness Medals should be earned, allowing the player to move on to the next chapter if Yoshi successfully clears certain objectives that the Spirits ask of him. Along the way, Yoshi will be transformed into a ship, a ball, and a balloon.</resource>

The game also has a text translation utility that will allow gamers who link with one another to translate text automatically between languages.  The languages included are Japanese, French, Spanish, German, Italian, and English.  These are also the languages you can view the game in.

The game continues the tradition of the Yu-Gi-Oh! card battles.  There is little to the game other than battling your opponents.  This game is a sequel to Yu-Gi-Oh! Worldwide Edition: Stairway to the Destined Duel and offers more than 1000 cards to use as well as new opponents.  The game takes out some of the non-card battling features from the Worldwide Edition and leaves you with the battling as the main feature of the game.

Build up to three decks with the cards you gain as you work to beat all your opponents.  With over 1000 cards, you will have a wide range of choices for your 40-card decks.

As with the Worldwide Edition, you can also trade your cards with friends through the Link Cable.</resource>

The house is full of ghosts and cursed items, and the time limit for a living person to remain safe in this dangerous haunted house is roughly 24 hours. In addition, due to the exhaustion of their physical strength, they may run out of power before the time limit is reached.

Time and space are distorted in the mansion, and it is impossible to move around as you wish, but you must somehow find a way to return alive while you still have life left in you.</resource>

The Cube is a 3D object in the center of the screen and the animal parts fall towards it. In a similar style to Tetris the player must keep the sides from building too high. It is a quickly paced, real-time game and at later stages the player struggles to juggle the cube items to keep eliminating animals on all sides. Power-ups can be used to destroy animal parts, get points, or to make life more difficult for the player's opponents, such as by speeding up the rate at which animal parts fall to their cube, or reduce how fast their cube can spin.</resource>

It was released as part of the bit Generations games, and was only released in Japan. The game can be easily compared to the game Pong, though it features many gameplay differences, graphical enhancements (despite the graphics themselves being deliberately primitive), and sounds.

In the game, you'll take control of two paddles, each moving when the other one does. The goal is to keep the ball within the playing field. Allowing it to exit will result in a gameover. In all, there are five stages, each one containing different concepts though having the basic overall objective. For example, in the Wild Go Round you'll control a ball on a moving record. Because the record is moving, it'll alter the direction of the ball at pivotal moments, which will require the player to be quick on his feet and act appropriately. In all, the game's modes include Pool Flower, Box Juggling, Power Slide, Human League, and Wild Go Round. For players who wish to play multiplayer they can link with another Game Boy Advance with just a single cartridge. In multiplayer, all of the stages excluding Box Juggling are available for play.</resource>

It was part of the second series of bit Generations video games, and is simply just a basic puzzle video game. In the game, you'll be required to place three similarly colored tiles next to each other in order to rid of them. However, unlike most games like this, you don't swap the tiles but rather start to change the color of the tile by pressing on them with the cursor.

Each step of the game the cursor will be one of the three colors that are in play. If there's a red, blue and purple tile, then clicking on a blue tile with a red cursor won't automatically turn it into that color but will rather turn it purple. By continually pressing that tile with a red cursor, however, will eventually change it into a red tile. As you progress through the game, and there will be more than just three different colors, ranking up the difficultly level.</resource>

The game was part of the initial batch of bit Generations games. The game was not released in America or Europe, but a remake of the game, titled Art Style: ROTOHEX for the Wii's WiiWare service, was released two years later in 2008. The remake was slightly different, though was instantly recognizable to fans of Dialhex.

Gameplay
In Dialhex, you turn differently colored triangles on a playing field. The goal of the game is to turn them in a way so that you create a hexagon that contains triangles of the same color. After doing so, you'll be rewarded a set amount of points and the triangles within the hexagon will disappear, with the triangles in the surrounding areas taking their place. The board itself is in the shape of a hexagon, and triangles will continually fall down from the top. Once they hit another triangle, they'll stop moving, waiting for the player to make use of them. If the player has destroyed most of the triangles on the stage, and the amount of triangles is a bare minimum, then they can press the L and R button, or the A and B button, at the same time to cause the triangles that drop to come down faster. The triangles will also start to drop faster as the player progresses through the game.

Once you start a new game, you'll be given just two colors (in the start, green and orange). After six hexagons have been created, then another color will be added to the mix, and will start to drop down from above. In all, the colors, including the ones mentioned, are green, orange, yellow, red, blue, purple, cyan, and a darker green.

After you've reached a certain point in the game's main mode, you'll be given access to the title's endless mode. In endless mode, you'll keep on going for as long as you possibly can, trying to rank up as many points as possible. The game starts similarly to the title's main mode, and new colors will start to drop just as they did in that mode too. The only difference is that it never ends until the player gets a gameover. In order to unlock the staff credits, you just need to create six cyan hexagons in the game's main mode. After doing this the credits will be available on the game's main screen.</resource>

It should be noted, however, that it is quite a challenge to listen to the noises coming from the speaker, and that it's a lot easier to hook up ear phones or hook the GBA up to a stereo. It will also be very helpful to be in a quiet space.</resource>

The game features elements such as spectacular weather effects and cut-scenes from the film which will bring alive the world of Brother Bear. With four worlds, 16 levels and unlockable bonus games, Disney's Brother Bear for the GBA is a game of epic proportions. &amp; Disney Princess follows the adventures of six classic female characters from Disney's animated films, including Snow White, Belle, Cinderella, Ariel, Jasmine, and Aurora.



 The game is structured in the same manner as the book Disney's Princess Collection: Love and Friendship Stories, where each character has a separate storyline and explores settings inspired by her respective film. Snow White, for example, must rescue her friends while journeying through the dark woods and mines on her way to confronting the Evil Witch. Aurora of Sleeping Beauty embarks on a quest to release three fairies trapped somewhere within a castle ruled by the powerful Maleficent.</resource>

Depending on the level, the player either controls clownfish Marlin or his son Nemo. Goals in the levels might include simply finding the exit, finding certain characters or items, reaching a certain point within a time limit, or simple survival, like when Marlin and his friend Dory are chased by Bruce the shark) and The Incredibles (In the game based on the movie of the same name, you take control of Mr. Incredible when he is summoned to the island of Nomanisan for a secret assignment. The GBA version is a side-scrolling 2D beat-em-up. Initially, you can only play as Mr. Incredible but the other members of the family, along with Frozone, are playable in the later levels. The main buttons are used for basic attacks, combos and jumps, and the R button triggers special abilities known as &amp;quot;incredi-moves&amp;quot;. Each member has a different special move: Mr. Incredible gets super strength, Dash runs faster, Violet has a force field and becomes invisible, and Helen can extend her arms. Using these depletes an additional meter on the screen. It is recharged by collecting icons and defeating enemies).</resource>

Chuchu Rocket!

ChuChu Rocket is an action puzzler, designed predominantly as a multi-player game. You have indirect control over mice, and must guide them to the safety of a rocket, and away from a cat. You do this by placing arrows on the ground, which they will follow. The multi-player game is a frantic all-against-all duel, in which each player's mice will only follow instructions of their own colour. You can play this mode on your own against CPU opponents, or take on a series of predefined puzzles</resource>

Sonic Battle

Sonic Battle is a fast paced pseudo-fighting game, akin to Super Smash Brothers from Nintendo. Rather than being 3D side-scrolling, this game employs a 3D isometric view- not a static, sprite-based field though, it is comprised of actual texture-mapped polygons.

Colored tiles tumble down a conveyor belt, as you wait at the bottom. Catch them and arrange them as instructed: horizontally, vertically, diagonally - (three in a row is a &amp;quot;klax&amp;quot;) - until you complete your mission and move on. As the pace quickens, you'll need fast reflexes to stay ahead of the cascading tiles and finish the many levels! 

Marble Madness - A true arcade classic! Guide your marble through various courses to the goal. Avoid the marble munchers, the evil steelie marble, the acid pools, the marble-sucking vacuum, and other hazards along the way to the finish line! Mazes, ice patches, funnels, and catapults are just the beginning! Try to keep from &amp;quot;losing your marbles&amp;quot; as you race against time and the elements in this all-time, all-ages romp.</resource>

Spider-Man - Mysterio's Menace

Set in New York, Spider-Man: Mysterio's Menace enables players to assume the role of Spider-Man as they take on super-villain Mysterio and his illusory tricks for control of Manhattan. Spider-Man must fight a slew of Mysterio's sinister conspirators and gadgetry to get to the bottom of their plot and free New York from Mysterio's mind-warping grip. 

X2 - Wolverine's Revenge

During the 1960's, a Canadian named Logan was used in a government-conducted experiment known as Weapon X. Unbreakable adamantium was ingested into his bones, in an attempt to turn him into a &amp;quot;super-soldier&amp;quot;. For the rest of his life, Logan (who adopted the nickname Wolverine) will have to fight against the beast inside him. Only after meeting Professor Xavier and his X-Men team, Wolverine is able to find a purpose in his life. However, as his memories return, he realizes that the Weapon X experiment has infected him with a deadly virus, and he has only two days to find the cure.

It first plays from an overhead view of an Amusement Park where you can enter open doors which lead to 12 different themed worlds. Each world is a 2D side-scrolling platformer, where you face different enemies and end-level bosses all in your quest to find the Gold Amulet.  Once you finish a certain number of the levels,  you'll be rewarded with one of two mini-games. One is a target range where you have to shoot a number of enemies within a certain time. The other is a strength test where Ace must swing to hit a bell at the top of a pole.</resource>

Agent Hugo escapes to a teleporter and gets beamed to the secret hideout of R.I.S.K (Risky Intelligent Spy Knights).

From the hideout, Hugo must teleport into space, the desert and Aquapolis to defeat Geekdorph's challenges and collect information about Geekdorph's secret location - so the final three stage boss-fight can take place and the citizens of Aquapolis set free.

Hugo has a companion - TEX 2000 - an intelligent hoverboard. Surf on TEX 2000. Destroy robots with his force field or shoot them with lasers, missiles and smart bombs! Accelerate TEX 2000 to extreme speeds and take risky jumps to increase your score.

The player controls Hugo standing on the hoverboard (TEX 2000) and has to help him complete three main game plays in a total of nine levels.</resource>

Every of the 13 courses also has various special challenges, e.g. collecting or smashing certain items, which need to be performed to beat it. In contrast to the open areas of the console versions this one features more linear levels and tight time limits. 

It also replaces the &amp;quot;juice meter&amp;quot; with the so-called &amp;quot;grind meter&amp;quot; which is filled up by performing stunts. Every grind decreases this meter and if it is empty no grinds can be performed at all. Of course grinds are an elemental move to beat the challenges. 
There is also a freestyle playing mode where the player can unlock new skaters.

The graphics are by featured artist Dan Paladin. Your goal, is quite simply, to get to the end of the stage, and die as little as possible. Which is made difficult due to the fact that any bullet is an instant kill.

To help you out, you can grab a range of power-ups, such as lasers, spread shots, shotguns and more, as well as hijacking vehicles and using them for protection. Grenades can be lobbed, and you can jump on enemy shoulders and choose to bite their heads off if you like, or pick them up and throw them at other enemies. You can also dive underground for a short period of time to avoid enemies - while underground, you can drag agents into the ground to kill them.</resource>

In order to do this, she must populate a kingdom she has been given before her rival and fellow Queen candidate, Rosalia, can do the same. Angelique can call upon the help of nine male guardians who help regulate various aspects of the kingdoms, as well as send them to sabotage her rival's kingdom. If the player wins the contest, Angelique becomes the new Queen. She can also choose instead to wed one of the nine guardians, any of whom can be courted, and sacrifice her throne for true love.</resource>

Players control a polar bear (both cub and adult) trying to survive in a harsh climate of snowy landscapes. There are eleven stages where the little bear explores the environment, searches for foods and collects paw prints that unlock pictures in a photo gallery and additional chapters.

Later, two other animals can be controlled as well: a walrus that is also able to explore underwater environment, the fast Arctic fox able to hunt down rabbits and an orca whale. The levels consist of free-roaming environments, on land or underwater, where the animals need to gather food to avoid having the heart icon fade away. While playing 16 different mini-games can be accessed where the player can earn bronze, silver and golds awards to unlock additional chapters.</resource>

By taking a very unique approach to its presentation of the Arthur universe and utilising the unique features of the DSâ„¢ hardware, the Nintendo DSâ„¢ version of Arthur and the Minimoys is a different kind of game to the versions for other consoles and PC. Arthur and the Minimoys for DSâ„¢ gleefully portrays the magical world of Arthur through a series of original and entertaining micro games and with an absorbing 'virtual pet simulator' where players are responsible for caring for and breeding 'Mul mull', small, fluffy, flying creatures found in abundance in the world of Arthur.</resource>

It is a collection of two games. One old, namely a port of the SNES game Asterix and Obelix. The other game is called Asterix &amp; Cleopatra, based on the comic and animated movie of the same name.

In Asterix and Cleopatra, Asterix has to help a Egyptian architect Artifis to build his pyramid for Cleopatra. You play typical platform levels where you jump around obstacles and walk towards the right of the screen. Many enemies such as fake building contractors and Roman soldiers (sent by a jealous Caesar), and pirates have to be bashed into the sky. Each level is concluded with a mini-game. The game closely follows the events of the comic.</resource>

However, because Atomic Betty is aimed at a younger audience, there are two notable differences: first, it is a lot more difficult to die, and second, the player only needs to get one character to the exit to successfully finish the level. When on Earth, the player controls one character that can finish the homework, one that can push or pull objects, and the last that can slide under narrow gaps. 

In Space, one character can repeatedly attack and use special gadgets, one can use a jetpack for a very high jump, and the last can grab items and enemies. In addition to the main levels, the game also features levels where the player must control the spaceship as it zooms through asteroid belts and high-speed space warps.</resource>

The cards are given out in increments of five. These cards have stars on them and each card number has a certain number of these stars. The aim is to put as many stars as possible, shown on the cards in your hand, to connect together to form a combo or 'link'. The higher the combo you achieve, the more points you will achieve against your opponent, thus depleting their health bar. The games are short and can last for around 5 turns, with each turn going for close to fifteen seconds.</resource>

One of their subjects, the nameless protagonist, managed to escape. He has been infused with a demonic essence that robs him from his human form, but grants him super strength and the ability to turn flesh into stone. This GBA game offers about 20 different environments. Each environment has its own experiences and interactions. The world is inhabited by some 30 monsters and many Boss Master demons.</resource>

As the name suggests, the games are mostly played on backyard lots, although some fields, like the Gater Flats swamp, probably don't exist in many kids' backyards. Players have the choice of creating custom characters for their team or recruiting kid versions of Major League Baseball stars. In addition to season mode, players can play pickup games, compete in home run derbies and fielder's challenges, and select from three different difficulty levels for each mode. Claiming victory in these categories will unlock additional MLB players and stadiums, plus the ability to upgrade current players with moves such as fireball pitches.</resource>

Rather than help, Rowina forbids the sisters from singing and dancing and squelches their individuality. The princesses discover a magical enchanted world and escape the tyranny of Rowena. But when Genevieve learns that their father's life is in danger, the sisters must unite to save the king and their kingdom.</resource>

    <resource id="e61b25ca88d152ec3faf3131e37ab10ff438e59a" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">In the GBA version of Bionicle Heroes, based on the LEGO Bionicle franchise, players take on the guise of the TOA Anika team. Set on the island of Voya Nui, they need to retrieve the Mask of Life, stolen by the Piraka race who also enslaved the Matoran, the native inhabitants, in the process. Unlike the console and the DS versions, a top-down perspective is used.

The game takes place on six zones of the island, followed by a final showdown. The player starts as a TOA of Fire, but by completing zones and killing the level boss, additional masks can be collected: Air, Stone, Ice, Earth and Water. Each TOA has a primary and secondary weapon based on the mask's elemental nature, with specific features. During the levels, there are also weapon upgrades to be found. The second weapon is limited by an energy meter which needs some time to recharge. Each zone requires a specific TOA guise, but in the Free Play mode completed levels can be revisited and players can then switch between the forms at any time to use different abilities. TOAs can strafe while fighting - there is an option to face enemies automatically or to control this manually.

TOAs are assisted by proto-spawn orbs, sidekicks that circle around the hero and fire at enemies. The orbs are chased off when they take too much damage, but they can also be upgraded based on the 6 elements and the weapons can be customized. Players can define to have the orbs fire in spread patterns or rapid bursts, lock on targets with fire, cause explosions, fire through shields or do double damage. Additional attacks are provided through elemental runes, which provide a one-time limited effect, such as freezing enemies, activating a lightning shield, smashing enemies with spikes from the ground, temporary invulnerability, full health and regeneration, and a fire blast.

By destroying objects and buildings in the environment, blue, gray or gold LEGO pieces are revealed, providing health and bonus points. The TOAs also need to use pieces to build bridges, platforms, elevators, turrets, barricades or moving platforms. At the end of each zone, the rank and score is shown. Based on the performance or specific actions, there are 12 medals to collect, of which a few can only be found in the Free Play mode.

Each zone contains secret cheat words. Upon discovering them, they are added to a cheat menu. They allow to play as a golden TOA or to obtain a new mask with a sombrero, open up a music jukebox, provide a hidden Cluck gun or grant invincibility or one-shot kills.</resource>

The game is set in the same fictional world as the original Black/Matrix game, though hundreds of years prior. Three divisions of humankind share the same world - white-winged people who are called angels, black-winged people who are called devils, and wingless people. Those who have wings have great powers and pay little mind to the wingless ones. The angels rule the world via a religious organization called the Prodevon Church, which ensures both the cooperation and ignorance of the wingless people.</resource>

    <resource id="a1df4886c1d73b0b42234547fea2b1dd3052dbf7" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Blackthorne is an action-adventure game that takes place on the planet Tuul. Tuul was a peaceful place, until the evil warrior Sarlac used the power of the Darkstone to take control.  Blackthorne's father, the good King Vlaros, sent him to Earth just as his kingdom crumbled around him.  Now, 20 years later, Blackthorne is grown and must return to Tuul to free it from the clutches of Sarlac.

This game is played from a side-view with non-scrolling backgrounds. It has strong similarities to Prince of Persia, except you battle your foes using guns and bombs instead of a sword.</resource>

However, as Animalmen now outnumber humans, an anti-human group calling themselves the Zooligans are out to destroy the humans and take the galaxy for themselves.

It's up to Blender, the leader of the Cosmo Keepers, to save the world using his own powers and the abilities of the Mini Bros. (robotic creatures that, when evolved, help you greatly in your quest). Blender can use his large ears to float around levels, whack enemies out of the way and climb up ropes or pogo-hop.

Levels vary between platform jumping, boss battles, and every world has you driving around the level (aka Mario Kart), collecting keys to prevent the world from blowing up.

Multiplayer modes include 4-player racing, the opportunity to trade Mini Bros. plus 2 other mini-games to play.</resource>

However those are only distant memories. Ryu and his best friend Bow are apprentices in the Ranger's Guild. As adventurers they take on posted jobs needed by the townspeople. However it isn't long before one job goes awry and Bow is accused of stealing a valuable item. In order to clear his friend's name and find the meaning of his dreams, Ryu will explore the world, eventually discovering the meaning of his dreams and hidden abilities inside himself.

Breath of Fire II is a role playing game. The majority of game is played from a top-down map, however battles are seen from an isometric view. Ryu will form parties from among 8 other characters, each with their own set of skills and powers that will help him discover the truth behind the mystery.</resource>

Battle your way through over 100 levels of frantic bubble mayhem. Capture your enemies in bubbles then pop them with your spiky back to clear each stage. Find your way to the bottom of the 100-level cave and save a damsel in distress. Fortunately, if you've never experienced the glee for yourself, all of those elements are back in force in Bubble Bobble Old &amp; New for Game Boy Advance. The game closely follows the original Bubble Bobble arcade classic, but splices together two gaming generations while employing the same graphics and gameplay structure as the original. It also took inspiration from the sequel, Rainbow Islands released in 1989.</resource>

    <resource id="1f421eadeda5f0b279cfb21d115ba5eff993caea" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">CT Special Forces is a side scrolling platform shooter that has a superficial similarity to the games of the Metal Slug series. The player controls an operative of a counter-terrorist force on a mission around the globe to stop terrorist activity and arrest its leaders. The digital pad moves the character, while the B button shoots the weapon and the A button makes the character jump. The character can't shoot downwards. The L trigger cycles through the inventory (displayed on the top-left corner of the screen) and the R trigger throws grenades (when they are available). By selecting an ammunition type, the character uses the corresponding weapon (gas canisters for the flamethrower, machine gun rounds for that weapon, etc). The default rifle has an infinite number of bullets. Other items include a grappling rope and a pair of handcuffs to arrest surrendered  enemies. Ammunition and health packs are scattered throughout the levels, as are proximity mines and assorted enemies.

The regular gameplay is occasionally broken up by mini-games and entirely different sections: when the character collides with a reticule placard, the game switches to a first-person shooting gallery where the player has to shoot down a certain number of terrorists and rescue the hostages. When colliding with a parachute, two gauges with a red line on the middle appear on the screen. The one on the left measures the position of the falling character and the one on the right measures height. The character must be guided to the right spot, and the shooting button must be pressed when both gauges reach the red bar. Some mission stages change the game to a vertical shooter that recalls Tiger-Heli and similar games, where the player controls a helicopter viewed from the top.

The game has 4 missions, each with its own theme: snow mountain, desert, jungle and a city. A password system is provided (the password is displayed after the completion of every mission).</resource>

A special military unit called the Special Intervention Forces has but a single mission- to do away with all terrorist organizations and other menacing threats. The latest threat has to do with the fact that the enemy has in their possession a biochemical weapon that alters human DNA. They have used this chemical to strengthen hostility and athletic genes to produce an original species of insurgent. The Counter Terrorist Special Intervention Forces are the only ones who possess the strength and skill to crush this new adversary. Each player is responsible for controlling his or her member of the CT Special Forces, as each mission becomes increasingly difficult. In the latest threat of terrorism, the need for underwater soldiers has become a necessity. With scuba diving skills, the player can explore several underwater regions. Combat takes place in both the water and on land, so the game presents the player with a number of vehicle and weaponry options. Each skill is the most sophisticated available and designed to seek out and destroy the enemy. The game takes the player through 20 levels that test, challenge and drive the Special Forces towards victory. Fans of combat action games with a patriotic tone must try this intense game.</resource>

Incorporating more action/adventure elements into the game, 2005 ADVENTURE sends players into the wild after big game like bears and includes new features like the PDA map and vehicles. Players start out the game by creating their character from a number of options, including age, hair color, and clothing. They also get a number of points to distribute across categories like aiming, accuracy, strength, and stealth. While there are several different options like free hunt, the main feature of 2005 ADVENTURE is the career hunt mode. The storyline of 2005 ADVENTURE revolves around completing Grandpa Pete's quest to enter the hunter's hall of fame. To enter the hall of fame, a hunter has to hunt and kill an animal in each of the 65 different regions of the country. Grandpa Pete had all but three kills before he broke his leg; now, players must make the 65 kills to win the honor in Pete's name. The game includes several new items such as the PDA map. In addition to the main quest, players can also take on side missions from other hunters as they travel across Canada, Colorado, and New Mexico. Fans of the previous BIG GAME HUNTER games will find CABELA'S BIG GAME HUNTER: 2005 ADVENTURE kicks up the intensity without taking away anything that made the game a hit.</resource>

The player has at his disposal all the key abilities of the cat-lady as seen in the movie, and must traverse levels full of platforms and &amp;quot;bad guys&amp;quot;, and climbing walls, occasionally.

The game opens with a tutorial mission and then switches to a series of images resembling comic-strips that explain how Patience Phillips became Catwoman. The player then goes through the 24 levels of the game mostly jumping, climbing and sometimes fighting.

The look of the graphics aims toward a comic-book feel instead of the more realistic looking 3D of the console and PC versions.</resource>

The player, controlling Chicken Bill, shoots all the chickens that appear on the 2D hand-drawn screens, shown from a first-person perspective. There are 3 game modes:

1. Arcade: shoot a specific number of chickens to move on to the next level. There is no time limit and the enemies attack by throwing eggs towards the screen. There is no time limit and when Chicken Bill's 100 points are depleted, the game is over.

2. Classic: the same gameplay as Arcade, requiring a certain number of chickens to be shot, but now with a time limit added. Certain chickens carry time packages, providing time bonuses.

3. Multiplayer: score more points than your opponent in a set amount of time.

There are three difficulty levels and support for high scores (not saved after powering off). At the end of each level, statistics are shown based on the shots fired, hits, accuracy, general score, and energy or time remaining. There are different types of weapons (pistol, shotgun, uzi, machine gun, laster, flame thrower and bombs) and a limited amount of ammo. During gameplay, accuracy is shown through a thermometer on the screen. When it rises to the top, all hits are awarded with double points.</resource>

Rumors circulated that escaping to the surface would allow the robot to become human. Getting out would be the trick. Each room is inhabited by monsters that must be neutralized and the exit itself hidden underneath bricks.

The first of the Bomberman series. Bomberman is a single player game with a top down view and simplistic controls. In fact, in addition to movement, you only have a single ability: placing bombs. Each bomb explodes into a cross-shaped blast (4 directions) which can destroy either enemies or blocks. Power-ups may be found to increase the size of the blast, place additional bombs, increase the speed of the Bomberman or to walk through walls. Your goal on each level is to destroy all enemies and escape through the exit before the time limit is up.. Hitting the exit with a bomb blast releases more enemies which must also be destroyed.</resource>

Fortunately, Crash is ready for him and has learned new combat and acrobatic abilities to hijack these large outrageous mutants and use their powers against each other and eventually defeat Neo Cortex's new Doominator Robot.

Crash of the Titans for GBA is an action-sidescroller game. Crash jumps, punches, and smashes his way through six island locations in search of Wumpa Fruit, Tiki Masks, and other collectibles. Along the way, he'll encounter Cortex's titular henchmen, which he'll have to climb on top and hijack to take their combat powers. By jacking the right combination of foes, he'll eventually gain the powers he needs to take on Neo Cortex himself and save Wumpa Island yet again.</resource>

In this way you can raise evermore intelligent (or stupid), friendly (aggressive), curious (indifferent), etc, Norns depending on your personal preferences. You will notice that in fact you can't protect them from all harm that's awaiting them. But the more you succeed, the more you will be proud of each Norn which you accompany to its old age.

Make monkey business as you help George and his friends discover the one item special enough to save the museum from the bulldozer. Loads of bonus content and challenging mini-games keep players busy long after the main story is done.</resource>

It was a Roleplaying game set in the Zoids series, and was sold as a special edition package bundled with a Diablo Tiger Beta toy. Both versions include an infrared adapter. This adapter, along with the game, made it possible to control the Cyber Drive Zoids wirelessly via the GBA. The GBA's R and L buttons are used for shifting, while the D-Pad moves the Zoid forwards and backwards. A fires the weapons, and B controls leaping. When controlling the Zoid, the GBA screen shots a special cockpit with information and read-outs. The RPG takes elements from both Zoids Saga and Zoids Assault game types, but features polygonal representations of Zoids as well as hand-drawn story segments.</resource>

It places you in the cockpit of the Silverhawk once again in order to defeat the forces of intergalactic fish threatening the galaxy in standard side-scrolling space shooter fare. 

Standout features include the use of the classic Darius level selection scheme that allows the game to branch in different stages and thus offer a series of different endings depending on what road you take. Unique for this GBA remake is the ability to play each stage individually (once you unlock it in the main campaign) in a level-select mode.</resource>

The cartridge includes several variants of the game. The main mode is called &amp;quot;XGP&amp;quot;. Its basics are the same as in the original: The player's spaceship flies left or right over a scrolling landscape that wraps around after a few screens. The goal is destroy all invading aliens before they can capture the humans sitting on the ground. Besides updated graphics with various backgrounds and sprites for the enemies and humans, there are other differences as well: players can select from different ships, all with slightly different weapons and ratings for shields and speed. The XGP mode offers six different levels to complete. It can also be played by two players over the System Link.

The cartridge also includes &amp;quot;Classic&amp;quot; mode, which is a port of the original arcade game. Finally, &amp;quot;XG&amp;quot; mode is the same gameplay-wise as Classic, but has been updated with graphics similar to the XGP mode.</resource>

The third Digimon game for the Game Boy Advance, Digimon Racing has all the features you'd expect out of a racing game. There's a good variety of colorful and light-hearted tracks (15 in all, including a wide variety of themes such as jungles, deserts, busy city streets, ice tracks, and gravel-covered hills), nearly a dozen Digimon to pick from and unlock, and several gameplay modes ranging from cup races to time trials. A handful of boss races round out the action, and provide a challenge for players.

The twist to this game comes as the racers collect energy on the track to digivolve into upgraded versions of themselves. Once you've digivolved, you can use additional offensive powers to further hamper your opponents and keep your own Digimon ahead of the others.

While the single-player game will keep you busy for a while with its many modes and characters, Digimon Racing really shines in the multiplayer arena. Since it includes support for up to four players using the link cable or wireless adapter, the multiplayer experience is the real highlight of the game.</resource>

In the interactive game, an animated Lizzie takes on a side-scrolling action-adventure filled with 12 captivating levels. Players travel to Lizzie's favorite places to hang, such as the beach and shopping mall -- but along the way must be sure to look out for cheerleaders and other rivals who are plotting to ruin the day.

In the live action television episode, &amp;quot;You're a Good Man, Lizzie McGuire,&amp;quot; featured on the game cartridge, the upcoming school dance has been cancelled due to someone defacing the school principal's statue, and won't be re-scheduled until the culprit confesses. Unfortunately for Lizzie, she saw the offender - and it's Kate. To make matters worse, Kate knows Lizzie knows, and now Lizzie is faced with the dilemma of either turning in Kate or sitting quietly and allowing the school dance to be cancelled. Meanwhile, Matt and Lanny pool their funds to buy a cool new bike, but then discover that sharing a bike is harder than it looks.</resource>

In order for the park to be opened, it's up to Mickey, Minnie, Donald and Daisy to find the magical powers and return the park back to the way it was.

In order to do this, the gang must complete various party games while travelling along the game board. Players take turns to role the dice and move their character. Certain parts of the board will open up mini-games, which must be completed to move on, and the winner is the one with the most magical power stars, which are gained by landing on blue spaces on the board.

There are four boards, each with their own theme based on an amusement park ride. Up to four players can play using the one console, or play with four consoles to challenge each other in a set of mini-games.</resource>

    <resource id="6bec220e60b96f7ae47a629d0f3d0506f00e2dea" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">In this sequel to the original Doom, you play the same hero - the last remaining space marine. After having single-handedly saved Mars from demonic threat, you return to Earth, only to find out that the demons have already invaded it, killed all its inhabitants or turned them into demons. It's your task to kill all the demons and to save the Earth.

Doom II looks and plays very similarly to its predecessor, utilizing the same 3D graphical engine with 2D sprites for enemies. The gameplay once again consists entirely of navigating the hero from first-person view through 3D environments and shooting at the demons while attempting to find your way out by flipping switches and looking for keys. Unlike in Doom, which is divided into three episodes, the 30 levels of Doom II (plus the 2 secret levels) form one long episode. 

You have the same weapons as in the first Doom, plus a new one: a super shotgun. There are also some new demons in this sequel, such as the chaingun-toting Heavy Weapon Dudes, the skeletal Revenants who launch homing missiles and the Arch-Viles who have a highly damaging fire attack. There is also one new power-up, a Megasphere which boosts your health and armor to the max.</resource>

The races instead take place in and around major cities. The cars use all the technology available today, to increase speed and `downforce?. With less stringent rules, teams have worked in different directions creating a wide variety of enhanced super cars.</resource>

Sudoku is a logic-puzzle game in which a 27x27 square is partially filled in with numbers and the object of the game is to fill in the blank squares so that every column, row and 3x3 square will have a number of 1-9 entered...without repeating.

Dr. Sudoku features 1,000 puzzles crafted by the leading developer of Sudoku, Skynet Corporation of Japan.  If you are new to the game, have no fear - in addition to readily available hints, Dr. Sudoku has a tutorial mode that will guide you through the game. You can also ask the doctor to verify if a puzzle is actually solvable.

Another feature is &amp;quot;Original Mode&amp;quot; that allows you to create your own puzzles (this allows you to transfer puzzles you see in the newspaper onto your GBA).</resource>

The player can choose from Droopy, Dripple, Butch, Bubbles, Vavoom, MC Wolf, and Screwy Squirrel. Each game can be played on a background that ranges like a jail, outside of an Old West saloon, and the North Pole with varying terrain like grass, clay, and ice. Games can be played in a two-player mode over a single cart and even up to four players with the support of a Game Boy Advance link cable. It will even support the Game Boy Advance's downloadable link for players without requiring a copy of the game. One of the best ways to play this game is in the arcade mode. This mode lets players use special impressive attacks when they build up their powers. The character called 'Vavoom' can set in motion a flirty ball that will dodge and sidestep swings. Droopy can blast off three balls of terror at once for players to panic over and attempt to retrieve them. In general, Butch has the most strength while Screwy possesses extraordinary athletic abilities. This arcade style game is a fun way to participate in an entertaining game with classic characters many already know and love. DROOPY'S TENNIS OPEN is sure to draw new fans of the classic cartoon characters as they are just as endearing and entertaining as they have always been in their cartoon shorts.</resource>

    <resource id="6bd6fbe1b73414c44b0f0e2cd12f26379b5828ba" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Dynasty Warriors Advance is a Game Boy Advance adaptation of the Dynasty Warriors franchise. Based on the &amp;quot;Three Kingdoms period&amp;quot; of ancient China,  it takes place at the end of the Han Dynasty during 190 A.D. As the previous government collapses, warlords rise up and fight among one another, eventually establishing three powerful kingdoms: Wei, Wu and Shu. Generals from each of these nations spend the next 100 years fighting among one another, each trying to become the dominant power.

Dynasty Warriors Advance is a top-down turn-based strategy board game, but with a focus on action combat. Since it is based on the earlier Dynasty Warriors titles, many of the same concepts carry over. Players begin by choosing one of three available characters from the lands of either Wu, Shu or Wei. Each character has their own unique storyline and missions. A briefing is given for each mission detailing specific objectives before allowing the player to equip themselves with weapons and skills at the camp. Once begun, the player moves the designed number of spaces (determined by movement) around the &amp;quot;board&amp;quot;. If an enemy player is encountered, the game shifts to a top-down action fighting mode. Here the player uses one button to attack, another button to charge and another to unleash a misou special attack once it is powered up. Misou energy is charged by successful attacking enemy units. The player's success against the enemy unit will determine the unit's &amp;quot;heath&amp;quot; and will be destroyed completely if all of it's units are destroyed. Some enemy units contain not just soldiers but enemy generals who have their own special moves and greater health. Many missions feature specific objectives rather than just defeating all enemies.</resource>

Events require pressing buttons quickly for speed, pressing buttons in the right order at the right time to do tricks, and turning.  The Figure Skating event is very much like the Dance Dance series of games.</resource>

Jim is suddenly struck by a very large ultra- high- tech- indestructible- super- space- cyber- suit. Through sheer luck, Jim rests safely in the neck ring of the suit. 

Suddenly, the ultra-high-tech space particles of the suit begin interacting with Jim's soft wormy flesh. A radical light-speed evolution takes place.

Jim soon realizes he is in control of the suit.

Gameplay is similar to the first game, with Jim jumping and running through the levels. There are 5 weapons more than the original game to collect. Characters like Princess Whats-Her-Name and Psy-Crow appear.</resource>

The game tells the story of Ecks, an ex-FBI Agent whose orders are to hunt down the beautiful assassin named Sever. As the cat-and-mouse-hunt progresses, both agents will find out that they are mere pawns in a larger government conspiracy...

In the Single Player mode, the player can choose wether he wants to play as Ecks or Sever. The choice makes a radical difference in the single-player campaign. As Ecks, your orders are to chase Sever, whilst as Sever, you have to evade him. The levels for both characters tend to be the same, but with different objectives, and different locations for both characters. 

As an example, the orders of Sever are to hunt down and kill a government agent whilst as Ecks, your orders are to prevent the assassination. During this level, both characters will encounter each other. As Ecks, you'll have to try and snipe Sever whilst evading her grenades. When you play this level as Sever, you'll have to throw grenades at Ecks, whilst avoiding his sniper fire.

The game also has a multi-player mode for up to 4 players with three different modes, which are Deathmatch (Every man for himself), Assassination (one player is the assassin who has to hunt down the VIP who's being protected by bodyguards) and Bomb kit (Try to gather all parts of a bomb before the other players do).</resource>

Centering around three kids with the same name, MIS-EDVENTURES follows Ed, Edd, and Eddy through yet another of their zany adventures. Gamers will control all three kids throughout the game, switching between them at any point. Each of the three had their own special abilities, and players will need to master each character to get through the puzzle-filled levels. Ed is the powerhouse of the team, able to pick up large objects and move them out of the way. Edd can operate machinery and can make use of different items. Eddy has stealth abilities and is the only character who can use stink bombs to get enemies out of the way. Each of the three also has an unique team-up move that involved all three characters working together. The levels contain the typical insanity often found in the cartoon. On one level, for example, players have to try to sell a number of snow cones from their snow cone stand; however, to get the business going, players have to steal ice from other characters. There are several different scams to complete, each of which involves Ed, Edd, and Eddy making use of whatever they can find or steal. Gamers who love ED, EDD, N EDDY will love stepping into the characters' shoes with ED EDD N EDDY: MIS-EDVENTURES.</resource>

Sure, he was raised by elves after stowing away in Santa's bag, but after 30 years, he just doesn't seem to fit in any more â€“ literally. Santa suggests that Buddy journey to New York and find his real father, but when he arrives, hilarity ensues as Buddy learns his way in the Big City. Make your way through 10 different stages inspired by the movie or compete in three different mini-games.

Can you take on the role of Buddy the elf and bring Christmas cheer to everyone? A six-foot, five-inch elf doesn't exactly blend in. You'll have to brave icebergs, Manhattan traffic and worse. It's up to you to help Santa and save Christmas!</resource>

Players use combinations of spells, melee attacks, and ranged attacks to battle Urgals, thieves, soldiers, and other various enemies.  This is an RPG where combat strategy plays a key role in success.

Players can make use of the RPG mechanics to create offensive and defensive potions, craft better armor and weapons, learn offensive and defensive spells, or become trackers who are able to find hidden encounters.  This design encourages experimentation, opens up a lot of strategic possibilities, and allows a lot of replayability.

The player assumes the role of Eragon, a young boy with a mysterious origin and an important future, on his perilous journey to avenge his father, rescue the woman of his dreams and join forces with the Varden in their war against King Galbatorix. On this adventure Eragon encounters many allies; Brom the old wizened story teller, Ayra the elf guard of the dragon egg, Murtagh the orphan with a troubled past, Angela an herbalist witch, and a powerful dragon that will help unveil Eragon's true destiny.</resource>

Featuring nearly ever soccer team in existence and hundred of players, plus tweaks in game play and several new additions. Gamers will first notice the slight changes in controlling their teams. The passing and dribbling controls have been fine-tuned, allowing gamers to control nearly every aspect of the game. Each player has a strength rating that comes into effect when passing, as does the amount of weight players put behind the kick. A new shooting method, called the Optimized Shot Meter, requires more control and attention, as well. All of these realistic details make gamers feel like they're actually in the game and in control of everything. Manager mode now requires players to keep their club's budgets and handle purchases. Players have to decide how much to spend on staff, recruiting, stadium expenses, and other items. Then gamers have to decide if they want to sign with a sponsor to bring in extra income. All of this adds up to create a game that requires managers to really manage their team. FIFA SOCCER 06 contains all of the modes that made the previous FIFA SOCCER games great, including season, tournament, shoot-out, and verses modes. Soccer fans will enjoy playing against all of today's best soccer clubs throughout the season as they recruit, train, and guide their team to victory in FIFA SOCCER 06.</resource>

FIFA 2003 is the tenth game in the FIFA series and the seventh to be produced in 3D. A number of new features were added to improve upon the previous version. Club Championship Mode was introduced with the feature of playing against 17 of Europe's top clubs in their own stadiums and the fans singing their unique chants and songs. A TV-style broadcast package gives highlights at half-time and full-time, as well as comprehensive analysis. One of the most anticipated new features was EA Sport's &amp;quot;Freestyle Control&amp;quot; which allows the user to flick the ball on and lay it off to team mates. Other additions include greater likenesses of some of the more well-known players such as Thierry Henry and Ronaldinho, as well as realistic player responses.

The European cover features Roberto Carlos, Ryan Giggs, and Edgar Davids, representing Brazil, Manchester United and Juventus respectively. In the United States, Landon Donovan appeared in Roberto Carlos' place.</resource>

Stopping you from doing this are two monsters, called Pooka and Fygar, who will continually chase you around. The only weapon that you carry is an air pump, which you can use to inflate the monsters to the point where they explode. (if you start to inflate them but stop doing so, the monsters will get turned back to their normal selves). Furthermore, rocks are scattered throughout the earth, and you can use these rocks to squash them. If the monsters do not find you for several seconds, they will eventually get turned into ghosts, which are able to walk through the earth. They are invincible and cannot be killed. From time to time, vegetables will appear in the center, and you can get these for points.</resource>

Not to be confused with the western Super Mario Bros. 2, this sequel to Super Mario Bros. is very much an expansion to the original, with many reused graphics and concepts, though new ones are also present.

Instead of offering a two-player mode as in the original, this game allows you to choose between a Mario mode and a Luigi mode, with each character handling differently. Mario has tighter ground control, while Luigi has greater jumping capabilities.

Power-ups remain the same: Super Mushrooms grow a brother from small to Super size, Fire Flowers give them the ability to throw fireballs at enemies, Starman makes a character temporarily invincible, and a 1-Up Mushroom will give one more life. New to this game is a power-down, a Poison Mushroom which will harm you as if it were an enemy.

The goal is still to survive from the left side of the level to the right, avoiding perils and bopping enemies along the way, progressing through a series of 8 worlds with 4 levels each. That is, unless a warp zone is found allowing areas to be skipped. There are new tricks that work for and against the player, though. Some piranha plants will come out of their pipe even if you're standing right next to them, and bloobers now appear outside of the water. Wind can be present to alter how jumps will behave. Some warp zones will actually take the player to an earlier level instead of to a later one.</resource>

    <resource id="f87a0ad82ec00d5e8af59e3cce772690a775ac3b" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">This game is a licensee of the 2005 movie &amp;quot;Fantastic 4&amp;quot;. Unlike many licensed titles, this third-person action game in the vein of the Onimusha or Devil May Cry series only takes the base of its plot from the actual movie, then liberally changes it to make for better gameplay. Generally, the game brings in more content from the comic books than the movie, particularly considering the villains that appear. While the movie pretty much only concerned itself with Victor von Doom aka &amp;quot;Doctor Doom&amp;quot; as its supervillain of choice, the game brings in various characters from the comic books as well - the Mole Man, the Puppet Master, or Diablo, to name a few. The gameplay usually consists of walking the heroic title characters around a level and beating up the various enemies that cross their path. There are mission objectives, but usually the only way to achieve them leads through the enemies and just as usually the only way to fail them is to be overwhelmed by the Bad Guys. Beating up enemies yields points, which can be used to upgrade characters with new special moves or unlock various bonus materials. To spice it all up, developer Seven Studios have also thrown in a co-op mode that allows for playing the normal single-player mission in a tag team with a second player.</resource>

Fire Pro Wrestling has a stacked roster, comprised of many not-quite-copyright-infringing wrestlers like &amp;quot;The Bionic Man&amp;quot; Steve Majors (&amp;quot;Stone Cold&amp;quot; Steve Austin) and Axe Duggan (Hulk Hogan), making WCW vs. WWF vs. ECW matches possible.  The controls are much more than the typical &amp;quot;mash buttons until something happens&amp;quot; that were so popular in earlier wrestling games, instead relying on timing to properly execute a move or hold.</resource>

From the main driver profile where all statistics are recorded, players can do a quick race of one of the three competitions: Ford Competition, Ford Challenge and Ford Collection. Most of the game's features need to be unlocked first. Next to the regular racing controls there is also a button used for boost. The different competitions offer ten racing types:

1. Standard: race for the first place.

2. Elimination: race five opponents over three laps. After the first and the second lap, the last two cars are knocked out and a duel ensues in the final lap.

3. Duel: a 3-lap race against six challengers in succession. After each won lap, a new one starts.

4. Drafting: stay in the opponent's slipstream to raise a power bar.

5. Driving Skills: race against the time and keep the timer going by passing through gates that award time bonuses.

6. Seconds Out: race against the time while collecting bonuses.

7. Time Attack: a straightforward timed race.

8. Boost: race with two boosts per lap.

9. Relay: transfer a baton three times around the track.

10. Overtake: overtake a number of vehicles before time runs out.</resource>

    <resource id="7848d1bd16ed1dd197ebb4a197cee8e01526a030" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Fortress is a Tetris-variant puzzle game. As in that classic game, geometric pieces fall from the top of the screen and must be arranged in lines. Only instead of eliminating lines, the objective this time is to add them to the screen. The game starts with a timer (that counts a moment where neither player attack) and a castle gate falling between two flags (the opponent's flags can be seen to the left of the screen). Once placed, the remaining pieces are used to build a castle around it, as every 2x3 grid of pieces transforms into its walls. A grid of 8x3 pieces transforms into a wizard's tower that can summon a creature to attack the enemy castle. 

Certain special blocks add features to the building: a cannon block places a shooting cannon that starts to attack automatically the opponent's fortress. A block with a window adds one to the building. Repairing peons come out of it to help fix the damage to the castle's walls. A block with a bomb adds a cannon that fires a peon towards the opponent's castle (an aiming reticule is shown over the enemy castle to help choose the right spot). Building walls around these special blocks prevent their destruction from the enemy attack. A monster appears randomly at the bottom of the screen to attack both players.

The player's goal at each level is to reach a number of score points before the opponent. The pieces can be maneuvered with the digital pad, and pressing UP on it makes them fall fast downwards. They can be rotated clockwise and anti-clockwise with the A and B buttons, respectively. Holding the R trigger allows the player to move the screen with the digital pad (for a full view of battle scene). When pressed, the L trigger destroys the top 3 rows of your castle and decreases the score.

The game has three game modes: tournament, battle and blitz. They vary in the amount of seconds on the timer and the goal score. There are four themes: pre-historic, medieval, pirate and space.</resource>

As the player, you are given the responsibility of creating Dinos and building places for them to live in the city. You can also use your Dinos to battle against other humans' Dinos through a system known as Dino Net. Battles take place on a virtual grid where both teams cannot see the other until they choose to attack. The battle system is quite different from other RPGs in this sense, with strategic elements resembling Battleship and Minesweeper. For battling, Dinos are capable of equipping specialized weapons and armor known as Devices. Devices boost a Dino's stats in battle and also give them a special attack, effectively allowing the player to customize the Dino's strengths and moveset.</resource>

Both were released in the fall of 2001 in Japan, neither have been translated into other languages.

Unlike other areas of the Suikoden franchise, in which the storyline is a major element of gameplay, Card Stories focuses mainly on the card battles themselves and less on the plot.

Most of the cards feature characters who appear in both Suikoden and Suikoden II of Konami's role-playing video game series. Several cards also feature characters who would later go on to appear in Suikoden III.

The GBA game retells the story of Suikoden II with a few changes to how they transpire.</resource>

Ghost Rider, although going against Mephisto's will, agrees to stop this plan only to save the woman he loves, Roxanne Simpson. 

The player as The Ghost Rider must stop this plan by battling many demons on Earth while on foot with upgradeable attacks done with fists and the Hell chain. The player must also race across miles of land on the Hell Cycle killing the demons on their various transportation ways with the hell chain and fireballs.</resource>

The second game in the series includes a number of paintball pros, different modes, and a level editor. Like the previous game, GREG HASTING'S TOURNAMENT PAINTBALL MAX'D includes a number of different gameplay modes. Players work as part of a team (either AI-controlled or with friends) to take down the opposing team in a number of different environments. The single-player campaign mode takes it a step further, putting players in charge of forming a paintball team from a number of unknowns and turning them into paintball champions. Along the way, players will face off against big-name paintball players, including Nicky Cuba, Matt Marshall, Peter Utsching, and, eventually, Greg Hasting himself. Between tournaments, players can purchase new equipment for their characters and spend accumulated skill points to increase their statistics. The biggest addition to MAX'D is the level editor. This allows gamers to create their own paintball arenas ranging from small to large, cluttered to open. Players can add bunkers, rocks, trees, picnic tables, and many other items to the field. Each map can be shared online or played with computer-controlled opponents. The ability to create and share custom levels online will keep players coming back to GREG HASTING'S TOURNAMENT PAINTBALL MAX'D for some time. It provides gamers with everything that makes paintball great without worrying about getting a ball of paint all over their faces.</resource>

    <resource id="1068ba8b0b4e3ed34dec83236c3b93aaaf5546da" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">The game for Game Boy Advance based on the second Harry Potter book and movie is, like its predecessor, an action adventure, this time with an isometric perspective.

In Harry's second year at Hogwarts, bad things are happening. The ancient Chamber of Secrets has been opened, and what lurks within is attacking students. To get through this ordeal alive (and advance the plot) Harry must again complete various challenges. These mostly consist of navigating large mazes - fighting monsters, solving puzzles, flipping switches and pressing buttons for doors to open. Six spells are available to help. As Harry is often in places he shouldn't be, stealth sequences are also a large part of the game. To avoid teachers and prefects, he can sneak around slowly and hide behind curtains. If he is caught, he is thrown out (to try again) and house points can be deducted.

As in other Potter games, there are a lot of collectibles, found both in plain view and in hidden areas. Sets of Famous Wizard cards unlock bonuses, Every Flavour Beans get Harry passwords that let him move through shortcuts in the school and Chocolate Frogs increase his maximum stamina.

Finally, Quidditch is also back in this game, this time in three-dimensional space, viewed from the back.</resource>

The Minister for Magic has decided to teach courses in defensive magic, but this leaves the young wizards woefully unprepared to defend themselves against the dark forces threatening them. Meeting secretly with a small group of students who name themselves &amp;quot;Dumbledore's Army&amp;quot;, Harry has taken it upon himself to teach his band of students how to defend themselves against the Dark Arts, preparing the courageous young wizards for the extraordinary battle that lies ahead.</resource>

You control Harry from an overhead view and must complete several tasks. These range from mundane class assignments like collecting ingredients for a potion to facing off against a giant troll. To master these challenges, Harry can learn five spells that allow him to push back opponents, flip switches, open doors, levitate objects and more. If Harry is hurt, he can find and eat Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans to regain health. By performing admirably in learning spells and completing missions, Harry can gain extra House Points so that Gryffindor might win the House Cup. If he misbehaves by attacking other students, or being caught wandering the halls at night, points will be deducted, however.
As seeker for the Gryffindor team, Harry must also compete in Quidditch matches. The game has a special mode for Quidditch and other events where Harry might have to mount his broom.</resource>

It's similar in nature to the Picross series of games - single screen grid puzzles where you're given clues on where to chip away, eventually revealing a picture in the grid. Elements of Minesweeper are also present - each square you reveal will let you know how many of the same color square are touching it.

Hatena Satena features cute, interesting character designs by Super Lovers.

While the game is solely in Japanese and does feature quite a bit of text, it's completely playable by anyone regardless of language skill.</resource>

 You can:
Lengthen or Shorten a season
Create new teams
Re-arrange the divisons
move players from different teams before the game starts
Change team settings
Create custom made players
...and generally do just about anything you want

As the bus rolls down the streets, players will release waves of spuds down the street ahead of them, and if a potato runs into a potato of the same color, they will save that potato. There's constant screen action as each spud is animated, and waves its arms to attract your attention. The little spuds are cute, displaying a wide range of comical anims and they're literally everywhere. It's up to players to capture the spuds and save the Earth for good!</resource>

The player explores a LEGO-based environment in an open world format: ride a skateboard, drive, fly and pilot a range of vehicles all whilst performing stunts and tricks while taking on the bad guy, Brickster. The player is cast as Pepper Roni, a lead stuntman in a big movie production set on LEGO Island.

Even though the player is free to go wherever he wants, there is a story behind the game divided over 25 missions. All the missions are stunt-based. Running around the world in 3rd-person view, the controls are pretty basic and do not offer the trick combinations of other stunt/trick-based games. It is easy to pick up and play, even for the younger players, without worrying too much about what button combination will do what trick. Instead the player can focus on the missions by only having to complete basic tricks with a few button presses.</resource>

The Ancients disappeared, leaving only their devices for future civilizations to discover.  Years later, the &amp;quot;Settlers&amp;quot; arrived and built their cities in the lands where the machinery was left, and all was prosperous.

However, nothing remains perfect forever.  Powerful alchemists tried to harness the power of the Ancients' machines in their lust for power, and war broke out.  Those that tried to use the Ancients' machines, or The Dark Alchemists, as they became known, were killed or exiled, and peace eventually returned.  Rumour has it though, that the last of the Dark Alchemists, the Monophonic Menace, has returned to conquer the world.

Juka and the Monophonic Menace is an action-adventure game.  The title character, Juka, is an alchemist who can collect ingredients from trees, water, bushes, and other places to mix and create potions.  Potions can be used as a form of defense against enemies, can alter the landscape, or even activate machines.  Juka also has a &amp;quot;Sound Staff&amp;quot;, which can be used to absorb and fire back different types of sounds at certain enemies.</resource>

Think you can do any better? Try your hand at plotting out all of the details of the creation and management of a dinosaur park in JURASSIC PARK III: Park Builder. A strategy-simulation title of the highest caliber, the game leaves you in charge of 100 dinosaur species you have the task of placing them and maintaining their health. Of course, there's also the matter of the restaurants, shops, rides, and other attractions. If the park you create is too boring, poorly maintained, or excessively expensive, no one will show up, so you'd better use some seriously discerning judgment. In addition to managing the park, you'll have to pick up DNA strands from throughout the park to create new dinosaurs to keep the people coming back. Does it sound like too much to handle? Just wait until one of your prehistoric pals escapes on opening day.</resource>

K-1 Pocket Grand Prix 2 is a Japan only sequel in which you can select from a roster of 17 famous K-1 fighters from different regions and compete to win the grand prix tournament.
You can also create a fighter and select a region and selection of punches and kicks for him.
The game represents the fighters as over top cartoony sprites in the same style as puzzle fighter does for street fighter characters.
The game plays out in sped up 3 minute rounds and does not represent accurate K-1 fighting as fighters can utilize special moves such as flaming kicks.
The game borrows features from other 2D fighters such as street fighter allowing you to do charge attacks, parries, super moves and you win the game by depleting your opponents health bar.
The game is a little tongue in cheek, when cro-cop wins a fight he does his winning pose in his famous cop uniform.</resource>

    <resource id="204740957cbabe50f10f2e1fe3ebcc82cbc987e4" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Tōru and his girlfriend Mari are on vacation at a skiing lodge when they find themselves suddenly drawn into a horrible murder mystery. The player must solve the crime. If they are too slow in collecting clues, additional murders will be committed, and will eventually result in a horror movie-like ending. The goal is to complete the story and get a certain number of endings. When this happens, two more stories are unlocked. Getting every possible ending of all three stories will unlock two more stories, these being self-parodies. Completing these unlocks one final feature, a parody of Torneko no Daibōken: Fushigi no Dungeon. None of the stories are related to each other in any way, but they all feature the same characters.

The gameplay mostly consists of still pictures with text covering the whole screen, which must be read. The player must make choices, including the choice of pointing out who the murderer is.</resource>

Unlike the Windows and Dreamcast versions of this game, the GBA version is a 2D side scrolling platform game. You control Kao the Kangaroo through twenty-seven levels. You basic modes of travel are running or jumping but in later levels, you will have snowboarding, flying and jet skiing. As you travel along, enemies try to stop you. You must kill or avoid these enemies. Your main weapon is a pair of boxing gloves with which you can pound enemies but, if you push down and attack, you can also do a tail spin to attack lower-height enemies. In each level, there are flags you can pick up and, by pressing select, you can drop them to create your own continue point.</resource>

    <resource id="d7b68264bfbb38ed6fb6e1ee2fcfb804aaf74086" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Karnaaj Rally is a handheld racing game which is played from a top down perspective and mixes 2D and 3D graphics. It's an arcade racer similar to Micro Machines where the player competes against three other racers on a number of different tracks. To his help, the player has a temporary turbo which he can refill by driving over special items that he finds on the race tracks. Weapons exist too; rockets and mines can be used by the player to stop the competition from winning. 

The game's career mode allows the player to compete and  progress in four different race series. Each of these has unique vehicles and courses. While racing the player can earn money which can be used to upgrade the car's tires and engine as well as buy more armor, rockets and mines. There's also a gambling option. The player can bet by guessing on different outcomes from the races, such as the right finishing order. 

The game also has a multiplayer mode for up to four players.</resource>

In Europe, it is known as King Kong: The Official Game of the Movie. Due to the limited technology the Game Boy Advance has, King Kong: The 8th Wonder of the World is very different from the home console versions of the game. In this game, players switch between various roles - one being the movie exhibition visiting Skull Island to do filming which comprises actress Ann Darrow, director Carl Denham and scriptwriter Jack Driscoll, and the 25 ft gorilla and king of Skull Island, King Kong. While the overhead human section focuses on puzzle-solving and adventuring elements, Kong sections are combat-oriented side-scrollers.</resource>

It is the first game in the Klonoa series to combine both standard action-gaming elements with role-playing features.
Taking a unique twist on the normal gameplay of the Klonoa handheld games, Klonoa Heroes instead relies on the player moving Klonoa, Guntz, or Pango across the screen from a top-down perspective, having them defeat enemies and earn experience points in the form of Dream Shards (small, crystal-like objects) and gold, which is used for currency, along the way. Klonoa once again utilizes his familiar weapon, the Wind Ring, but this time the &amp;quot;wind bullet&amp;quot; he can fire from it can be either blue or red. Guntz's handguns and Pango's bombs work the same way. Characters can acquire different weapons throughout the game. Likewise, each enemy in the game is given a color affinity of either blue or red, and Klonoa (or the other characters) can deal more damage to them by attacking with the same color.</resource>

Yūjō no Zakeru Dream Tag Tournament (translated Golden Gash Bell!! Wish! Electric Shock of Friendship Dream Tag Tournament) is a 2D fighting game and a sequel to Konjiki no Gashbell: Unare Yuujou no Zakeru 2. It was released on the Game Boy Advance on November 24, 2005 in Japan only. This installment quite changes the style of play with respect to its predecessors who used a pair of humans and suckers fighting together. Instead, he uses a more traditional one-on-one system, where mamodos fight alone and their human companions can be briefly invoked to assist in a special attack. The biggest novelty of the game is that the player chooses two different mamodos to form a dream team and fight against two enemy mamodos. However, they do not fight together and cannot be exchanged during the fight and can only be exchanged at the end of the round. Even so, inactive mamodos can be invoked just like human partners for fleeting assistance. The game features - 18 Playable Characters - Thunder Class Tournament (This Game's Story Mode) - Dream Match Tournament (This Game's Arcade Mode) - Free Battle - 2 Player Versus - Training Mode - 4 Mini-Games - Collectables</resource>

Also unlike Scrabble, the tile can be placed anywhere on the board, next to tiles from multiple words, even if it is placed next to a tile that, when combined with it, would make a nonexistant word. As long as the placing of the tile forms at least one word, it is allowed.</resource>

    <resource id="c5b68eefe43e95348fa8ffdea35819dabe5e0668" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Kururin Paradise is the sequel to the GBA launch title, Kuru Kuru Kururin. In this game, Kururin and his family see an advertisement for the circus, which takes place at 6:00. Kururin's family arrive there on time, but Kururin is late, and when he gets there, everybody is missing! It's up to Kururin to search across the land for his missing family using his faithful helicopter, the Heririn. As in the first game, Kururin must navigate his way through fairly narrow mazes, trying not to hit the walls. Three consecutive hits, and the Heririn is destroyed, and you must start the stage again.

Paradise is vastly improved from the original game. It is now possible to find hidden keys in the levels, which open up locked doors, allowing for branched paths in the world map. Certain paths also lead to boss encounters, which take the form of an addictive mini-game including, but not limited to, lawn mowing, gathering stars, flying Kururin himself through clouds, and hopping across a path dodging helicopter blades. If you beat the boss, these mini-games are then added to your mini-game library, where you can play them against up to three friends using only one cart.

The game also features twelve toys built in that can be accessed by selecting one from a menu, then turning your GBA off, then on again. Most of them are fairly useless or incomprehensible in Japanese, but there are a couple of interesting ones, like the love tester, the musical note player, and the memory match game.</resource>

Players must prove their driving skills in four different worlds to qualify for the ultimate race on planet Xalax. 

The Story Game mode is where all the real action of Lego Racers 2 takes place.  In this mode, you become a new racer, determined to become Galactic Racing Champion.  Along the way, other racers challenge you as your quest to become number 1 continues.  The more races you win, the more Golden Blocks you receive and also the more parts for your car you win.  Golden Blocks help you move throughout the different levels of the game. You start out with zero Golden Blocks and move up as you win more races.

There are also a number of multiplayer modes - with or without CPU cars. The game supports 4-way link-up.</resource>

    <resource id="59b6174a8a9fc07dc65131dbc7a69d2ceb1cfd18" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Lara Croft discovers a manuscript which speaks of a mysterious occult magic which will bring desolation on earth in the near future. This prophecy also talks of three legendary stones which are linked with the mentioned devastation. Fascinated, Lara travels around the globe in search of these fabled stones. Along the way she'll meet enemies both human and otherwise and will also have to deal with dark magic of sorts.

Lara is now in a &amp;quot;quasi-3D&amp;quot; overhead environment, as opposed to the 2D-platformer view of the previous handheld (GBC) versions. This view proves helpful while Lara runs, jumps, shimmys, and shoots around. Although there is lack of a save feature, there is a password system which lets you restore back to 'almost' where you left.</resource>

It was developed by Krome Studios and published by Sierra Entertainment for the PlayStation 2, Xbox, GameCube and Game Boy Advance. Amaze Entertainment developed the Nintendo DS version.

The game utilizes the voices of celebrities, featuring Elijah Wood as the voice of Spyro, comedian David Spade as Sparx, Cree Summer as Cynder and Gary Oldman as Ignitus. Krome Studios planned to make a Crash Bandicoot game, but Sierra Entertainment asked them to develop The Legend of Spyro instead. The game has also been noted for beginning a more dark and complex plot to the Spyro series. Its success spawned two sequels and a planned CGI movie.</resource>

She is an apprentice witch, living in the common world of today, who has to live through different adventures.

The story: During a witch meeting, a lightning bolt struck and broke a crystal ball in seven parts, causing the witches to go mad. Bibi Blocksberg now has find all the parts to put them together and to restore the witches' mental health.

The game is an action-adventure. The seven levels, each corresponding to one witch and one part of the crystal ball, are full of monsters which hurt Bibi when she touches them. The health can be restored by finding sweets hidden in the level. Apart of monsters, there are persons which help her. In each level there is a magical item, often reachable only after getting through a little &amp;quot;game in game&amp;quot;, that expands Bibi's magical powers, for example the broom that allows her to fly. The magic has to be used sparsely, because it costs magical energy, which can be recharged by finding little pulsating dots. This magical item is needed to get to the witch of the level, which Bibi has to fight. If she wins, the witch gets back to normal, gives her a part of the crystal ball and Bibi can go the the next level.

There also is a password system that allows the player to jump to different situations in the game, so that one does not have to play it through in one session.</resource>

Now trapped in the world that he himself created, but someone else is now drawing, Sketch must battle through the pages of his own comic book, and past his own creations, to a final battle with Mortus. Perhaps one of his own creations, General Alissa Cyan might be able to help...

Comix Zone is a side-scrolling fighting game with a difference, you're inside of a comic book and you yourself know it. Smash enemies into the sides of frames, rip through the paper to unleash a super move and otherwise wreck havoc throughout the limitations of the graphic novel. Sketch himself can jump, attack and use various items that he finds along the comic book, including his rat friend, Roadkill. Button combinations can be used to unleash powerful techniques.

The game progresses linear through each page of the comic book, however secret paths and alternate routes through the story can be discovered. At the end of each level, Sketch receives a super hero rating for how well he's progressing.</resource>

The GBA version was licensed separately, and only the characters remind of the Crazy Frog world. The typical music and soundbites are not present.

Only singleplayer is available, and no story at all. The main game modes are Grand Prix, two modes based on checkpoints (alone or against opponents), and Last Man Standing where the last one drops after each lap. Grand Prix consists of three classes based on different speed, with three cups each, and and extra cup. Controls allow for speeding up, braking, using items to hinder your opponents (mines, nails, boxing gloves...), and there is a button to drift through the corners. Record times can be saved on the Battery Backed RAM.</resource>

This project was previusly unknown, until an auction for its prototype was posted on Ebay in June 2009. As we can read from the item description:

Original promo/sample game was never released or completed, game is playable but only around 30% complete. Very good graphics for Gameboy Advance, you have a world map, a castle you can go to and a village. Ingame text is Japanese, developer most probably Marvelous Entertainment.
The developers used some real photos (as one of Mel Gibson from the Braveheart film) as placeholders for the characters avatars in the game, before the final ones were finished. The gameplay would have probably been like a traditional RPG / SRPG, and looking at one of the photos added in the auction it seems that there were some 3D scenes too (maybe for the combats?).</resource>

The Saxons and the Normans blame each other and fight for control of England.

After a short introduction by Robin of Locksley himself, you start the game with a single castle and 10 soldiers at your command. From there, you have to build your army, take control of additional territories and fight the three Norman lords - and sometimes your Saxon friends as well.

The game has several different styles: You may either engage in a jousting contest where you have to knock your opponent off his horse using a lance, you can go raid a castle for loot or you can attack another territory/castle.

The game was originally created on the Amiga platform in 1986 by Cinemaware with wonderful graphics by James D. Sachs and great music by Jim Cuomo, then ported to the PC whilst keeping its original appeal and quality.</resource>

The game content is exactly the same, but it features a multiplayer mode between other systems (if they have a copy of the game and the GBA Link Cable, of course) and a brand new storyline: the player controls a F-14 pilot chosen by the US government to be assigned in the theater of operations of a war between the republics of China and Taiwan to protect America's &amp;quot;interests&amp;quot; in the region.

The game includes, apart from the previously mentioned multiplayer mode, a landing practice mode, like Turn and Burn. It was later implemented in Majesco's two following GBA flight sims, 2004's Super Hornet F/A-18F and 2007's F24 Stealth Fighter, which re-used this game's engine, with the option of selecting between a landing carrier or a landing strip.</resource>

Main hero Zeke, armed with a magical lantern called the Beacon of Souls, moves about the mansion environment, captures the 999 ghosts, solves puzzles and restores light to rooms.</resource>

Super Show, all three Sonic cartoons, The Real Ghostbusters) of the same name, Inspector Gadget Racing is a racing game developed by Bit Managers that is similar to games like the Mario Kart series, Vivid Image's Street Racer and other kart racing games for the SNES and Game Boy Advance. Selectable characters include Inspector Gadget (with both the Gadget Van and Gadget Mobile), Penny/Sophie (in a 4X4 truck), Brain (in an ice cream truck), Chief Quimby (in a police car), Dr. Claw, Agent Abdul (in a truck) and Agent Bruce.

The characters have their own power ups, for example Penny/Sophie has a shield, Gadget has his Gadget Mallet and Agent Bruce has an oil slick Spy Hunter-style. They can still pick up other power-ups, like missiles, bubblegum (to slow down an opponent), a shield and others. The game also has land-based courses, air-based courses and underwater-based courses

The game has multiple languages, like LSP's other Inspector Gadget game for the Game Boy Advance, Inspector Gadget: Advance Mission (English, Spanish, German, French, Italian and Dutch)</resource>

Pond has been armed with an Inspector Gadget-style stretch device, which he can use to view higher areas or claw onto ceilings so as to slide across them. The gameplay takes place across worlds themed around particular types of toys, such as sporting goods, candy and aircraft. The levels scroll sideways, although a small amount of vertical movement is included. On each level Pond must collect 2 penguins and reach the exit, although there are usually multiple exits and lots of secret areas to explore. After completing each pair of two worlds (each of which has three sub levels), a boss must be faced.</resource>

Have you ever imagined surfing at different remote locations around the world? Well, Kelly Slater takes you around the world on his boat to surf some of the more famous beaches. With a control scheme similar to all the other Activision O2 brand games, it's easy to jump into the game and surf. 

PS2, XB, and GC description, further below is the GBA description.

Game Play Modes:
Infinite Time - With no clock, no objectives, and nobody around, this gives you the best opportunity to just enjoy the surf. 

High Score - With 3 minutes, how high of a score can you get?

Icon Challenge - See how many icons you can collect and how high of a score you can get before time runs out.

Career Mode - Select a surfer and journey around the world to surf the best waves on the best beaches. As you progress you will unlock new beaches, new surf boards, and new tricks which will be usable in all the other modes of play.

Multiplayer Modes:
Push - Two players surf simultaneously in an attempt to &amp;quot;push&amp;quot; the split screen towards their opponent's half of the screen. As you score points the screen gets pushed more. The winner is decided once one player is pushed from the screen.

Head to Head - Similar to Push but the screen is stationary and the winner is the person with the highest points when the time runs out.

Time Attack - Players take turns to achieve the most points possible. The more points you get the less time is alloted to your opponent.

The Pros in the game: Kelly Slater, Lisa Andersen, Tom Carroll, Tom Curren, Nathan Fletcher, Donavon Frankenreiter, Bruce Irons, Rob Machado, Kalani Robb, and some other secret characters.

The beaches in the game: Sebastian, Trestles, Mavericks, Antarctica, Jaws, Pipeline, Teahupoo, Bells, Curren's Point, Kirra, G-Land, J-Bay, Mundaka, Cortez Bank, and perhaps some other tucked-away hide-aways.

The PS2 version of the game also includes a playable demo of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4

GBA description

Surf Modes:
Championship - Compete against 8 other surfers. You progress by surfing in 12 stages, 3 heats per stage. Your surf score is tallied from each heat and the top 3 surfers of the stage get to move on.

Challenge - Pick a surfer and do challenges around the world.

Drop In - Instant action surfing - go and just surf.

Multiplayer - With a Link Cable and another copy of the game you and a friend can link up to compete against each other.

The Pros are the same as above.

The beaches in the game: Sebastian, Trestles, Mavericks, Waimea Bay, Jaws, Pipeline, Teahupoo, Bells, Curren's Point, Kirra, G-Land, J-Bay, Mundaka, Cortez Bank, and perhaps some other tucked-away hide-aways.</resource>

To gain the 3-D effect, some detail gets sacrificed. Usually this is no problem, but occasionally you'll have a tough time recognizing an object. You move from area to area to engage a new group of enemies. You'll conveniently find crates for cover and barrels to help you pull off big explosions. Locking the enemy in your crosshairs, signified by your crosshairs turning red, doesn't guarantee a direct hit? The accuracy depends on the weapon of choice. A shotgun will normally provide a kill on the first shot. If you have an automatic rifle, your shots are relatively inaccurate even if your aim is true.</resource>
