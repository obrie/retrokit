    <resource id="9f0fc8430df71b8e6f40f1a8e7d187bbbac8b822" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">4 Wheel Thunder is the off-road racing sequel to the popular power-boat racing game, Hydro Thunder.  In this game, players race around two types of courses; huge outdoor tracks and smaller indoor tracks. All in all, there are 24 areas in which to race, including various day/night, rain/sunshine variations. The game includes the standard championship, practice race, and 2-player modes.

The thunder series of games is unique in that the key to winning the race lies not in careful steering and braking, but in finding the &amp;quot;boost&amp;quot; power-ups that lie around the tracks.  Each boost icon adds a few seconds of time to your boost meter. The player then can press a boost button to increase the speed of his or her truck dramatically. Without the boost power-ups, the player has no hope of winning a race.</resource>

    <resource id="2d6c1f10765733b8ccaa8f3e1fd2680f912a3ad9" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">4x4 Evolution is a racing game featuring real-life pickup trucks and SUV's.  Actual trucks from manufacturers such as Chevrolet, Ford, Dodge, Nissan, Toyota and more are included. 

The actual racing game is based very heavily on Terminal Reality's Monster Truck Madness series of games, except with SUV's instead of monster trucks.

One significant feature of 4x4 Evo is the online multi-player option.  The Dreamcast, PC, and Macintosh versions can compete against each other in 4 player online races.

In addition to the on-line mode of play, there is a single player career mode.  The career mode gives you a small allotment of money with which to purchase a truck. You then can compete in races to earn more money for more trucks or performance parts for your current truck.</resource>

Through soul reincarnation, you are going to play out Yuuichi's memories, but in order to return the memories of his soul, it is necessary to have someone in your heart that you really want to meet. The story goes back to the memories of his 3rd year of high school until the day of his accident. The second is the awakening of Yuuichi in a hospital, but in the body of the heroine chosen in the first part. You want to tell people that you are still alive, but since you are not really you, it is quite difficult. Time is running out before the soul decides to merge, 2 souls cannot occupy the same body, the one that does not merge will disappear, and if Yuuichi's soul merges, he will continue to live in that body.</resource>

While there is peace between the races, there is no sense of unity. This all changes when, without warning, a bio-mechanical Armada wages war on the whole of humanity. Now as a starship captain representing one of the six main races of humanity, your charge is to take the fight to the Armada and save humanity.

Gameplay consists of commanding a starship as you explore the universe, taking out Armada opposition where you see it. Along the way you can take missions and answer calls for help which will provide you with valuable experience and credits to upgrade your ship. In this way, you can build your strength until you are ready to take on the Armada full force in an attempt to end the threat once and for all.</resource>

-Asteroids
-Asteroids Deluxe
-Battlezone
-Centipede
-Crystal castles
-Gravitar
-Millipede
-Missile Command
-Pong
-Super Breakout
-Tempest
-Warlords
In addition to the pure emulation mode, there is an option that allows to display the original terminal around the game screen, which reinforces the impression of playing on an arcade machine. Each game allows you to activate a graphics improvement mode (variable depending on the game), for example &amp;quot;improved&amp;quot; Asteroids simply offers a static background, or &amp;quot;improved&amp;quot; Warlords offers a complete graphic overhaul with new colors. It should be noted that the improved version of Tempest is none other than Tempest Tubes, a Tempest mod designed in 1982 by Duncan Brown.
Also included is a gallery of game images, a video interview with Nolan Bushnell, and desktop themes for Windows.</resource>

Sorry to rush you out of training school, but we have full confidence in your abilities. You are fighting for the future of our cultures and the heritage of your Arikhan warrior ancestry. The Alliance is being invaded by the Sektar and their bloodthirsty allies, the Morgoths. While for years we have held them, their numbers are wearing us down. We must take the offensive soon. That is where you come in...

Bang! Gunship Elite is an action game where you shoot a lot of enemies all by yourself, in the vein of Wing Commander or Freespace, but with the action turned up and tactics turned down. Add spectacular graphics, lots of &amp;quot;power-ups&amp;quot; (dropped by dead enemies or left in space by your supply ships), and you have a pretty good looking shooter. The game is mouse driven with keyboard inputs for things like speed and weapon selection. The plot is your typical &amp;quot;fight against all odds&amp;quot; story.</resource>

Some of the existing cutscenes were also redone and the character of Steve Burnside was given a different hairstyle. The unlockable Battle Game from the original edition is now available by default and a Very Easy difficulty setting was added in which the player starts the game off with a Rocket Launcher.

The mini games invariably involve Pavlovian button tapping, repetitive pattern matching, and fairly simple button sequencing to succeed. Drawn in a wavering childish scrawl, the visuals help to convey a feel of a dreamy netherworld, both tenuous and seemingly fleeting in it's existence.</resource>

It was released in North America and Europe in June 2000 for the PlayStation, Dreamcast and Microsoft Windows' PCs. It is named after the famous Caesars Palace luxury hotel and casino on the Las Vegas Strip in Las Vegas, Nevada.

Interplay announced in late 1999 that they were working on a title for the Dreamcast which was known to be a 3D simulation of gambling with traditional casino games. The game was fully licensed by the Caesars Palace casino and features six card games, table games, five slot machine themes, and video game machines.

    <resource id="0f13cdd64834e33905134821d07fdfe633732e1b" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Carrier is the first survival horror game released for the Dreamcast.  As the game starts you are Jack Ingles, a member of a special forces team.  You are sent in by Helicopter to investigate a carrier that has not been responding to radio contact after completing a mission. As you approach the deck of the carrier, your helicopter is shot down.  After crash landing on the deck, it is your job to investigate what exactly is going on, and escape alive.

The game is played from a third person perspective.  You move Jack around the ship, shooting enemies and solving simple puzzles along the way.  The main goal of the game is to survive, so you have to be careful about conserving ammo and health upgrades.  After you solve the game playing as Jack, you can play through the game again as Jessifer Manning, one of your teammates.  While playing as Jessifer, you get an entirely different view of the same story.</resource>

Gameplay progresses through five &amp;quot;worlds&amp;quot;:  Weedom, Frostonia, Infernium, Enigma, and Evile.  Players blast away at the classic centipedes, spiders, fleas, and scorpions while fighting new enemies like the mosquito, cockroach, and killer mushroom.  A &amp;quot;classic&amp;quot; mode is also included, which allows players to play the classic game in a new &amp;quot;3D&amp;quot; isometric perspective.</resource>

You control one of three ships, each with their own pilot and unique weapon systems. The game takes place over 5 phases, in each phase you face a number of boss battles. Unlike other games if this genre, almost the entire game is composed of boss battles, each boss requiring a different strategy to defeat.
The game also uses a unique in-game difficulty adjuster. Called &amp;quot;fields&amp;quot;, you can play in either Order or Chaos. Compared to Order, the Chaos Field offers you increased fire power and abilities, but also does the same for your enemies. Order Field is more relaxed on both sides. If you can play in the Chaos Field, you stand to gain substantially more points.</resource>

It is developed and distributed by the Vivarium studio, like its predecessor Seaman: Kindan no Pet. (Which we will come back to later).
The game is akin to a Tamagochi. So you are going to raise Seaman, a strange half-human, half-fish / amphibian animal. The special thing is that the game is developed to be used with a microphone! Thus, you will interact vocally with your protégé and you will evolve him, going from an aquarium (fish) to a vivarium (frog) and thus make him more intelligent.</resource>

You have indirect control over mice, and must guide them to the safety of a rocket, and away from a cat. You do this by placing arrows on the ground, which they will follow. The multi-player game is a frantic all-against-all duel, in which each player's mice will only follow instructions of their own colour. You can play this mode on your own against CPU opponents, or take on a series of predefined puzzles</resource>

The construction part is set up with a screen divided in four camera angles and a grid based building tool. Using vector pieces, the player has to make a roller coaster that meets the requirements of the specific park. The pieces can be tilted, elevated, lowered and turned to make sure the ride is as exciting as possible.
After the roller coaster is done it will be tested with a crash test dummy (who's also able to squeal like an excited kid), to make sure it meets such requirements as safety, speed, excitement etc. This is done in a 1st person view, allowing the player to come along for the ride as well.
There are 6 different stages, each with different sizes and limitations.</resource>

You decide Kazuki's schedule, as he prepares for the once-a-month Comic Party. How quickly Kazuki can complete his dōjinshi, how many copies he can sell at each convention, and which girl he's able to date out depends on the player's choices. Only one action can be chosen each day of the week, as Kazuki has to go to college during the day, and 2 actions can be chosen on weekends as well as the choice to leave the house and contact the girl he wishes to conquer. During the game, Kazuki will come into contact with other characters. These phases consist of dialogue and actions. At times, the player will be asked to choose multiple actions that can affect the person's feelings and can lead to other events.</resource>

The game includes the popular features of the Virtua Cop series &amp;quot;Justice Shot&amp;quot; (in which you shoot an enemy's gun or gun arm instead of killing them) and the &amp;quot;Combo Shot&amp;quot; in which you can hit an enemy with up to three shots before they expire. The home version does include some mini-games and training modes that were not in the arcade version of the game.</resource>

The player takes control of Hyde, an adventurous lad who has a knack for exploring dungeons in search of relics from the old world. One day, he arrives at the town called Arvil where he hears a rumor about a nearby unexplored cave. He heads there determined to find new relics, not minding the fact that noone's been there in ages and the place is probably infested with monsters. To his surprise, he doesn't discover and relic or a treasure, but instead, a mysterious girl named Yura. She has apparently lost her memory and can't remember anything but her name.</resource>

    <resource id="772627a1115cfd0b92a77754c88549ad0963fe76" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Momohime is a young girl who was found inside a giant peach as a child. She is traveling with her friends, hoping to learn more about where she came from. They have heard of another mysterious young girl named Nayotake who lives in the capital, and are heading there to see if there is any connection, but when they reach the capital they find it under attack by strange creatures! Just what is going on, and is there any connection between Momohime, Nayotake, and the mysterious creatures? Dancing Blade is an anime FMV game. The player simply watches each scene as it proceeds; the only interaction is occasionally selecting dialogue choices when prompted. Depending on the player's choices, they will reach one of four different endings. Once an ending is reached, the scenario leading to that ending can later be replayed without interruption. Any scene already viewed can also be freely revisited.</resource>

A pounding music soundtrack kicks in as you are slapped into your car to await the green light. The game offers both a traditional arcade mode with checkpoint time splits and a special PC mode that pits you against the other cars over different race distances. The PC mode also offers more car choices, with a variety of speed, acceleration, and grip characteristics. It even rewards successful players (meaning those finishing first, second, or third in the difficult setting) by offering up to ten more upgraded cars to drive. Once underway, the goal is to work from last to first as smoothly and quickly as possible

The player can choose the role of one of two dalmatians, Oddball or Domino, who are out in the backyard looking for treasure. It is not long before the player realizes that a toy found buried in a park was made at one of Cruella de Vil's toy factories; this alludes to the fact that Cruella's toy sales are down, which ultimately leads to the problem in the storyline. Facing financial ruin from lack of sales, Cruella sets an evil plan in motion - to reprogram her toys to capture any pets in sight. Oddball and Domino are the only puppies in their family who have not been captured when they return from the park. Their parents, Dottie and Dipstick, set out to rescue their puppies, commanding Oddball and Domino to stay home and 'be good.' The puppies do not listen, and are soon out on their biggest adventure yet - to save their brothers and sisters, and their parents who are captured along the way.</resource>

You control three characters: Flia the pteradon, Aladar the Iguanadon and Zini the lemur, each of whom has different abilities. Flia can fly, Aladar can wade through water and crush rocks and Zini can fit through small spaces and pick things up. The game is seen from a top-down perspective, with the player switching characters on the fly. As in the movie, they must work together to reach the sacred nesting grounds for water and food after the rest of world dries up.
Throughout the game, the characters' abilities are upgraded via an Intelligent Points System in an RPG-like addition. There are twelve levels divided into four acts. The game includes FMV clips from the movie and a dinosaur encyclopedia with information about real dinosaurs.</resource>

You were discovered by an archaeological team, and an ancient machine, which was dubbed &amp;quot;Elemental Gimmick Gear&amp;quot; by the archaeologists, was found near you. You are a young man, but in fact you are several thousand years old. Now you must discover your past, the past of the planet, and the purpose of the mysterious Elemental Gear. This game is an action RPG. The player can move around the battlefield, using various physical attacks, such as punch, spin, etc., and also elemental (magic-like) spells. The game is mostly 2D, except the boss battles, which are in full 3D. There are also many puzzle-solving areas and mini-games included within the game.</resource>

You play as Ryouichi Katsuragi, a young doctor and a family physician summoned to tend to an old man living in a huge mansion on the island in Italy. Upon arriving to the island in a helicopter, the game switches to 3rd-person perspective where you can freely explore the mansion and its surroundings and interact with various characters, including the mansion maids which act as heroines in this story. During 1st-person perspective mode, the game plays like a typical visual novel where you converse with other characters which are non-animated but feature voice-acting. The player choices during dialogues affect the story and key choices branch it toward a different ending. The bonus features which are accessible from the main menu are music player and unlockable heroine gallery.</resource>

There are realistic physics, a telemetry system to analyse behaviour of your car and to tune its settings, complex driving AI, recordable replays, strategy management with animated pit sequences, weather simulation, and LAN support for multiplayer games.</resource>

When the latter closed the closet door behind him, the little girl woke up and went inside in turn. Projected into a magical world filled with monsters and oddities, the little girl will have to explore this universe, help the monsters, find her Teddy and maybe return to the real world ... To help you there is Mr Mouche, very practical for access objects inaccessible to the little girl. He is a nice little fly, very courteous, and Mr Chat, he has a bad temper, nevertheless he is useful for accessing confined places and small galleries. You just have to stroke it in the direction of the hair. This game is a revival of Point'N Click with hand-made pixel art graphics, pixel after pixel, an adventure divided into 3 Chapters containing dozens of puzzles with several parallel quests and no dialogues. Puzzles and Music are the main points of the game.</resource>

Entertainment. It is based on the 2000 film of the same name, itself based on Hanna-Barbera's The Flintstones franchise. This Dreamcast adaptation was a kart racer, similar to others at the time, featuring various characters and environments from the movie. A notable thing is that, while based on a live-action movie, the game's look is more in line with that of the original Flintstones cartoons, as well as powerups being obtained through knocking bowling pins, also a nod towards the show.

Hoigle is the elder of the two. He's also the smaller of the two, and by far the smarter. In this game you control Hoigle as he helps his large but slow-witted younger brother Moigle to build a secret invention. Floigan Bros. is an adventure game with a strong emphasis on cooperation. Hoigle must work with Moigle to accomplish many tasks. Moigle, on the other hand, is more frequently interested in playing games or eating. By playing with Moigle, Hoigle can eventually teach him the skills he needs to get the job done. Floigan Bros. featured some online content that was downloadable using the Dreamcast's built-in modem.</resource>

Most of the events take place in high-school during your senior year. The story and love interest will change depending whether you play as a boy or a girl. During the conversation, you are occasionally presented with the choice selection that decide the direction the remaining story take. Originally for Dreamcast platform, this game was soon ported to Windows with several updates. However, PlayStation 2 release features yet more additional updates which include full voice-acting, renewed videos and art, new CG events and 2 new characters.</resource>

It may sound odd, and to be fair, to a western audience it certainly does come across that way (it's also an example of the sub genre of 'BL' game, or 'Yaoi', which concentrate on romantic relationships between only male characters, written and designed primarily by female gamers, and a sub genre of games that sadly never would of sold to a western audience). Angels and demons both make an appearance, with your character tasked with creating the perfect fragrance which will end the age old war between the two forces, with the usual mix of love simulation and visual novel elements making the game a difficult one for those who can't handle the large amount of Japanese text.</resource>

In contrast to most games of this type, there is a story. A crazed giant robot has kidnapped your skating buddies. By completing skating challenges at the robot's sky fortress, you must rescue your friends. You skate around 3 large areas and attempt to perform wild tricks, collect scooter wheels, and earn bonus time. By completing an objective on all 3 areas, you unlock a sky fortress level in which you can rescue a new skater to control. Gameplay is based heavily on the Tony Hawk series of games. Tricks consist of button and direction presses, and can be strung together with grinds to create high-scoring combos.</resource>

On top of that, the river that runs through it is regularly poisoned, which puts the villagers in a difficult situation. Fortunately Asuka the warrior decides to help them by going to the ninja village. The adventure begins! The setting of the game is medieval Japan, with creatures straight from Japanese mythology as the bestiary. You will move in rice fields, swamps, caves beating moles, Kappa, frogs, ninjas, etc…. The atmosphere and the graphics immerse you in a childish world full of shimmering colors but the difficulty is not for the kids! The music, a mixture of classical and traditional Japanese music is pleasant and contributes to the atmosphere of the Japanese medieval fantasy world.</resource>

Based on the 1999 UK season, the game allows the player to take control of any team in the UK's Premier league, Divisions One, Two or Three, or the Conference league. The game has three levels of difficulty. In the easy level the player's club has a wealthy benefactor who makes Â£25m available, in the medium setting Â£25m is still available, but two other clubs in the league also receive the same cash injection. In the hard mode there is no extra cash available.</resource>

Based on the 1999 UK season, the game allows the player to take control of any team in the UK's Premier league, Divisions One, Two or Three, or the Conference league. The game has three levels of difficulty. In the easy level the player's club has a wealthy benefactor who makes Â£25m available, in the medium setting Â£25m is still available, but two other clubs in the league also receive the same cash injection. In the hard mode there is no extra cash available.</resource>

There are four characters to choose from, each with his own storyline and fighter/spaceship. Each ship has its own weapon type and speed. Like the previous Giga Wing and Mars Matrix games, gameplay is designed around bullet absorption/reflection mechanics, large numbers of enemies, and giant boss fights. Giga Wing 2 adds the ability to choose from two different bullet reflection powers: reflect force and reflect laser. The reflect force repulses enemy shots, while the reflect laser uses them to charge up a beam weapon.</resource>

The game also features a dodge and a lock-on mechanic. The gameplay is divided in two kinds of levels. The first style features Godzilla rampaging through a Japanese city and taking down all kinds of military devices which try to stop him. The second kind of level is a fight between Godzilla and other giant monsters from the various films.</resource>

Walls will move in different ways depending on the gates they are connected to, either rotating around a gate or moving forward one space.

Only the last of them will present a challenge for those who cannot read Japanese, as the rest of the game is mostly in English. Everything is simple, never reaching the complexity of the most serious golf games on DC, it's a charming title with enough challenge to entertain avid golfers.</resource>

    <resource id="b8baee696ce1127292c9753927f6e7175886afba" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Based on the Heavy Metal world created by Kevin Eastman and Simon Bisley, this fighting title allows you to take control of a team of three fighters, ranging from a basic all-rounder, or a lightning fast female to a huge bulky mass of power. Of course, they are all a mix of human and humanoid, and depending on their strengths, have a range of different moves and styles.

The main aim of the game is to defeat each of the opposing 3-man teams ahead of you, and dominate cyberspace.
The game mixes a little of Street Fighter with a dash of Virtual On, allowing you to fight in close or use long range attacks all inside a 3D landscape.</resource>

While there are many heroines included, this game's premise is more that of a mystery novel than a romance. The story takes place in present time during your reunion with your childhood friends, as well as during past time during your childhood days.

The art style in this game is rather unique in comparison to typical visual novel anime art style. The background art uses somewhat a mix of a life-like re-touched images and anime drawings. While characters use voice-acting in this Dreamcast exclusive visual novel, the animation is non-existent during dialogues. The bonus content features unlockable heroine albums which can be accessed via main menu.</resource>

The game uses a auto game camera which pans around in a preset manner as you venture through the city killing the creatures and rescuing people. Extra modes like training and time trial are included for replayability.</resource>

Based on a two-colors system, the player has to switch between the black &amp; white sides of his ship during gameplay.
The black side is immune to black enemy bullets which it consider as bonus, and dies on impact with a white enemy bullets. Your own black bullets damages white enemies twice as more as white bullets. And vice-versa for the white side. Those properties makes a balance between protecting yourself well and killing enemies fast.
This aspect, combined with specific enemy patterns and a combo system makes Ikaruga an original shoot-em-up with a dose of strategy.</resource>

Each of the agents has his own specialties, like computer hacking, rollerblading, handguns, etc.

Gameplay is like a regular real-time strategy game, with the player acting in the role of commander without taking a direct hand in anything. Give the agents orders and try to keep an eye on all of them as they carry them out. Each agent's skills can be upgraded after missions. Keep them out of sight of guards, spring traps on them, or engage them in hand-to-hand or ranged combat.

In previous games, Ryouko was your guest in her role as a transfer student, but the roles are reversed during the last roommate. Gameplay ensues in the form of animated chat screens where action and speaking options are presented to the player. Say or do the right thing and the world is yours. Act like a fool and anything you get will be a disaster.</resource>

    <resource id="2c9ab4840d54ac7c2165e79cc7a58aad1bd69a18" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Based around the concept of falling blocks, much like the Columns, Lumines or Tetris, Irides is a puzzle action game with some clever twists around conventional ideas. A 2 x 2 square (an O tetromino) made of four smaller block pieces is dropped into the playing field, which may appear different as the player advances through levels or skins. The small blocks that comprise the larger blocks will be one of two different colors. The objective is to rotate and align the blocks in such a way as to create 2x2 squares of the same color, which may span multiple blocks and, indeed, share blocks. For example, if one should get a 2x3 area of matching blocks, the middle portion will &amp;quot;share&amp;quot; itself with both the left and right halves and create two 2x2 squares. When too many unmatched blocks pile up to the point where no more blocks may be dropped in the playing field, the game ends.
All the Skins in Irides have an outer space theme.

What that &amp;quot;fictional&amp;quot; means is that great liberties have been taken with the historical accuracy of the world and events. The most obvious point is that although most planes come from real World War 2 aircraft, the theatre of operations is a bit unique; The four major sides to the conflict (American, British, German, Japanese) are all fighting one another over a group of islands somewhere in the Pacific. Thus each of these nations is represented in close proximity and in direct conflict to one another.

The gameplay takes place over a series of single-player flight missions in which your American pilot will fight against the Axis forces and ally with the British. The majority of the missions take place in the air against other aerial targets.</resource>

You build your team, your colors, your location, then hire and fire staff and players to be successful.

The game is viewed in detailed 3D, allowing you to rotate the table at all angles, either from overhead or using the cue position as a base. Taking a shot involves setting the exact pace and spin of it, and considering what each contact will do to the position of the cue ball, and any balls you may wish to pot afterwards. In the snooker mode playing accurate 'safety' shots (to prevent your opponent scoring) becomes important as well).

In each mode there are 10 computer opponents, and matches can consist of up to 9 frames. A trick-shot editor is also included, allowing you to practice shots and set up challenges. Replays and an undo mode are also included. Bonus games are included as well - darts, draughts, a fruit machine, and even a remake of Dropzone, a Commodore 64 game from the same programmer.</resource>

This town is his home. He left it seven years ago, and now he came back. He has left many memories in this town, has made many promises, which are now as vague as the image of the snowy town. Now, as he meets again the inhabitants of the town, particularly the girls with whom he had different kinds of relationship, the memories come back to haunt him...

&amp;quot;Kanon&amp;quot; is a &amp;quot;digital romance&amp;quot;, formally belonging to hentai style, but much softer in its erotic content. The original PC version contains nude images, but a later censored PC version as well as the Dreamcast and PS2 releases are suitable for all ages. The game is controlled in a standard fashion of Japanese adventures: you interact with people by making decisions during conversations, and choose commands from several available ones.</resource>

    <resource id="e5252a49c84ed05e734eb95108eeaca043291b6d" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">A kangaroo named Kao was playing with his friends in his native Australia, when suddenly evil hunters appeared, put him in a cage, and took him away. They didn't know that Kao was quite proficient in the art of boxing, so freeing himself from the trap wasn't particularly hard. However, Kao finds himself far away from home, and must fight and hop his way back.

Kao the Kangaroo is a 3D platform action game. The gameplay adheres to the jump-and-run style, Kao having to rapidly traverse levels full of traps and enemies. His basic attack is a simple punch; he can also side-step and swing his tail at the enemies. Power-ups scattered through the stages include coins, a certain amount of which will increase Kao's life points; hearts to replenish his health; boxing gloves, which act as homing projectile attacks; and turbo boosts, which make Kao move faster.</resource>

    <resource id="4f044045ea9fcaa208be943eeb1b5b2afb71dfe9" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">In this unique vertically-scrolling shooter you take the role of a mysterious girl named Karous, who commands a tiny fighter ship and attempts to destroy an evil armada bent on world domination.
The game plays as your average vertical-scrolling shooter, in which you must clear several stages by destroying all incoming enemies and surviving their onslaught. A unique addition to Karous, is that you don't collect weapons by power-ups, but instead upgrade each of your basic weapons (gun, sword and shield) depending on their use thanks to a basic experience module, with increased power and features at later levels (multiple shots, bullet reflection, etc.)
The game uses cel-shaded polygonal graphics with a distinct black and white look.</resource>

The story takes place in a small rural area around the seaside town called Sakuragi-cho. The protagonist returns from Tokyo to spend the summer in a town which brings him a lot of nostalgic memories. But after being absent for so long, unaware about the current events in the town, the summer vacations may not be so carefree and relaxing as you expect them to be.

The Dreamcast port was release two years after initial Windows release, and is adjusted for consoles as it removes all the adult content. It adds however new CG events to the gameplay and also includes bonus drama disc. There is also a DVD-Player game release which is more similar to the original game and features all the adult content.</resource>

Things start in Nadesico: The Mission with an incredible animated intro. Then you move on the Nadesico ship, conversing with the different characters, until you receive a call from Ruri to introduce you to the bridge. Once you get to the bridge, Ruri notifies you of an event that has occurred at a remote location. The game switches to a navigation grid, from which you can move the Nadesico ship through space. If you go to the area suggested by Ruri, a battle will usually ensue; succeed in the battle and you will find yourself stepping on the Nadesico.</resource>

Its gameplay requires little player interaction as much of the game's duration is spent on reading the text that appears on the screen, which represents the story's narrative and dialogue. The text is accompanied by character sprites, which represent who Takayuki is talking to, over background art. Throughout the game, the player encounters CG artwork at certain points in the story, which take the place of the background art and character sprites. When the game is completed at least once, a gallery of the viewed CGs becomes available on the game's title screen. Rumbling Hearts follows a branching plot line with multiple endings, and depending on the decisions that the player makes during the game, the plot will progress in a specific direction.</resource>

The King of Fighters 2002 also has five characters exclusive to the X-Box, the PS2 and/or Dreamcast systems: Shingo Yabuki, King, Geese Howard, &amp;quot;Riot of the Blood&amp;quot; Iori and Leopold Goenitz. Shingo and King are available on all the non-Neo Geo systems, while Geese and the rest are only available on the PS2 and X-Box platforms.

The gameplay system has also changed. The striker system and four-character teams found in the last three KOF releases have been totally removed. In their place are the old-school three man teams and the &amp;quot;Advanced system&amp;quot; from The King of Fighters '97 and The King of Fighters '98.

It still revolves around Keitaro managing a house full of girls while trying to study for an entrance exam to a university he set his mind on some time ago. Naturally, distractions are plentiful and he will have his hands full. The game features original story from the franchise, and plays as an adventure visual novel with a rather original gameplay system. While you control your character through an isometric perspective, and talk to characters in a visual novel style by displaying their portraits over current background with full voice-overs for heroines during dialogues, dialogue and action choices are replaced with a command roulette system which requires good reflexes to select the wanted outcome.</resource>

It is thought to have been released around summer 2000. The demo allows players to race either an Opel Speedster or the UK model, the Vauxhall VX220 around a single track (Asakusa Japan) in either one or two player modes. The Speedster effectively became the signature car of MSR, featuring predominantly on the front cover and being the only car selectable in certain modes. The origins of Metropolis Street Racer Opel Challenge are currently unknown - it is estimated that roughly 200 copies of the disc were printed and were likely only used at trade events across Europe; the internal label for the known disc is &amp;quot;THIS IS A SAMPLE DISK FOR USE IN THE OFFICE ONLY DO NOT SELL DO NOT CARRY OUT FROM THE OFFICE&amp;quot;.</resource>

The game allows you to tag in all three players (instead of two, while the third is only used for special attacks, in the predecessor).
There are now up to 56 characters to use (most you have to unlock), including new characters like Jill Valentine from Resident Evil and Tron Bonne from Mega Man Legends.
Another new gameplay feature allows your team mates to come in during battle and give you a little health boost. This helps in lasting the distance in Survival mode, but they can also be hit by on coming attacks from the enemy.</resource>

You control Max, a superhero with the ability to turn invisible and punch through walls, as he valiantly halts the plans of the diabolical John Dread. Gameplay is similar to Fighting Force 2, as you lead Max through expansive levels pummeling your foes with bare fists. The game also features voice-overs by the cast of the television show, adding dramatic flair to the proceedings.

The game follows the story of Kenji Katase , a high-school student who lives with his adopted sister, Yuki . One day, Kenji's childhood friend, Hiyori Hayasaka , re-appears in his life and his long-gone feelings of affection toward her started to awaken.

As is the case with many romance-driven visual novels, your choices will determine how the story branches, and your actions will drive the story toward the heroine of your interest. While this console game version removed the adult content, it added additional character and story content with new CG events. As you play through the games, you unlock CG gallery for heroines which is accessible via main menu, along with the music player.</resource>

    <resource id="a5d8066b31ebddd41238419a13813a150f209ea9" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">My Merry May is the first game in a planned (but unfinished) trilogy, originally released for Dreamcast in 2002, followed by a PlayStation 2 port later that year. The story revolves around Kyousuke Watarase , a high-school student, who one day received a strange package. In that package was Reu, an AI android in a form of a young girl who ends up living with him under pretense of being his sister.

The game plays as a typical visual novel romance which includes reading on-screen text over background art and character sprites who come in different poses and gestures, but are not animated. Key moments feature special CG artwork to emphasize certain scene and break out from a typical &amp;quot;character sprite over background art&amp;quot; presentation. Aside from main characters, all the heroines feature full voice-acting. Player's choices allow the story to branch toward one of the several different endings, some endings focusing on your relationship with a specific heroine.</resource>

There are detailed statistics for each team and player, for a year, the current season or an entire career. The game modes include Exhibition, Season (play a full season along with management), Franchise (more than one season), some arcade street modes and the option to create custom tournaments.</resource>

Using players from the NBA, each player chooses a guard, forward, and center from the team's NBA roster for the first half and can make substitutions for the second half.

NBA Hoopz is an arcade-style game and not meant to be realistic: players can jump twenty or thirty feet in the air, dunk the ball from 20 feet (6.1 m) away, and do otherwise physically impossible things. Fouls are only called on flagrant pushes, foul shots are rare (and only after a number of fouls are accumulated), and there is no out of bounds. In addition, after a player makes three consecutive shots he becomes &amp;quot;on fire&amp;quot; which allows him to make almost any shot as well as goaltend without penalty.</resource>

It starts off a little weird, as the intro sees a spaceship, planets, and, uh, no chess at all. There is no doubt that this is linked to the functionality of the online game. On the menu of the game itself, it's simple menus, and while there is quite a bit of customization, everything is very basic. As the only chess title in DC, the game conveys the tactical vibe of chess well. Solo or 2 player always possible thanks to offline play.</resource>

Featuring anime-style graphics, it's very beautiful and the courses are lovely, with little touches like buildings reflecting in the water and falling leaves adding a plus.
Ditto for the designs of the courses, which are varied and difficult. The gameplay itself is pretty straightforward, all the usual club and shot type choices are present, but to shoot, just one movement of the analog stick down. It works surprisingly well, and complex shots can be done with a bit of skill. The game offers several single player modes and tournaments, as well as an online experience, the 1st online golf game for console.</resource>

Unlike most other installments of the series, it has less tactical elements and is more close to the traditional Japanese-style RPG format.

The story of the game is loosely based on Alexandre Dumas' famous novel The Count of Monte-Cristo. The game is set in a pseudo-European New Age environment (17th -19th centuries). The hero of the game, a young nobleman Cyrano Bernstein, is betrayed by his fiancee Mercedes and is captured by the evil warlock Cesare Borgia. After fleeing from the prison, Cyrano swears revenge, and sets off to find a legendary sword sealed on a nearby island and to recruit allies in order to get involved in a war between two powerful empires.</resource>

A couple of years later, the two of them meet by chance at a cafe Shougo was frequently visiting.

The following year the game was also released on Sega Saturn. Four years after its initial release, in 2001, the game was ported to Dreamcast, but the port removed all adult content and reduced rating to all ages. The game was released under the title Pia Carrot e Y?koso!! 2.5.

This is the second Dreamcast release which came two years after Pia Carrot e Y?koso!! 2.5 and changed the cover artwork and title back to Pia Carrot e Y?koso!! 2. It also includes a bonus mini-drama CD featuring story from Pia Carrot e Y?koso!! 3.</resource>

Like it's predecessor it was first released on Arcade before ported to the Dreamcast.

The game features 22 anime-like Characters in a 3-dimensional futuristic world - except for the backgrounds and the menus, which are plain 2D-bitmaps without a lot of movement. The stages are unlimited in all directions, so it's not possible to fall of the edge. The speciality of this game are the so called &amp;quot;plasma moves&amp;quot;, visually very appealing special moves filling the complete screen which can be executed when you have collected enough &amp;quot;plasma power&amp;quot;. Despite of the 22 characters there are only 11 different move layouts, as one layout is shared by two characters.

Each piece has weight (which increases as your opponent does combos), and the goal is to force your opponent's platform down. Added to this, the colors of the assigned piece can be changed.
Each color has a pair that it can be interchanged with during the drop. Once the combos are successful, the remaining pieces can also change color ... and that is, everything gets complicated.</resource>

The Dreamcast version includes all three heroines: Yumi Aida, Shizuka Houjouin, and Fumio Ueno. While the PSX version supports PocketStation, the Dreamcast version uses visual memory which also uses graphical representation of the character you are interacting with, and emphasizes what is currently happening on the main screen. You can meet the girls, buy them gifts, talk to them, check the progress status, and play various mini-games. The game also includes printed stickers of all three heroines with some additional artwork as well.</resource>

As in most aquatic racers, success here depends on your ability to smoothly handle unpredictable waves and aggressive competition at the same time.

There are several game modes to choose from.  First up is the Championship.  In this mode, you compete in a series of circuit races and accumulate points based on your finishing position.  The racer with the most points at the end of the season wins.  The other modes include a trick competition, a hazard and obstacle course, and a head-to-head 2-player mode.

The Monaco license is used, although the teams themselves are not licensed. A total of 22 camera views are provided.

Telemetry is stored and analysed in a similar way to Grand Prix 2, and physics are modeled to be realistic. There are eight different modes to race, the new ones being a career mode in which you start with a poor team and must drive well enough to earn competitive rides, and scenarios recreating key races for particular drivers. Returning from the first game are Time Attack, a full championship, and a 50s retro mode. There is also a track editor to create your own tracks.</resource>

Setting itself apart from many other top-down shooters on the system, the game features bright, cartoony, cell-shaded graphics. At the beginning, the player is given a choice of three different mecha-ships - one with a spread-gun, a weak homing laser, or a slow but powerful bubble gun. Additionally, each ship can use a sword for anything that gets too close, or specific enemies which can't be killed otherwise, a shield, which appears at the front of the ship once the player lets go of the fire button, and a smart-bomb-like field that can be extended around the player  in a small circle, damaging enemies, absorbing their shots and turning them into points.</resource>

You can train your character up to the best of his/her ability and then fight the best in the world for the championship belt. 

Round 2 adds some new play modes and characters into the mix of previous fighters. In this round, there are now 3 levels to the RUMBLE combo gauge (much like a Street Fighter game). Once you reach the third level, you can hit your enemy for six, out of the ring and into the crowd.

    <resource id="3d7cc7194017037f18df21eb2218d9a75d6ee274" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Mizu Sakura is a Tokyo elementary student who is transferred to a new school. There, she falls in love with a boy named Hiroshi Nonoichi. The two decide to elope together, fearing that nobody will accept their relationship at such a young age. However, Mizu never shows up for the meeting; a while later Hiroshi learns that she has been transferred to another school.

Several years have passed. Mizu is looking for a job and Hiroshi attends college. It looks like both have moved on with their lives. But their past catches up with them when they learn about a mysterious disappearance in the subway system.

Real Sound: Kaze no Regret is an audio game: it has no graphics or other visuals of any kind. Gameplay-wise, it is identical to visual novels, with written text and images being replaced by sound. The player listens to the voice-acted story, which is occasionally interrupted by a chime, prompting the player to make a decision and branch the plot.</resource>

    <resource id="b676082d13c12fb527b344ea104ab529eb7d5752" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">In this game the player takes the role of an ancient warrior who has been brought to life by the benevolent wizard Wart. It seems that the evil goddess Kardis is about to be resurrected by her faithful servants. The only way to stop them is to gather famous heroes from Lodoss War universe and to defeat the evil ones in a battle.

Record of Lodoss War is quite similar to  Diablo gameplay-wise. It is an action RPG which is heavily combat-oriented. You can directly control only the main hero, while the legendary heroes who join him on the quest are controlled by the AI. As you go through the game you level up, tweak your items with the great Ancients system, and gain new spells. It is also possible to froge weapons and to imbue them with runes. As your adventures into the surrounding land go on, you can return to your HQ, the Goblin Fortress, and get much needed healing and healing potions (free of charge).</resource>

Three years after their mother-ship first orbited the earth the Haak were invited to the surface in peace and in the search for mutual rewards.

This agreement has been upheld for 7 years with only the occasional backlash causing small localised human/Haak conflict but the Haak have kept up their end of the bargain - until now.

We have started to lose contact with the human installations around the Haak settlements.  The first three recon forces sent to investigate the disturbances were shot out of the air.  The Red Dog Tactical Response Team is now preparing for war.

As commander of the Red Dog assault vehicle, your job is to rid our people of the now aggressive Haak forces currently occupying the continents of planet earth.  Good Luck - Don't dent the tank!

The “Project K” Network has recently been upgraded to handle the rapid expansion of the information age and the core, known as “Eden,” holds the most advanced artificial intelligence the world has ever seen. Unfortunately, Eden cannot handle the ability to create her own thoughts and buckles under the pressure in an existential breakdown. She is lost deep inside the system, and you’re the only one that can bring her back online, saving the world from utter chaos.

You must blast complex viruses, unlock passwords, and destroy firewall bosses as you search for Eden. Each stage is in a constant state of flux dependent on your shooting techniques, which ultimately control the music and colors of your environment. The deeper you get into the dreamlike cyber world of Rez, your form will evolve or devolve depending on your progress.</resource>

Naturally, just letting the guy continue being a loser isn't particularly interesting, so a spirit that happens to also live in his apartment starts to toy with his daily life.

You can affect Neji in two different ways. If he's not around, you can interact with things in his apartment like moving his table, or locking his door. If he is around, you can throw little ping-pong balls at objects to focus his attention on them. If you throw too many too fast, though, he'll get depressed and ignore you.</resource>

Roommate Asami is a spin-off of Datam Polystar's Roommate series based on the manga Okusama wa Joshik? Sei (My Wife is a High School Student) by Hiyoko Kobayashi. The game is played in a standard visual novel mode from the teacher's perspective. Each day is divided into 4 segments, and at certain times it is possible to visit different places in the city, which will lead to different events. During conversations, there will be choices to be made from several responses, which will affect the flow of the story and thus different endings.
The &amp;quot;Director's Edition&amp;quot; has higher resolution CG images and a bonus disc with dramatic tracks and vocal material.</resource>

You returned to your hometown from Tokyo for the summer, and you end up sharing a place with Yuka during the holidays.

As a result, the Japanese government forms &amp;quot;JESAS&amp;quot;, a military organization with the evil intentions of controlling the future of Japan.

    <resource id="facc5d0f9fe741ac176e9d460e615933cde30fd8" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Rush Rush Rally Racing didn't receive many reviews due to the title's release on the Sega Dreamcast, which at the time of the game's release had been out of production for eight years. BeefJack gave the game a score of 8.8 out of 10, citing the focus on difficult gameplay which required multiple playthroughs, and high level of presentation for not only an indie game but a Dreamcast game in general, as highlights: &amp;quot;a steep learning curve that works in favour of the title. As you master these levels and progress through the challenge is constantly with you, always keeping the gameplay fresh and intense...Because of this races always remain highly enjoyable as even after repeated plays things here never become stale. It's certainly a system that requires you give a little to get the most out of it, but it's ultimately very rewarding&amp;quot;.</resource>

There are more options, more tactical choices and a slight graphical facelift, the base game hasn't changed dramatically.</resource>

Most of the game is spent exploring the theater, to which your military base is disguised. Depending on your decisions - where to go, which girl to look for, how to answer the questions (there is a time limit for responses) - you'll develop different relationships with the girl, which will influence not only further dialogues and the ending, but also their parameters in battles. During combat, you navigate your hero and the girls over the field and attack the enemies physically, or charge for powerful special attacks. Each turn you can perform two different actions, and your walking distance, as well as attack range, is limited and unique to each character. There is no experience points system and also no equipment.</resource>

The game is divided into adventure and battle modes. In adventure mode, you control Oogami Ichirou, moving around the theater (to which your base is disguised), trying to initiate conversations with the girls and choosing timed responses, which influence your relationship with the girl and also her parameters in combat. Battles are pre-set and take place on large isometric fields, on which you navigate your mech-piloting girls and Oogami Ichirou himself, fighting enemy forces in turn-based combat. There are two new characters in the game, and several refinements to the timed answer system.</resource>

Game play is based around a special maracas controller that you use to interact with the music.  The controller senses which region in space out of a possible 6 that the maracas are in.  It also senses when the player shakes the maracas.  As the music plays, the player must shake the maracas in the appropriate region with proper timing to progress.  A standard controller can also be used if you do not have the maracas controller, which is sold separately.

The music in the game comes from a wide variety of sources.  Some of the songs are traditional samba music, while others are recognizable pop tunes, like &amp;quot;Macarena&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Tequila.&amp;quot;</resource>

The music in Samba de Amigo is made of primarily popular Latin music songs rather than common or traditional samba. The game also features non-Latin pop songs.</resource>

The same rules apply though, get to the finish before everyone else while avoiding massive crashes and taking as many shortcuts as possible.

Along with the usual race style, you now have the ability to fly, allowing you even more speed, stunts and shortcuts to the finish line. While the tracks themselves include moving ramps and switches to other shortcuts.

Modes include time trials, stunt mode including unique track designs to get the most out of your stunts, and a four player 'Battlematch' mode that adds weapons to the action.</resource>

The cruiser Agano was on patrol when it was attacked and stricken by a confederacy of space pirates that had established a base on SATAZIUS. They attacked the Agano intending to steal the assault ship 'Trafalgar' that was stowed aboard the Agano, but the Trafalgar made a successful emergency escape.
The crew of the Trafalgar calculated the probability of successfully escaping the pirate overrun planet at 0.02%; the probability of charging into and successfully destroying the pirate base was 1%.
Taking the higher probability escape plan, the crew of the Trafalgar turned their ship and charge the pirates.</resource>

The documentary style extends to the additional content on the disc that gives you images and videos of modern day trips to the city ruins.</resource>

The player takes the role of John Mullins, a US mercenary working for an organization known as &amp;quot;The Shop&amp;quot;. The goal is simple: hunt the villains across the globe, thwart their evil plans, and save the world!

Like most 3D shooters, Soldier of Fortune consists mainly of exploring the environments and killing the enemies that try to impede the player's progress. It is one of the first shooters to isolate over 20 different body regions and show/inflict damage to those regions. For example, if the player character shoots an enemy in the foot, the enemy will limp. The game was also notable for including realistic gore animations resulting from the injuries sustained by the enemies.</resource>

Each character has a group of cards with a number on each. On every turn the player chooses a card to determine how many steps to take. When all of the cards have been used the deck is reshuffled, and each player gets a new hand. While a player can see only the numbers on their own cards, and not the numbers on other players' cards, they can still choose the cards of another player.

Each board has certain tiles: blue adds 3 rings to your total; red removes 3 rings from your total and special tiles which places all of the players into a min-game or event.

The aim of the game, at the end of it all, is to get the Precioustone (1 per board).</resource>

Once again you must take control of a party of 4 player-created adventurers and lead them through 10 scenarios from the original game and 5 new ones specially designed for this version in a side-scrolling fashion, each featuring a unique stand-alone quest for you to complete.

The remake features for the first time in a Sorcerian game a fully polygonal engine, even if the game plays like a side-scroller while in the dungeons and from a top-down perspective in the town. Also included are new items, spells and job classes for your characters and the ability to enchant items and create your own spells while in town.

Your main weapons are your fists, but you can pull out weapons for quick kills. You only get so many shots with your weapon before it breaks, though.

Gameplay is basic 3D brawling. You will be attacked by one or more enemies, and will need to defend yourself, and attack back. The game features arcade and adventure modes. In the arcade mode, the levels are timed, and you only get 5 lives but you are revived where you died. In adventure mode, you get unlimited retries of each level, but must complete each level on a single life.

Note that your objective in each level is to kill every enemy; since the levels have multiple paths, you will need to backtrack often.</resource>

A sequel to Soul Blade, Soul Calibur takes place in a time inspired by a mixture of 16th-century ancient China and oriental medieval fantasies and legends.  

All characters have weapons and distinct fighting styles with over 100 individual moves per character.  In addition to high, mid, and low attacks, characters can hold/throw, block, and perform special attacks -- one or more of which is deemed &amp;quot;un-blockable&amp;quot; and must be avoided by ducking, jumping, or rotating around your attacker. 

In addition to several locales in which to fight and alternate models/costumes per character, the Dreamcast conversion of Soul Calibur contains many additional features over the arcade coin-op, including hidden characters and locales, a campaign mode, and tournament mode.  There is also a &amp;quot;museum&amp;quot; where you can view character profiles and view motion-captured martial arts demonstrations.</resource>

The idea is you choose your favourite South Park kid (Kyle, Kenny, Stan or Cartman) and answer the questions based on episodes from the cartoon series. If you get it right, you then spin the wheel, and you either get the cash, lose it all, or play a mini game (either by yourself, against the AI, or against your friends if you're in multiplayer mode). The person who has the highest score (or the most correct answers) after a chosen amount of rounds wins.

Several lunar cycles have passed since Ulala saved human kind and repelled the Morolian invasion against Earth through dance. Life is quiet too quiet for Ulala until Chief Director 'Space Michael' reports that a mysterious dancing group is forcing innocent bystanders to dance and then whisking them awayâ€¦Here starts another swinging report show from Ulala!

Our intergalactic anchor girl must also must take part in 'Rhythm Battles', where she takes control of a musical instrument and plays in time with her opponent and 'Lyrics Battle', where Ulala gives her singing voice a workout in order to defeat the foes that await her.

A TV channel is only as good as it's last ratings and the same is true of Space Channel 5. Ulala must keep the viewer rating high, failure to do so will lead to the show being cancelled and the plug being pulled on Space Channel 5 - Space Michael is counting on you!</resource>

Take control of one of the 1930s cars and race it out around tracks, many of which are no longer available for professional competitive racing.

Whilst being a nice attempt to add some sparkle to a tired genre, many aspects of the game feel either wrong or awkward. Yes, the steering wasn't as nice on the old cars, but in simulating this the gameplay has become much harder. And why do all the cars shine as if made of polished chrome? A good attempt, but not one that rose to the surface of the day's gaming titles.</resource>

The cars are divided in three categories: Wild-Wheels, Speed Demons and Aeroblaster, each with it's unique driving feel. The cars can be tuned up with many different tuning parts, like better batteries, tires, suspension etc. - a total of 1000 different combinations.

You race on 24 original, colorful tracks with tons of bridges, ramps and loopings. You can perform absolutely breathtaking stunts on these tracks, but you need to be careful about the battery - if the car runs out of power, the race is probably over very soon.

Of course, it's possible to play multiplayer. No network support is included, so multiplayer gaming stages on one PC in split screen mode.</resource>

The game has some resemblance to the Crash Bandicoot series in that some levels have you running toward the camera, have a side-view, or have you riding an animal.  It contains some running, jumping and switch-flipping much like any 3D platformer.  However, it does have a unique magnetism aspect.  Positive and Negative charges are represented by red and blue.  Neo's head can act as a positive or negative pole.  This is called his magnogimmick.  Using the principle of opposites charges attract and similar charges repel, Neo can pull himself toward platforms, then launch off them, or navigate many related environmental puzzles such as pulling himself into teleporters or swinging on magnetic pendulums.</resource>

1. 2 new gameplay modes Y and Z, which are variations of the rules in mode X
2. An expert difficulty level
3. A Counter Gem editor which allows you to create custom attack patterns
4. EX Options where you can edit the game play rules
5. An online Vs mode

In Y and Z modes each diamond piece is a specific color, unlike mode X where a diamond embodies all colors. 

In mode Y you fill a meter by placing gems of the same color together and destroying them with a crash gem of the same color. When your meter is full you can summon a diamond whose color is determined by the character you selected. The diamond has different effects depending on what kind of gem it is placed on.

In mode Z diamonds will destroy all normal and numbered gems of the same color.

The servers for the online Vs mode of the game shutdown on September 1, 2003.</resource>

As in most aquatic racers, success here depends on your ability to smoothly handle unpredictable waves and aggressive competition at the same time.

There are several game modes to choose from.  First up is the Championship.  In this mode, you compete in a series of circuit races and accumulate points based on your finishing position.  The racer with the most points at the end of the season wins.  The other modes include a trick competition, a hazard and obstacle course, and a head-to-head 2-player mode.

As it is a Japanese game, it will therefore be necessary to adapt to driving on the left; which is not obvious at first glance, but with a little practice, we get used to it.
Obviously, you have to pay attention to all signs and respect the highway code.
To score well, it goes without saying that you have to arrive more or less on time at each stop without exceeding the speed limits (under penalty of penalty points). You will also need to ensure the comfort of passengers.
You will also need to open and close the bus doors at each stop as well as announce the next station.
Be careful, Tokyo Bus Guide is not a &amp;quot;crazy taxi&amp;quot; type arcade game, if you are in a rush and make too many infractions and mistakes; it will be a game over for sure.</resource>

Released in 1999 as one of the console's launch titles, the game was one of the first mission-based racing games. The gameplay involves the player challenging other drivers on the Shuto Expressway in order to gain money to modify and enhance his or her car. The game features a wide variety of Japanese cars and tuning parts to purchase as the player progresses through rivals.

When released in Japan, ShutokÅ Battle was one of the best selling Dreamcast titles at this time. The game is based on illegal highway racing in Tokyo's Wangan highway with custom tuned cars. A such phenomenon is growing popular in Japan since the 90's with its dedicated manga (ShutokÅ Battle's biggest inspiration being Wangan Midnight), anime series and video games (C1 Circuit, Wangan Trial, Naniwa Wangan Battle).</resource>

Last Revelation's redesigned inventory system gives Tomb Raider brand-new gameplay. Combined with Lara's new moves and abilities, gameplay features greater scope than ever before. Clear objectives and smaller locations result in less time spent traveling between areas. Individual environments are more reminiscent of the original game - tightly focused and puzzle-orientated, but with higher levels of detail and a greater number of objects than seen before. An emphasis on ancient locations and tombs allows mystery, suspense and characteristic atmosphere to play key roles throughout.</resource>

Her close friends begin to recollect her previous adventures, which occurred during different periods of her life. These include searching for the Philosopher's Stone in Rome; preventing the Spear of Destiny from falling into the hands of a ruthless gang leader; facing monsters on the Black Isle of Ireland as a child; and, finally, infiltrating a high-tech complex in pursuit of the Iris artefact. Like its predecessors, Tomb Raider: Chronicles is an action game with puzzle-solving and platforming elements. The gameplay is very similar to that of the previous games, with the addition of a few new skills. Lara can now walk on tightropes, swing on horizontal bars, and somersault forwards from a ledge while crouching. A grappling hook has been added to her inventory. The game also includes a level editor, allowing the player to create new stages for Lara to explore.</resource>

Published by Activision in 1999, it is the first entry in the Tony Hawk's series of video games. Development began after Tony Hawk's debut stint at the 1998 X-Games.

Pro Skater was originally released for the PlayStation on August 31, 1999, and was later ported to the Nintendo 64, Dreamcast, and N-Gage. It also received a Game Boy Color adaptation, and was released for Xbox in 2001 as part of the Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2x collection. The game was met with critical acclaim from critics, who praised it for its innovative gameplay, level designs and control scheme. It was also commercially successful, selling rapidly upon its opening month. The game resulted in a successful franchise that has continued to be active, with the tenth installment and latest release, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5 released in October 2015.</resource>

Using polygonal graphics, but retaining a completely 2D gameplay, Trizeal puts you in command of two tiny starfighter as you attempt to clear several stages filled with enemy ships and creatures gunning for you.

Your ship is able to morph into three distinct configurations, each with their own speed and armor as well as unique weapon system (basic machine gun, homing missiles and laser), by picking up power-ups you can upgrade each form and increase its abilities and the point of the game is to keep your ship balanced enough to survive in all situations.

Features a unique Bonus mode with additional stages not included in the arcade original, and 2-player cooperative gameplay.</resource>

Every morning before school, he is awakened by his childhood friend, Honami Fujieda, who keeps telling him that he is not a child anymore, but still comes to wake him up. These usual, ordinary days seem to stretch on forever, until one day up on the school's rooftop, while Naoki is taking a peaceful nap, out of nowhere, a girl falls out of the sky. This girl, called Mikoto Amagasaki, comes from 100 years in the future, and she went back in time with the intention of finding her brother. When Mikoto sees Naoki, she mistakes him for her brother.</resource>

The first thing you do before you even try to enter battle is decide your formations. You start with twenty soldiers, called &amp;quot;Bingos&amp;quot;, and you can place them on your 10x10 grid in small formations called boards (kind of like your different ships in Battleship, but more varied in shape). As you win battles, you'll gradually be given more Bingos (Bingoes?) to play with, and you'll earn currency that can be spent on buying more boards, in bigger sizes and a wider variety of shapes. The importance of the boards you pick and wherre you place them will become apparent when you actually get into battle</resource>

Instead of guns, your characters have keyboards strapped to them, and instead of shooting the zombies that constantly jump out at you you'll need to type out the words attached to the zombies in order to kill them before they crack open your head and feast upon the goo inside. The game ranks you on your typing speed and provides various tutorials and other edu-tainment sundries.

Otherwise it's pretty much the same game as House of the Dead 2. Much like the Resident Evil series, the zombie hordes have gone from infesting a vaguely gothic creepy old mansion to infesting a vaguely gothic decaying city, and its your job to stop them and save the human race (as usual).</resource>

What makes the game (and the real-life counterpart) distinct from wrestling, boxing, and other fights is the variety of fighting styles in use; it is perfectly possible to end up with a judo master facing a kickboxer.
The actual gameplay is simple enough. You have various basic moves, combos, holds, and so on. The complications come in the form of the huge list of moves, featuring many different styles. Hit your opponent until he gets knocked out, or force him to tap out early.
There are multiple game modes included. Among them are a survival mode, that has you face a string of enemies with minimal recovery, and career mode, which allows you to customize and improve your fighting style as you win fights.</resource>

The game is set in an alternative universe's World War II, where the players pilot the newest machines of war - prototype helicopters. While the gameplay is fairly typical for a vertical shooters, Under Defeat innovates by allowing players to tilt their vehicles slightly left and right, changing the angle of their fire.
The game was available in two different editions - a regular version, and a collector's edition pack that included a soundtrack CD. Unlike most Dreamcast games which traditionally shipped in a jewel case, both versions of Under Defeat came in a DVD-sized keep case.</resource>

You are cast in the role of a young woman named Kei, a police officer who specializes in counter-terrorist activities. One day she and her boyfriend (also a policeman) receive an assignment to investigate a murder that occurred in a hotel. The investigation gradually leads to a confrontation with a mysterious evil man who seems to know a lot about Kei's past, which was concealed from her...

The game is a third-person shooter with strong elements of survival horror, somewhat similar to  Fear Effect games. Kei uses guns in order to dispatch of the enemies. She can side-step and roll to avoid the enemies' attacks. Ammunition and health kits are rare, and there is a possibility to steal them from the enemies. Kei can communicate with the police station by using her cat, which is a disguised communication device.

Is this down to urban frustrations, or a sinister cult controlling everybody? You are either cop D'Arcy Stern or former soldier Roper McIntyre, and have to find the answers, but more importantly put a stop to the carnage. 

This involves a succession of action-packed non-linear missions. The environment incorporates shadows, rain, fog and a day/night cycle. Police cars, motorcycles and ambulances must be controlled during some missions. There are many ways to 'settle' the enemies - car chases, hand-to-hand combats and action movie-style shoot outs for example.</resource>

It uses the CPS-2 system (the same as Street Fighter Alpha series, which makes gameplay of these two titles very similar).

Vampire Chronicle is, in fact, a collection of all 18 characters and 4 different play modes available in the whole Vampire (Darkstalkers) series.
The originality of this game lies on the possibility of controlling monsters and supernatural creatures, such as vampires, werewolves, demons, zombies and mummies, instead of regular boxers or kung-fu and karate fighters.</resource>

The main difference between Vanishing Point and countless other racers is that you are never racing directly against other cars, but rather are racing against the clock.  Your position at the end of the race depends solely on your time, not on your finishing position relative to other cars. What's more, there are loads of computer controlled cars that are there simply to slow you down.

The standard racing game modes are here:  Tournament, Time Trial, and Single Race.  One unique feature, however, is the stunt competition.  You can compete in a series of events that test various driving skills in timed events.  Some example events are the long jump and the slalom.

The selection of cars is quite diverse.  You can race vehicles that range from low performance, like a VW Microbus, to high performance, like a Dodge Viper.</resource>

The game features seven events in which you must demonstrate that you are the best. The 100-meter dash, long jump, shot put, high jump, 110-meter hurdles, javelin throw, and 1500-meter run are all that stand between you and gold medal glory.

There is a choice of 10 athletes to compete with however a character editor is available to personalise the name, face and clothing of your chosen competitor. 
Virtua Athlete 2K also supports simultaneous four-player participation and a now defunct on-line internet leader board.</resource>

You are a police officer sent after criminals, from subways and a bank to aboard helicopters. The game moves you automatically, although you can find hiding places to shoot from a safe angle. Your main task is to aim and fire your weapon so as to take out the bad guys for points. Avoid the innocents, as shooting them costs you points. The enemies have tougher firepower than in the original.</resource>

The &amp;quot;tb&amp;quot; adds a team battle mode which was not present in the coin-op. For those that do not know, the Virtua Fighter series is your classic beat-em-up, with a bunch of characters all trying to kick, punch, throw and body slam the bejesus out of each other. Each of the characters has over a hundred possible moves and the game plays very faithfully to the original. The game features interesting arena to fight in which are more like real locations in they are not flat and some parts can be broken away during the match.

The games graphics have been improved, and there is a greater roster of players to choose from. The most noteworthy addition is that of female players, such as Monica Seles and Venus and Serena Williams. You cannot however play as a male against a female.
The gameplay is a lot faster than the original. The players you control move a lot faster, as do the AI computer players. Less diving, but more getting at shots that go behind you and over the shoulder shots.

The game modes from the original are the same, featuring tournament mode, where you play against the pros; exhibition mode for a one-on-one, best-out-of-three game; and world tour mode which now features the option of creating and customizing your own player. Build you player up, buy equipment and hire pros to play in doubles matches with you.</resource>

As you go along, rain starts to fall onto the arena, so you better keep the walls as high as possible. Too much on the screen, though, will start and earthquake. Ice blocks fall to freeze the water. Bombs drop, leaving holes in your walls and fireballs dry up the water. Simply go as long as possible to get as high a score as you can. There is a practice mode available, and you can play against a friend.</resource>

There are 3 organizations to join, a bit of fighting, but generally this is all pretty calm and involves `` living '' your character's life.</resource>

You can play an exhibition game or a season of 13-162 games, including an All-Star game and play-offs.

Gameplay is the standard behind-the-catcher viewpoint for batting and pitching, switching to different views after the ball is hit.  The famous limitation of World Series Baseball 2K1 is that you cannot control the fielders until after the ball is fielded!  For this reason the game was almost universally panned by reviewers upon its release.  This flaw was fixed in subsequent releases of the World Series Baseball franchise.</resource>

For those who've never played Worms, it's at heart similar to the old game Artillery, which you control an artillery piece. In essence, you give it a shot angle and shot power, and try to hit your enemy, despite wind effects and the enemy firing back at you. Worms puts you in command of a team of Worms, but not only can you move around the landscape, you can use many types of weapons to try to dispatch the enemy, from bazookas to mini-guns to exploding sheep. 

Everything is presented in a humorous cartoonish style, from the landscapes to the worms themselves and their cries of triumph or despair, depending on how you do.

Armageddon uses an enhanced version of the Worms 2 engine, and while an improvement over Worms 2, it's not a huge change.</resource>

You're going to learn that there's nothing more dangerous than a Worm with a bazooka or a shotgun...

At first sight, Worms World Party may seem very similar to Worms Armageddon. However, this time the game has been specially designed with multiplayer in mind. Up to 6 players can battle out at the same time on local networks or on the internet, using Team17 own matchmaking service, called Wormnet.

Other welcomed additions are the Wormpot, which can provide 400 gameplay variations from &amp;quot;Goliath Mode&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;Bleeding Worms&amp;quot;, hundreds of new landscapes, flags and fanfares, and a load of single player missions.</resource>
