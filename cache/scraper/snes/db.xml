    <resource id="c66928345963461afdd3383dcb56aa965a3b0d2f" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">The game has some similarities with Hat Trick Hero, Aoki Densetsu Shoot! or any other soccer game with the left-right perspective, and Top Striker or Libero Grande because of the ability to play as just one player, instead of controlling the whole team. This feature would serve as a model for the &amp;quot;career mode&amp;quot; provided in most modern EA Sports games.[citation needed] There were many other improvements over the two original versions. One of the most important being the availability of creating and customizing an own character/football player and training with the instructor before each match, among other options. Coaches give out verbal reports that range between &amp;quot;perfect&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;needs improvement.</resource>

There is no longer conventional professional baseball in 2020. Baseball designed by the Super Baseball Association has been very popular and is the best sport.

However, the truth is that the association has used a colossal sum of money to promote Super Baseball as show business. They have manipulated each player's ability using the control computer to secretly decide victory or defeat in every game. The players who knew this removed the connecting parts of the computer to play their own game of baseball. Finally, a fair game is going to be played at Cyber Egg Stadium.

In 2020 Super Baseball is a fast-paced game with new rules, where you can select 1 of 12 individual men, women, or robot players. During play, you can make your team stronger with prizes earned from amazing catches.</resource>

League) to play with. In the European version they were replaced by national teams, but the some playing modes are still reminiscent of the origin. The available modes are exhibition matches, tournament, league, cup and all-star (the teams are divided into two leagues and the overall winner is decided with play-offs). With the option &amp;quot;You're a Hero&amp;quot;, the player can create a new athlete, change his stats with a few training lessons and swap it with an existing one. The player either controls the athlete who has the ball or, when in defense, the one who is nearest to it. The field is shown from a slightly angled side-perspective. During most modes, all teams can be taken over by human players, but only two can play at the same time.</resource>

Now, without warning, a mechanical moon has appeared in the skies over Mars, and is raining down destruction on the colonies. A plan is hastily put into action to destroy the moon and its armada of space-craft. Due to the impossible task of surviving a direct assault, the mission is code-named Acrobat Mission.

Your spaceship is capable of firing a single straight ahead shot. By picking up a Wide upgrade, more shots are added that fly off at an angle, and the shot can be charged up to unleash a continuous short range cone of energy. Picking up a Hurricane upgrade will cause bullets to circle you defensively before shooting forward, and charging will store a full round of bullets up to be fired straight ahead all at once. Up to two bombs can be held at once, and if an enemy bullet hits a bomb it will detonate, saving your ship from damage. If your ship is hit, however, then you will have a few seconds to ram it into whatever shot you and take them down with you. Unlike most scrolling shooter games contact with an enemy ship will not kill you, but they can still push you into the path of bullets.</resource>

You play &amp;quot;The Master&amp;quot;, and must save the world from evil. First you purge the land by sending your spirit into a warrior with a big sword and magic powers. This side scrolling portion puts you in many different locales, from swamps and forests, to pyramids and snowy mountaintops. As you eliminate evil from different parts of the land, you allow villagers to return and build their towns. You then control an angel who helps guide the villagers in their town building, and can send down miracles to aid them in their needs.</resource>

You control Fester, by moving him around, fighting regular enemies and bosses, talking to members of Addams household, and occasionally solving puzzles. The combat is pure action,  Zelda-style.</resource>

The game takes place towards the end of the movie: the Addams Family has been evicted from their home by a court order issued by a backstabbing attorney (there's one for the books), Tully Alford. Even worse, the other Addamses: Morticia, Pugsley, Wednesday, Granny and Lurch have gone missing.

As Gomez, you must tour the Addams mansion in search of your lost family, battling out mysterious monsters and evading traps, and eventually face your nemesis, Tully.</resource>

The player takes the role of Pugsley who gets challenged to a scavenger hunt by his sister Wednesday.  He has to retrieve six items which are of course hidden in six levels which can be accessed in any order. The gameplay follows the usual platforming standards: Pugsley moves from left to right while jumping a lot, avoiding enemies and sometimes solving switch puzzles. Pugsley can take three hits before dying but if he collects enough dollar symbols he can replenish his health.

Each level sends Batman against one particular villain. Most levels present Batman with a large number of henchmen to take out and environmental dangers to avoid on his way to one or more boss battles. Besides kicks, throws and punches, Batman can use a variety of equipment against the enemies. Always available are Batarangs and the grappling hook. Before each mission, Batman can also select additional equipment, like knockout gas spray, throwing stars, smoke bombs and plastic explosives, all with limited ammunition. Special equipment required for certain levels include a flashlight, gas mask and X-ray goggles. If some necessary equipment is missing, it is always possible to return to the Batcave to change the gear and then restart the current level. Many of the situations and environments of the levels are based on episodes from the series and the game's graphics emulate the animation and drawing style of the show.</resource>

The game plays out much like an episode of the show.  The story begins at the dedication of the Frostbite Falls Rocky and Bullwinkle museum.  Unfortunately, the not-so-nice Boris and Natasha have disguised themselves as security guards for the museum and managed to steal some of the priceless artifacts.

Bullwinkle and Rocky must track down the stolen artifacts and return order to Frostbite Falls.  Most of the action is of the side-scrolling platformer variety, but along the way, you will get to play lots of mini-games involving characters from the show. During the platforming sections you can switch instantly between the two protagonists. Both play differently: Bullwinkle can throw bombs at enemies and Rocky can fly for short instances.

Some strategic decisions you must make include negotiating for open air routes, purchasing or selling aircraft, invest in branch offices and hotels, advertise your airline and set budgets. You must also pay attention to statistics like quarterly and annual sales reports, as well as city data. World events also affect your airline, from natural disasters to war and even the Olympic games, all of which will affect how many passengers you get.

The player begins by racing go-karts, then moves up to snow mobiles, then IROC racing cars, and then finally Indy racing cars. If the player places high enough in all the races, then the final challenge is to take on Al Unser, Jr. in the finals in Vancouver.

The story is told in cut-scenes between battles and traveling within towns. World map and dungeons are handled as huge battlefields, where your party moves in turn-based style, waiting for the enemy turn until you can perform your next action. Enemies often come in large groups, and strategic positioning of your party members on the battle field plays an important role. The town of Gouto hosted a miraculous artifact, the Key of Resurrection. The evil wizard Oswald invaded the town with his army of goblins and dragons. Three brave knights went out to defend the homeland, and one of them was killed in battle. His wife and his daughter Sophia left the house crying, but Oswald was already in the town, and with one strike he killed Sophia's mother. Ten years later, in a nearby town lives a young brave warrior named Albert. He just turned sixteen, and he undergoes an initiation as a descendant of brave heroes of the past. Meanwhile, Sophia became the court wizard of the kingdom. She hasn't forgot the murder of her parents, but she needs the help of a brave warrior like Albert to avenge their death and to stop Oswald.</resource>

You wander around slaying enemies in real time combat, gathering treasure on the way, and occasionally participating in boss battles. When you gather enough experience from fighting, you gain extra hit points. You can also upgrade your weapons. On the way you'll meet some characters who will join your party for short time, and you'll be able to use their special attacks and magic. Past and future are connected in a way mortals do not understand. A star was glowing up in the sky, and the demon god Alcahest appeared, bringing chaos and destruction to the world. A single swordsman stood in defiance. The four powers that protect the world, the Guardians, gave him their power, and with it the swordsman slew the demon and restored peace in the world. Thousand years have passed. And a new battle is already on the way. A cruel emperor leads his troops towards conquest. The kingdom of Panakeia is defending itself with the aid of its knights. Once again, the ominous star shines in the sky, indicating the demon's revival. With the help of Alcahest's power, the evil emperor wants to conquer the world. But the new generation also brings the new hero - the brave swordsman Alen. Aided by the Guardians, Alen must stop the Empire's evil plans and to destroy Alcahest once again.</resource>

Alfred cannot fly, but he can use ramps to jump up and hit enemies with his bionic beak - this kills them, but any other contact will hurt Alfred. Watch out for spiked snails though. Other enemies include whales armed with guns, and stray bombs.</resource>

It looks pretty great as a video game ? just a sort of four-player pinball thing, like a pinball version of Warlords or something.

It?s based on a real Crossfire-esque board game ? which I?d never heard of, but looks completely badass. I assumed the board game never came out in Japan, hence the ?American? in the Super Famicom title, but nope: the board game was released with the same title, with a cute little face on the top!</resource>

Gameplay features smashes, passing shots, volleys and all kinds of backhand and forehand plays, but unlike other games, precise positioning and timing are crucial to avoid hitting the ball outside the court, swinging the racket into thin air or more embarrassing, let the ball hit you on the head. Three courts are available. Game modes change according to the version, with the 16-bit versions including a &amp;quot;Skins&amp;quot; game, where each point is worth a sum of money based on the number of times the ball was hit.</resource>

But with time, the queen's power fades, and a new queen must replace her. Several candidates compete until one of them proves that she has the knowledge of the nine elements and has convinced the Guardians to lend their power to her. The heroine of the game is a seventeen-year-old Angelique Limoges, and her main adversary is a rather unpleasant girl named Rosalia. Will Angelique be able to befriend the Guardians and become the next queen? Angelique borrows elements from different genres: Japanese-style adventure (without puzzles), &amp;quot;dating sim&amp;quot;, and (not overly complex) strategy. The goal is to make sure that Angelique has good relationship with the Guardians, maintaining the balance. For that, Angelique has to visit them daily, talk to them, and see what effects their powers have over the land.</resource>

Now he must fight for his life, first with his bare hands, then with a gun he finds. But what gives him courage is that he is not alone. One of the aliens, who together with him escapes from the prison, helps him on his dangerous quest. Friendship can overcome all the obstacles.

Out of This World is an action adventure game, where the adventuring element is concealed behind what looks like a typical platform shooter. The gameplay is based mainly on physical and environmental puzzles. There is no on-screen interface, and no in-game dialogue. Each enemy requires a different strategy, and often there is only one way to solve the problem. Typically, enemies will be defeated through the use of a gun you find near the beginning of the game; the gun can be used to create a shield from behind which you can safely fire. 

The game is divided into levels, each one of which can be accessed by typing a code you learn after having completed the level. If you die (which is often) you restart the level anew. The game features vector graphics and animated cut scenes.

The game has an exhibition mode, an anime-style story mode, and a variety of options, which is entirely in Japanese, so literacy in this language is strongly recommended for quality gameplay. Once the game begins, the action progresses in a side view, similar to an arcade soccer game.</resource>

Duenan and Bri join the Olympus' police, a force that seems hardly necessary in such a paradise. But, like in most pretty pictures, perfection is an illusion, and Olympus' peaceful facade hides a dark secret, a violent struggle between human and cyborg that could once again plunge the world into war... and genocide.</resource>

The game, originally written for the 8-bit Ataris, is basically a Defender clone, but popular because it so closely recreates the gameplay of the original Defender, with its speedy scrolling and frantic gameplay.

The player is a spaceman with a jet-pack, flying across a barren landscape whose skies are inhabited by a number of different aliens; from the simple Planter to the slowly advancing Blunder Storm or the quick, aggressive Nemesite. 

Planters and Nemesites will try to pickup the small men walking on the surface, who must then be rescued. You must shoot down the alien, while avoiding to hit the man. Sometimes, the aliens will carry an android, which is similar to the human but deadly. Care must be taken so as to not pick up the androids. All men must be transported to a surface base, where they are put in safety. This is the Dropzone.

This is a  Gauntlet-like game: lots of action and magic, with items to collects, and many dungeons to free from monsters. The game is also viewed from an isometric perspective, typical for the genre. Choose one of four characters to battle your way through dungeons and castles, or play with a friend in a 2-player mode.</resource>

His minions stormed the castle and burnt it down. The king could not escape his fate, and the villain thought no one was spared by his wrath. You are Ariel, a little girl who lives with her old wise grandmother in a small house near a mountain range, north to the forest. She just turned ten, and the grandmother sends her on a seemingly simple quest: to go through the forest to Nineveh, the nearby town, and to meet there a certain person. But what starts as a simple assignment soon develops into the quest for magic powers of Aretha, the ultimate battle against the evil, and the discovery of Ariel's own true identity. The game is a console-style RPG, where Ariel and her party travel on the world map, through forests, mountain paths, and caves, occasionally visiting towns and fighting monsters in turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective, using a variety of physical and special attacks.</resource>

After she rightfully regained her throne, people enjoyed a peaceful life under her benevolent reign. But this peaceful existence did not last long... Two adventurers who were wandering through mountains met a mysterious evil being, who threatened to ruin Ariel's kingdom. After that, the two men disappeared without a trace. Ariel's servants reported to her about the matter. After consulting her wise grandmother, Ariel decided to go out herself, to meet up with her old trusty companions and to find out the origin of the new threat.

The game is a console-style RPG - you fight random enemies in turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective. Enemies may attack you from the sides, and you should pay attention which enemy you face. A unique feature the game uses is the ability to get special items called &amp;quot;souls&amp;quot; after battles, and then to use them to forge your own armor.

Her big brother Ryo Sakazaki and Robert Garcia, his best friend, go search for her on the streets of South Town. As they go deeper and deeper they will find clues as to who ordered the kidnapping, the Sakazaki family's relation to the mob, and a person from their past.

This fighting game is a coin-op conversion of the Neo-Geo hit of the same name, and has all characters, stages, and moves featured in the arcade unit. Unlike the original arcade version, players can now play as Mr. Big and the elusive Mr. Karate.

The gameplay differs from most fighting games. In this game, you have a Spirit meter. A Spirit meter is in the game and will decrease as you perform special moves. It can be recharged, but doing so leaves you open to attack. When your health is almost gone, you can perform a secret combination that will unleash a deadly attack on your opponent - provided you have a full Spirit meter.</resource>

It is a spiritual sequel to Altron's Olivia's Mystery, released earlier the same year. Like that game, Aryol features an ongoing story that is occasionally interrupted with a jigsaw puzzle the player must solve to continue the plot. The puzzle that the player must construct is constantly in motion, which can help and disorient the player in equal measure. In addition, there are &amp;quot;fake&amp;quot; pieces that will cause the puzzle to break apart if added in lieu of the real pieces.The story of Aryol involves a mysterious green-clad thief and his female partner, who is dressed in a French policeman's outfit, as they attempt to rob banks to pay for her flying career. The plot heavily features an airship known as the Aryol, which lends its name to the game. </resource>

Shogi means general's (sho) board game (gi).

The earliest predecessor of the game, chaturanga, originated in India in the 6th century, and sometime in the 10th to 12th centuries xiangqi (Chinese chess) was brought to Japan where it spawned a number of variants. Shogi in its present form was played as early as the 16th century, while a direct ancestor without the &amp;quot;drop rule&amp;quot; was recorded from 1210 in a historical document Nichureki, which is an edited copy of Shochureki and Kaichureki from the late Heian period</resource>

Joe Yabuki, the protagonist of this story, is an everyday man who was orphaned at at a young age. With no hope for the future, Joe becomes a delinquent with no direction in life. While walking around the slums of Tokyo, Joe helps a kid who is being bullied by a gangster. By fate, a down and out boxing trainer named Danpei Tange sees the fight between Joe and the gangster. Danpei believes Joe has what it takes to be a professional boxer. With the help of Danpei and others, Joe will achieve growth not only as a boxer, but as a human being as well.
The game consists of 8 opponents which Joe must defeat in succession to move on. Each one must be knocked out in the first round or Joe must begin the fight again if any continues are left (You get 3 continues regardless of difficulty setting). The characters Joe fights all come from the manga so they should be familiar to Tomorrow?s Joe fans. Most involve using a certain strategy to defeat them and herein lies the challenge and fun.</resource>

Developed by Beam Software, the same company responsible for Radical Rex, Shadowrun, and Tom &amp; Jerry: Frantic Antics. It was canceled for unknown reasons.
The game is relatively unknown, having only been mentioned in media a few times in late 1993 and throughout 1994 in name only. No magazine has been known to have given the game a preview.
The goal of the game is to complete each level while avoiding the Gatekeeper's unfair rules, which occur randomly.
Bathory's Castle appears to be the least finished, as it doesn't seem like it can be completed.</resource>

The player starts off choosing an angler. Then the player can either go to the bait shop, practice pond, or start in the tournament. In the bait shop, choices of baits, lines, rods, reels, fish finders, and boat engines are available for purchase.

    <resource id="314ca341554a6d6dd176fb610c1d86876492c929" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">The game is set in the end of Edo period in Japan (1600-1868). Japan, controlled by the feudal rulers (shoguns) of the Tokugawa dynasty, consumed by a peaceful sleep for three hundred years, was awoken by the arrival of the Westerners. The gameplay is similar to Dragon Quest series and other console-style RPGs: the battles are random, turn-based, and are viewed from first-person perspective. You fight using physical attacks and a variety of special moves based on spiritual energy. An unusual addition to the gameplay is the karma system. By doing good deeds you can increase your karma level, in an Ultima-like way. This way you get more money and precious items from fighting monsters, and your special powers increase in strength. If you don't show compassion, steal people's things and lie, your karma will decrease, you won't get money from random battles, and some people will attack you.</resource>

    <resource id="a44d9fb4b7d7f05c6d994b4362798dbb23c9b1bb" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Bakutou Dodgers is a Japan-only action game for up to four players. It superficially resembles Hudson's Bomberman series, with its top-down grid stages and chaotic gameplay, but rather than leaving bombs and waiting for them to explode, the player can shoot energy at blocks and each other.

The goal is to sneak up behind the opponent and shoot them before they can reciprocate. Various power-ups may appear after destructible blocks are removed, which can give the player an edge or, in the case of the ? icon, a possible random negative effect like reversed controls. There are also wandering monsters that can cause damage to anyone they come in contact with. Every combatant has a health bar which depletes at a rate dependent on the attacks they are getting hit by.

The single-player mode involves fighting through various worlds and removing all enemy combatants from the field to progress.</resource>

The game is composed of platform levels. On each level there is a hidden scooter part, which Chester has to recover before being able to exit the level. On the way there are various creatures that will try to eliminate Chester and obstacles to watch for. Chester can dash and stun enemies by jumping on their heads.

In Iowa, at a county fair, Barbie must catch an escaped pig by walking up to it and pressing the action button, after that she can play carnival games.  The options are a strength test, knocking down cans and a hit-the clown game.  In the latter two, players can  aim balls with the d-pad, then throw with the action button.  Leading targets is required.  The strength test has a mater that goes up and down and Barbie must land her hit when the indicator is on the bell to ring it.

In Wyoming, Barbie goes camping.  First, she must assemble her tent.  This is essentially a jigsaw puzzle.  Next, she must jump from rock to rock to get to the other side of the park where she can go on a nature hike.  In the next segment, players aim a camera cursor at animals as Barbie walks along the path and hit the action button to take photos.  This requires good reaction time.

There's a ranch in Texas where Barbie can ride horses.  The horse runs on its own.  The player pushes the action button to make it jump.  There are numerous gates on the course and the player must time jumps correctly to clear them.  If they hit too many, they must start over.  There is also the option to play horseshoes.  The cursor moves about erratically and you must press the action button when it passes over the stake.

In Florida, Barbie can play volleyball against Midge.  This game allows both players to play simultaneously in two-player mode.  Barbie and Midge can move forward or backward on the court and hit action to set the ball.  First one to ten points wins.  There is also a diving segment where barbies must navigate an underwater maze to collect sunken treasure. It might remind some people of Barbie's Ocean Discovery.

Finally, there is Barbie's home in California.  Ken has hidden presents around the house and Barbie must find them and identify them by shape.

It is another entry in Hot-B's long line of fishing games. Players aim to become a professional fisherman and can travel by themselves or along with Hank.

There are four different fishing areas players advance to as they win each round of the tournament. Players travel by boat on the water, select a fishing spot and then select lure and cast fish. Certain types of fish are only available at specific spots. There is also a fish radar that makes a sound when there is fish nearby. Players need to select the correct type of lure (there are about 20), keep track of weather conditions and the limited time available in tournaments. Some fish fight back hard and need to be reeled in with careful timing.

The four tournaments are Local Amateur Tournament, Amateur Bass Championship, Pro Bass Tournament and Bassin' World Championship. About eight types of fish can be caught.

To fight whoever flies thar yonder in the distance, you send out projectiles, in our case fireballs. These behave differently depending on which of the four main buttons you press: if you press the A button, they fly in a curve towards the upper right part of the screen, if you push the Y button, they go left and down and so on and so forth. Sadly, they move so slowly your opponent has a good three seconds to get out of the way, and in so weird curves that aiming is impossible. Also, the screen constantly twists in all directions.</resource>

    <resource id="5e3626d0becdfa0f0bc5c9d6aa1ddbe5aa8a933d" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">The successful movie sequel Batman Returns spawned many different game adaptations. The SNES version presents the story of Batman's encounter with the Penguin and Catwoman as a side-scrolling beat'em'up, with one Batmobile driving sequence thrown in.

There are two varieties of the beat'em'up levels. One plays like Final Fight and similar games: Batman can move in two dimensions, beating up his enemies with various punches, kicks, combos and special moves.
Special gadgets to be used include the famous Batarang to take out enemies from a distance and &amp;quot;Test Tubes&amp;quot; filled with chemical explosives which will damage all enemies on the screen.

In the second type of side-scrolling level, Batman can only move in one dimension, left or right. The Batarang is the standard weapon here, with punches only being used when the enemy gets close. Also in these levels, Batman can use a grappling hook to cross dangerous areas unharmed.

Enemies in the beat'em'up levels usually belong to the Penguin's Red Triangle Circus Gang - clowns in all varieties: thin clowns, fat clowns, clowns on bikes, clowns armed with bazookas, and more. At the end of each level there is a boss fight, including several encounters with Catwoman and the Penguin.

In the Batmobile driving level, the action is viewed from behind. Batman has to evade clowns on bikes and shoot them down when he gets the chance. At the end of the road, another boss fight awaits.

Digitized images from the film illustrate the storyline.</resource>

Aspiring to rule the human world, a zealous demon from the Netherworld sends out five phantoms to posses each contender, so that the last survivor will be able to murder the king. However, one of the contenders, Durill manages to defeat the phantom that tries to take control of him, but dies from exhaustion. His son Kerrel takes Durill's place in the Tournament to avenge his father and kill the demon.

Battle Blaze is a one on one fighting game seen from a side-scrolling perspective. A jump and an attack button is all that is needed to control the six different characters. Each character uses a different weapon and has a few unique special attacks.

There are two modes of play: In &amp;quot;Hero&amp;quot;-mode, the player can only control of Kerrel and must follow the game's story. In &amp;quot;Battle&amp;quot;-mode, all characters are available and two-player fights are possible.</resource>

The players can pick from 40 fictional drivers and 24 teams to play with. The game is always shown in split-screen mode, even when the player is playing on his own, in this case the opponent directly behind or ahead of the player is shown in the other window. Car settings can be adjusted in the garage. Pit-stops can be used to repair the car during a race. Crashing the car can also force the player to retire from the race early.

In the game the player can choose from four game modes:

1. Survival - Finish at or lower than a certain position (determined by your difficulty) to continue to the next race
Champion
VS
Slot - In this game mode steering happens automatically. The only thing the players need to concern themselves with is the gas and break pedals.

The game features three difficulty levels: Beginner, Pro and Expert.</resource>

Falling behind or running into a hedge or jump will cause the horse to lose stamina, and losing all stamina causes it to collapse briefly. The player needs to keep a steady pace, steer carefully around corners, jump at the right times and use the boost sparingly in order to win. In the battle mode stamina is less of a concern and the game more resembles RC Pro-Am: the players have to simply follow the course and avoid the dangers as they show up.</resource>

The game contains four tables, each themed to a different hero: Kamen Rider, who fights in dusty wastelands with a number of his recurring enemies; Ultraman, who fights in a city against various kaiju; Knight Gundam, who fights in space; and Banpresto's own original character Fighter Roar, whose stage is set under the ocean. Each table also has three screens, each with their own set of paddles, and the player attempts to earn highscores from the various features on each table.</resource>

Battletoads in Battlemaniacs is another game in the Battletoads series by Rare. Much like its predecessor, it blends fighting game elements (in the style of Double Dragon) with other kinds of gameplay, like racing levels, &amp;quot;snake riding&amp;quot; levels and such. There are some bonus levels between some of the regular ones, where the player can collect extra lives.

Buddies can team up and defeat the opposition together in the two coop-modes available. In mode A, players can hit each other while in mode B, they can't.</resource>

The characters were originally from comedian Robin Harris' &amp;quot;Bébé's Kids&amp;quot; (pronounced Bay-Bay) stand-up comedy act. They're described as little hellions and bad-ass troublemaker kids.  In this game, someone has taken control of the Fun World amusement park, and you've got to help Kahlil, LaShawn, and PeeWee make things right. 

You can play as either Kahlil or LaShawn and can use each character's different special attacks. Kahlil uses a spin-tuck to take out almost any enemy you meet and LaShawn uses powerful cartwheels. Enemies such as animatronic robots and security guards must be taken out in the first time-limited level.  Some items can also be picked up and thrown at enemies.   The second level has the baby PeeWee in a china shop knocking glasses off shelves and you must break 10 before they hit you or the ground or are grabbed by your caretaker Robin.  There is also a haunted house maze level where you must keep trying different doors until you find the exit
while avoiding mummies along the way. Then there's a pirate ship beat em' up level and eventually you make your way to the underground control center and the Big Boss.</resource>

Your four puppies need to be rescued and brought back to their mom. As a responsible father and guardian you'll first need to find the puppy, avoiding dangers such as bad-tempered cats, mean dogcatchers, acorns which have a habit to drop down just when you pass underneath, and careless skateboarders. You can bark at these opponents to scare them away. And if you'll find a source of water (such as a rubber hose), you can make yourself wet and then - in a tense situation - shake off the water, eliminating everyone in the vicinity. 

Once you find your pup, you'll find out that getting him back to his mom is no easy task. While your puppy can - thankfully - walk on his own accord when you put him down, you'll still have to carry it over obstacles, and you'll be forced to fight all the enemies again while doing it.</resource>

After you choose your fighter for his parameters (strength, stamina and resistance), you can choose from 55 different moves.
You can now train your fighter at a gym before the real fights.
To master the game, one must alternate training and fights, as training improves stamina, strength and resistance.
Be careful, loosing a fight reduces those parameters, so you have to be ready before getting on the ring !

The logo, as we all know looks like a statue of a person with his hands extending towards the sky. Seeing this logo, the slugs determine that ours is a race made up of BONES and of ADVERTISING, two things the slugs simply hate. So they attack.

With the slug invasion in full swing, earth is quite simply outnumbered by the gooey slugs. It must recruit special super soldiers, Big Sky Troopers, armed with a special heavily armored suit to combat the menace. So urgent is the need for qualified Big Sky Troopers, that recruiting and rank are petty things. It is not unknown for example for a brand new trooper to start as a 21-star general in the army.

Once selected, it is up to your Big Sky Trooper, piloting a FIDO class starship, to engage the slugs in space and in planetfall and thwart their plans to destroy mythical galactic devices and conquer humanity.</resource>

    <resource id="5ddd471349f1fde06bd14cd14d91c15b60f2ac6d" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">The game is based on the popular manga/animé series of the same name. The heroine of the series is a 14-year-old schoolgirl named Serena (Usagi in the Japanese version). One day she encounters a magical talking cat named Luna, who tells her she has been chosen to be a Sailor Moon fighter, to find the lost Princess of the Moon Kingdom and to fight the forces of darkness lead by the evil Queen Beryl. 

This adaptation of the story is a beat-'em-up game. You can control either Serena herself or one of her Sailor Moon companions. Each girl has different strengths and special attacks. You advance in the game by moving on a platform and defeating the enemies you encounter. You can't move on if you haven't defeated all the enemies that keep coming at you.

    <resource id="d56d31beee222b628a1e2868bbdf98978acf91f8" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">The game is based on the Japanese manga and animé series Bishoujo Senshi: Sailor Moon - &amp;quot;Bishoujo Senshi&amp;quot; roughly meaning &amp;quot;Pretty Young Girl Warrior&amp;quot;. It is set in the 30th century, in a futuristic city Crystal Tokyo. In this city lives a totally ordinary (at first) fourteen-year old girl Usagi. When she meets a magical cat named Luna, she finds out that she is in fact a princess sent to the future in order to fight the minions of Darkness. She discovers within herself the power to transform into the hero of darkness, Sailor Moon, meets other warriors who help her on her quest, and fights the evil Queen Beryl, hostile aliens, and other foes.

The events of this game take place shortly after Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon S, the fourth volume of the long-running series. A global peace is established in the universe, but lately suspicious things are happening. A strange meteorite is seen approaching the Earth. Street gangs and spies who work for a mysterious person called Apsu are seen in Crystal Tokyo. And the Mystic Silver Crystal, the Ginzuishou, which protects the city, is shaking! Usagi and her friends must now investigate the strange events and face the forces of Darkness once again.

The game is a console-style RPG in  Final Fantasy style (battles with your party to the right and the enemies to the left), with a battle system somewhat similar to that of  Chrono Trigger: you must form a party out of several available characters, make them participate in battles together, and learn powerful combo attacks.

Peace has returned to the Moon Kingdom. But suddenly, a little girl named Chibiusa arrives from the future and says the future kingdom is threatened by the forces of the evil Prince Diamond. Looks like you are the only ones who can defeat him, and save the future Sailor Moon, Chibiusa's mother.

This is a beat-'em up game. You can play as either Usagi or any of her girlfriends, including Chibiusa. You move on a platform and fight the enemies by punching, kicking, and throwing them, and by using special abilities unique to each character. You can advance only after you have cleared an area from enemies.</resource>

Players begin by choosing from a selection of Sailor Moon licensed characters, each with a unique special attack. The player is presented with a board filled with colored blocks in three colors: red, blue and green. The goal is to remove all the blocks from play. Clicking on a block that touches several adjacent blocks of the same color will remove them all from play. As each player successfully clears blocks, they drop &amp;quot;black blocks&amp;quot; on their opponent as well as increase their power bar. Black blocks cannot be removed by normal means and disappear only when large ammounts of blocks are removed adjacent to them. As the power bar charges, players can unleash their special ability, often an attack on the other player.

This puzzle game is based on the &amp;quot;S&amp;quot; series of Sailor Moon and includes characters from there: Sailor Moon, Sailor Mars, Sailor Venus, Sailor Mercury, Sailor Jupiter, Chibiusa, Tuxedo Mask, Sailor Uranus, Sailor Neptune and Sailor Pluto.

Upon choosing a character (each with unique &amp;quot;special moves&amp;quot;), the player competes against an opponent. Each player controls a grid of 10x6 sections (represented by hearts) initially made up of clear hearts. The player moves their cursor over the clear hearts to turn them into one of four colors: red, yellow, blue and green. Sometimes &amp;quot;treasures&amp;quot; will show up on the board. When several hearts of the same color are adjacent to one another, the player can clear them... which pushes all the hearts (and treasures) down towards the bottom. The goal is to be the player with the most treasures to end the round.

Sailor Moon characters featured are primarily from the &amp;quot;S&amp;quot; Series and includes: Sailor Moon, Sailor Mars, Sailor Mercury, Sailor Venus, Sailor Jupiter, Chibius, Tuxedo Mask, Sailor Neptune, Sailor Uranus and Sailor Pluto.

The goal of the game is to fire at the balloons that appear at the top of the screen to pop them. By shooting a balloon adjacent to another of the same color, the player pops both simultaneously. By popping a large number of balloons simultaneously, they can create trash for the other player to clear - these appear as gray balloons that can't easily be popped directly but disappear when multiple balloons are popped near them.

The player can select between nine Sailor Guardians in the vs. mode (all except Saturn), but is restricted to Sailors Moon, Chibi Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter and Venus for the single-player story mode. Sailor Saturn appears in-game as an advisor, but is not playable. The game was followed by a sequel the following year: Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon Super S: Fuwa Fuwa Panic 2. It also received a fan translation in 2016.</resource>

    <resource id="94d863e71fd77f61445c7f7e9877e5d3bf091b64" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Blackthorne is an action-adventure game that takes place on the planet Tuul. Tuul was a peaceful place, until the evil warrior Sarlac used the power of the Darkstone to take control.  Blackthorne's father, the good King Vlaros, sent him to Earth just as his kingdom crumbled around him.  Now, 20 years later, Blackthorne is grown and must return to Tuul to free it from the clutches of Sarlac.

This game is played from a side-view with non-scrolling backgrounds. It has strong similarities to Prince of Persia, except you battle your foes using guns and bombs instead of a sword.</resource>

Choose one of the five allied fighter pilots to do battle against the Central Powers. The game consists of 20 missions with the final one culminating with a battle between the player and &amp;quot;The Red Baron&amp;quot;.

Missions are basically the same as in its' predecessor Wings. There are bombing missions where you have to take out targets that were circled in an aerial photograph, strafing runs where you get to blast anything that you fancy blasting with an unlimited supply of ammo, and of course the main part: dogfights in the sky.

If a mission is completed successfully, the player can power up the successful pilot in four skill categories: flying, shooting, mechanics, and stamina. A failed mission can lead to either a dishonorable discharge or death for the pilot.

Bonkers is a bob-cat police officer who lives in &amp;quot;toondom&amp;quot;, a cartoony land where people co-exist with various creatures from cartoon movies. 

One day, Bonkers and his partner Lucky hear about a shocking robbery: Hollywood's most valuable treasures - Sorcerer's Hat, Mermaid's Voice, and Magic Lamp - were stolen! Now it is up to Bonkers to capture the thieves and to take back the stolen treasures.

This is an action platform game. Bonkers can jump and dash, throwing enemies aside and even destroying some obstacles. Enemies can be killed by jumping on their heads. You can also collect various items such as bombs to throw at the enemies, cakes to refill your health, or hyper juice to make you dash continuously.

Besides the common license, this game is totally different from the Genesis game  Bonkers.

The player can interrupt the action at any time to command their units to use special moves, otherwise units will march towards enemies and attempt to cut them down with regular attacks. Players can also customize their group on the camp screen between fights, organizing their equipment and setting their AI to heal themselves once they hit a health percentage threshold.The game was followed up with two sequels for the Sony PlayStation: 1997's Bounty Sword First and 1998's Bounty Sword: Double Edge.</resource>

You can either compete in an exhibition mode or play in career mode and become the greatest of all time.

The set of punches in the game is pretty much standard, jab, hook, uppercut, even the ever popular but illegal low blow.  Also, for each round and every knockdown you score on an opponent, you get a super punch, a straight shot to the face and is almost unstoppable and connected right could knock out your opponent, but if you miss, you lose your punch for the round.

There are two main displays during a fight, a damage inflict meter in the form of two boxing gloves, one on each side and as a player connects a punch, the glove will show a black area of where the glove connected and a damage meter that show's the two fighters faces.  As the round progresses, the fighter shows more bruises and cuts and starts to flash red when the fighter is getting tired and is the best time to land your super punch.

You control a cross-hair, and press fire while over a Brainy to take or give up control of its motion. Running out of time costs you a life.

The challenge lies in the fact that you can only control the direction in which a Brainy will walk. Once this is set, he will continue to walk until he hits a wall, an obstacle or another Brainy. 

To make things a bit more complicated, there are various obstacles like arrows that change the direction a Brainy is walking in and items than can optionally be picked up.</resource>

Once there was a prosperous kingdom, which was protected by a tower, where a mighty dragon was living. The people of the kingdom were secure with such a guardian. But one man wanted the dragon's power for something else, and this man was the king. He went to the tower and tried to kill the dragon, in order to rob his power.


But the dragon's fury turned the king into a horrible creature, a demon, and his evil essence made his entire kingdom sink deep under the earth. Many years have passed, and now you take control of a traveler named Varik (Ares in the Japanese version). A young woman accuses him of killing her teacher, and in a desperate fight they both fall underground, to where the lost kingdom was buried. You must guide Varik through underground mazes and help him to escape the wrath of his adversary and the demonic inhabitants of the lost kingdom.</resource>

You take control of a young warrior named Ares, who wields a magical weapon, a powerful sword called the Planet Buster. One day, while traveling through a desert, Ares is captured by a warlock named Karl, who is after the powers hidden within the magical sword. Suspecting Ares might have some valuable information, Karl doesn't execute him, but takes away the Planet Buster and throws Ares into his underground prison. Now your primary goal is to guide Ares out of the huge prison full of various dangers, and to get your mighty weapon back.

The game is an action RPG with a heavy emphasis on dungeon crawling. You guide Ares through rotating dungeons, fighting enemies in real-time combat, casting spells, and solving an occasional puzzle. You have the ability to jump forwards and to attack inanimate objects such as doors to cause damage and to break the object.

However those are only distant memories. Ryu and his best friend Bow are apprentices in the Ranger's Guild. As adventurers they take on posted jobs needed by the townspeople. However it isn't long before one job goes awry and Bow is accused of stealing a valuable item. In order to clear his friend's name and find the meaning of his dreams, Ryu will explore the world, eventually discovering the meaning of his dreams and hidden abilities inside himself.

Breath of Fire II is a role playing game. The majority of game is played from a top-down map, however battles are seen from an isometric view. Ryu will form parties from among 8 other characters, each with their own set of skills and powers that will help him discover the truth behind the mystery.</resource>

Brutal Checks. Awesome Stick Saves. 100 MPH One-Timers. This is Hockey With An Attidude.

All the hard-hitting NHLPA players. True NHL-style stats. Real ice-grinding hockey action. In this game you're playing for keeps. Control the blue-line with guys like Leetch and Bourque. Blank-'em in the crease with guys like Richter and Irbe. Take it down the wing and into the slot behind scoring legends like Modano, Yzerman, Bure, and of course, Brett Hull. Can you make the cut? Only the stats will tell. Shots, checks, penalties, and passing percentages. Make it or miss, it's crunch time. And this time, it's for real.</resource>

So a mighty wind machine was made to help everyone breathe. But Mr. Rexo has stolen the parts for the machine, forcing other dinosaurs to guard the pieces!

You must help Bronkie and Rexo find the lost machine pieces by blowing away dust with your lungs, and hitting enemies with your dusters, before the dust returns and everyone chokes on the dust! But don't run into cigarrette smoke or dust storms, otherwise your vision will get darker, and you'll have a hard time finding out where to go, running into enemies all around!

Along the way you'll learn about asthma and how to prevent it, as well as how to react if you're suffering from an asthma attack.</resource>

Players can choose their bowler's clothes, what hand they use to bowl, the spare ball and primary ball they want to use, and also the weight of the balls.

The game offers practice, tournament, and league modes. Practice mode is just a quick game of bowling by yourself. In league mode, players can either compete by themselves or as a team against other bowlers. Finally, the tournament mode features six different tournaments to compete in. A short or long tournament determines the number of players that will be involved in the tourney.

Before hitting the lanes, the player will be informed of the oil pattern of the lane which tells the player how the ball will react to that lane. Bowling is performed by choosing where to stand, then using the two meters that determine the amount of power and spin the ball will have when it's finally released down the lane.

There are a wide variety of furry creatures to take on, and finally the Dalai Llama himself. 

Brutal: Paws of Fury is a standard one-on-one beat 'em up across a variety of levels, with mostly outdoor terrain. You can choose of the many characters. Throughout the game, your character travels across Dalai Llama's island, fighting a series of duels before getting to the final showdown. 

During a duel, you can punch and kick your opponent, try to use special attacks on him/her, or use a &amp;quot;taunt&amp;quot; that restores a bit of your health. Each battle lasts a number of rounds (how many - that is determined in the options menu); once one combatant has won that number of times during the battle, he wins. If the computer-controlled player won, it's game over (but you can still use a continue to start the fight anew); if you won, you move on to the next opponent. Once you have defeated them, you can watch an ending animation, different depending on the character you have chosen. 

Instead of beginning a whole new game, you can fight a single duel, choosing the opponent and terrain. You can choose to fight either a computer-controlled opponent or another human player. 

The visuals are leant towards cutesiness, which makes a change from the gore of Mortal Kombat and the metal of Rise of the Robots.

In the console versions, you start the game without special moves, but get a new one after each successful best-of-three bout. The computer versions drop this feature, though.

Similarly to  Sonic games, Bubsy moves very fast and can also jump very high. Bubsy kills the enemies by jumping on their heads. The levels are large and can be accessed right from the beginning of the game (except the ultimate level), starting in either west or east wing. There are five types of regular levels: Egyptian pyramid, sci-fi space-like environment, a world filled with musical instruments and notes, a &amp;quot;green&amp;quot; level with trees and hills, and a side-scrolling group of levels where Bubsy has to navigate an airplane.</resource>

Bugs is getting into trouble from all kinds of characters including Elmer Fudd, Marvin the Martian, Crusher the wrestler, Yosamite Sam, the three little pigs. Bugs will need to use his experience, wit, and arsenal of wacky ACME weapons in order to defeat the challenges of each location.

Bugs Bunny Rabbit Rampage is a side-scrolling platform game. The player, controlling Bugs Bunny, is able to jump (and squash), high-kick, throw cream pies and use ACME weapons. These weapons are scattered all over the landscape and include such cartoon favorites as bone-shaped dynamite sticks, anvils to drop on heads, Shrink Rays, portable holes and many more. Players will encounter a variety of familiar Looney Tunes characters as enemies and level bosses. At the end of each level (10 in all). players are given a rating based on their gameplay style, which includes how many of these ACME weapons they were willing to use.

There are also many gods in Kypros. Not all the gods could accept the peaceful co-existence of creatures in Kypros, and Daar, the god of darkness, plotted evil schemes until he was defeated and sealed by the god of light, Risk. Years have past, and the evil demon lord Bido is trying to resurrect Daar. According to an ancient prophecy, only eight heroes, the bearers of magic pearls, can stop Bido's evil plans: eight heroes who come from different parts of Kypros, unaware of their great mission. Among those heroes are the young pirate Zan Hayate, the fighter of the wosshu tribe Gonza and his little sister Maimai, the beautiful sorceress Lilian Lancelot, and others. 

Before the eight heroes unite for their ultimate journey, you play their introductory stories. You travel on the world map, visiting towns and dungeons on your way. The combat is turn-based, viewed from first person perspective. Enemies appear randomly. Each hero has his/her own unique techniques to use in battles.

The story and general gameplay of Hachigyoku no Yuushi Densetsu is similar to those of the original  Burai: Jouken for PC-98 and MSX; however, the console versions were developed from scratch and therefore differ greatly from the computer ones, having new cut-scenes, dialogues, battle interface, etc. Perhaps the most important difference gameplay-wise is the linear nature of chapters. In the computer versions, the player can choose to start as any of the eight selectable heroes; in the console versions, the player has to start with Gonza and Maimai.</resource>

    <resource id="637921a2499e664ca910e9f9d4bde2c9ecd963f8" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">The game is set in a fantasy world that resembles the feudal Japan. Long time ago, the first deity, the Emperor of Light, created two gods - from the darkness, the Ocean God, and from the glittering moon, the Mountain Goddess - and sent them to build a world out of the chaos. The Ocean God poured rain over the chaos and created seas and oceans; the Mountain Goddess created the Earth. But the Ocean God became evil. He built a huge tower, which connected Earth and Heaven, and thus the world of men and the world of gods became merged, and the path for demons to invade the Earth was open...

Somewhere on an island called Mamoshima, there lives a young warrior apprentice called Jin. One day he goes to the nearby village, but when he returns, he finds his house has been burnt down by demons, and his sister kidnapped. Remembering the tale of the Ocean God his sister told him when he was a child, Jin realizes he has to find a way to the tower of the Ocean God in order to free his sister. Together with Wokuu, a cute little creature who was human once and wishes to regain her true form, Jin begins the journey...

Bushi Seiryuden is a RPG with an unusual combat system. Whenever you encounter a monster, the standard top-down perspective switches to a platform, on which you and your enemies attack each other. The battles are in real-time, but are divided into turns (calculated by the number of moves you make). before each battle, a number appears on screen which indicates the maximum number of turns you should use to finish the battle. If you manage to stay below the maximum, you'll receive special energy units called Magatama. Depending on the amount of magatama you collect during the game, some scenes will change, and the endings will be different.</resource>

These include Devilman and Mazinger Z, among others. The &amp;quot;CB&amp;quot; in the title refers to the term &amp;quot;chibi&amp;quot;, which depicts characters as smaller and cuter than usual. In that sense, it is similar to the term SD (super deformation) found in several Super Famicokm Gundam game titles.CB Chara Wars began as an original video animation which first aired in 1991. A manga adaptation followed the following year, as did this game. Banpresto published the game in Japan, a company known for creating games with anime crossovers such as the Super Robot Taisen/Wars series.</resource>

However, Wagamama, the queen of Lasyland was jealous and used the power of her magic mirror. The spell that was cast would switch the realms of Bizyland and Lasyland around. The only people left unaffected by the spell were those who were not hard-working: notably the king of Bizyland as well as two children and a robot who were playing that day. Using the king's magic chalk, they must travel over Lasyland and restore enough of a percentage of each area so as to break the spell over each region.

Cacoma Knight is a puzzle-painting game. Choosing one of the three characters, the player will begin each level only able to move around the edges. The player can start using the chalk to move away from the edges and draw a line over the darkened area and reach another edge. Once a section (always the smaller) is &amp;quot;chalked off&amp;quot; from the rest, it will be restored.</resource>

The characters are controlled indirectly using the mouse, as you activate each soldier or group of them by highlighting them, click the left button to move them to a particular spot, and the right button for them to fire guns at an enemy. You can also pick up grenades, which can be used to destroy groups of enemies or buildings (by pressing both buttons at once). 

Each mission has a specific objective, and some feature vehicles such as tanks to make things easier. Your troops can cross water but can't shoot within it, so finding and controlling bridges is often crucial. You can use the arrangement of trees to find hiding places to shoot from, and should watch out for CPU soldiers also doing so.</resource>

There is the Custom mode which let's the player set up an exhibition game between two teams. The player can either choose to directly control the football players on the field or choose to just coach the team by selecting plays and letting the computer control the on field action. Other parameters that can be adjusted are the quarter length, the field conditions, and the difficulty of the computer opponent.

There is also a Tournament mode where the player tries to take a team through a playoff bracket in order to get to the Super Bowl.

MVP mode puts the player in game situations in which the player has to try to overcome.

Demo mode lets the player watch the computer play against itself.</resource>

This task will not be easy as many of Earh's institutions are infested with Scumocides minions, but strength and persistence runs the team into the crusade.

The player chooses one of these four characters, who must fight their way through an army of genetically engineered super-criminal, traveling through a series of locations such as the bank, museum, circus, aquarium, and several others, right through to a planet called &amp;quot;Callisto&amp;quot;, where the evil behind &amp;quot;Scumocide&amp;quot; awaits. All four characters have their own special attacks. Captain Commando can use the power of his suit to shoot electricity through his palms. Baby Head rides around in a mech suit which does more damage. Mack can use short knives. Each location ends with the character defeating a boss before proceeding to the next one.</resource>

This game suffered lots of changes from previous games made by Tecmo, this time you will be playing in a real soccer field and in real time, which means that you need to press certain keys even without having the chance of stopping the time (like in previous games), When a certain player is confronted with a one that he considers his rival (like Misugi and Schneider or Tsubasa and *any other player*, for example) they will have a fight, which is mainly a button smashing sequence. The same goes for the sequence in which a goalkeeper tries to stop any of the special shots.
This game has almost the same story as the Captain Tsubasa J anime, except that this one will finish with a special match against an extra team. So, you'll play across various chapters, playing with Aoi Shingo in Italy or controlling the mythic Ozora Tsubasa in his match against the brazillian prodigy, Carlos Santana (nope, he isn't the singer). You'll also play with Japan national team against the same opponents as they did in the anime version..</resource>

The game is also entirely split screen, with a second player or the computer opponent taking the controls on the second half of the secreen. Players control an aircraft pilot of either the United States or Japanese Empire. Based aboard an aircraft carrier, the player can engage in the following missions: 1vs1 dogfights, strafing runs on enemy ships, dive bombing on enemy ships, torpedo runs on enemy ships and carrier landings. All missions are made up of these elements, however campaign missions also feature the ability to decide which aircraft to bring into battle, each with it's own statistics, and keep track of progress on an area map. When two forces engage each other on this map, players can choose which plane to bring into battle and it will close in a 1vs1 battle with the enemy. In dogfights, both players control an aircraft whereas during ship combat, one player controls an aircraft and the other will control the ship's turret gun. Aircraft controls include being able to tilt left and right, climb, dive, increase speed, decrease speed, fire guns, release bombs/torpedoes (if present) and do a 180 degree loop. Turret controls are more limited, only allowing the player to aim left and right, fire the gun and zoom.</resource>

Now it's up to Casper and Dr. Harvey's daughter, Kat, to find a way to rescue Dr. Harvey. To accomplish this task, they must find seven Cellular integrator capsules located throughout the Whipstaff Manor. Once found, the capsules can be used in the Lazarus Machine.

Players take control of a floating Casper, who is followed by Kat throughout the Manor. Gameplay consists of Casper picking up items that he will be able to morph into, enabling him to fight off various enemies and to also assist Kat in getting through the mansion unscathed. Examples of some of the items Casper can turn into are a butterfly net, a pillow, and a plunger. Casper also has the ability to turn invincible as a defensive maneuver. Casper can leave the screen that Kat is on, but if he strays too far away from her, she will be abducted by a ghost.</resource>

The basic gameplay is similar to Gauntlet, but in an open air setting, with bridges across rivers and such in the maps. The visuals are in the 'metallic and blue' style the Bitmaps appeared to favor.

There were 6 characters available in the game, each with different strengths and weaknesses, and different starting prices. In 2-player mode you each chose a character and played co-operatively, but in one-player games you also choose a character for the computer to control, with its Artificial Intelligence allowing it to open doors, pick up power-ups and take on baddies away from the ones occupying your character.</resource>

As the planet is dying, it is your task to build the necessary mystic rooms in your caves to channel the energy back to the planet, but the surface-dwellers think that you are to blame for the current situation and constantly send waves of explorers and adventurers trying to clear your &amp;quot;dungeon&amp;quot;.

The game is played from a top-down perspective using a 2D engine in different phases, first you can roam your cave freely, molding the walls at your discretion by simply pushing and pulling into them to create the rooms needed to channel energy into the earth or create upgrades for your character, summon monsters to aid you, etc. When a timer runs out you proceed to a menu-based interface from which you control the energy production and decide what to upgrade, equip, etc. rinse and repeat for a new turn. Each turn brings new challenges in the form of surface-dwelling adventurers, which you must fight with your weapons and magic spells while attempting to build your rooms. 

Whenever you reach a certain quota of energy production you get to move on to another scenario in a different cave. As mentioned you can create summon rooms to invoke creatures that can aid you in combat, help you gather energy and other resources, etc. etc. 

Depending on how you place you rooms according to certain Feng-Shui principles you get bonuses and upgrades and you will also face cave-dwelling monsters that you must defeat and other NPCs that may or may not aid you.</resource>

Chester leaves peacefully in a zoo with other animals, until the big brute Mean Eugene steals his beloved motor scooter. What's worse, without knowing how to handle the scooter, Mean Eugene broke it to pieces and threw them away. Now it's up to Cheetah to travel across the zoo and to retrieve parts of his scooter.

The game is composed of platform levels. On each level there is a hidden scooter part, which Chester has to recover before being able to exit the level. On the way there are various creatures that will try to eliminate Chester and obstacles to watch for. Chester can dash and stun enemies by jumping on their heads.

    <resource id="a06e1105bb47b6dc9c7ff9f8734a0d991beaaeb0" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Chinhai is a puzzle game for the Super Famicom and a variant on Mahjong Solitaire, or Shanghai. Instead of pairing and removing any two tiles that match as long as one of their sides is clear, as is the case in Shanghai, the rules of Chinhai require that the two tiles can only be removed if it's possible to draw a line between the two that doesn't make a 90 degree turn more than twice. Two tiles on opposite sides of the board, for instance, can't be paired because it would take three 90 degree turns to draw a line between them. To account for this added difficulty, the game lacks the &amp;quot;stacks&amp;quot; of tiles that frequently appear in Shanghai, instead presenting a flat board of tiles.Chinhai is named for the municipality of Chinhai in China, maintaining the theme of naming mahjong solitaire variants after territories in China. Chinhai has long since been renamed Zhenhai, which is situated in the Ningpo Prefecture and now part of a much larger city. This mahjong solitaire variant is perhaps best known as Sichuan or Shisenshou, also named for a province in China.</resource>

While the controls and basic gameplay haven't changed significantly, and the main goal of each level is still rescuing a certain number of hostages, Choplifter III is faster and more action-oriented than earlier Choplifter games.

Enemies appear in larger variety and numbers now. They reappear more often and some levels feature fights against large bosses. To compensate for this, there are more power-ups (such as missiles, bombs, invisibility, etc.) available, and it is possible to have the helicopter repaired at certain points in a level.

Instead of being another side-scrolling shooter, Bakuretsu Rantouden is actually a one-on-one 2D fighter a la Street Fighter in which the most recognizable characters from the Cho Aniki series (yes the speedo wearing bodybuilders included) fight each other for ultimate supremacy using special attacks and moves.

An interesting feature is that the game honors it's shooter roots, therefore instead of being restricted to walking backwards and forwards in the 2D plane and jumping around as in other fighting games, in this game all the characters can fly meaning the fights actually occur in mid-air allowing the players to dash all over the screen. Includes single player and 2-player vs modes.

Hikaru, Max, and Millia take flight to defend the earth from Zentraedi, robots, more robots, and giant space crab-bees. Now is the time to scramble Valkyrie again. 

When starting a game or continuing the player picks from either Hikaru, Max, or Millia. Each flies a custom Valkyrie with its own set weapon load-out. A Valkyrie changes its weapon and movement speed by switching between its three forms: Fighter, Gerwalk, and Battroid. Typically the Valkyrie weapon shoots straight and quickly, the Gerwalk weapon shoots around or through obstacles, and the Battroid weapon does higher damage in exchange for reduced firing rate. Each weapon can be upgraded up to twice by picking up power up items dropped by special enemy ships, but one level of power up will be lost any time the Valkyrie is shot. If a Valkyrie's entire life bar is depleted then the full stage must be repeated, provided the player still has enough continues.

In a nod to Galaga the player is able to capture some enemy craft to increase their firepower. If the player does not shoot any weapons for a few seconds a field of electricity will cover the Valkyrie. Touching some enemy ships will then cause their targeting to be shorted out and make them friendly to the player, following along and shooting or ramming onscreen enemies.

He will be thrusted into the ultimate trip through time and space, encountering new friends, defeating the forces of evil, and encountering the one who would destroy the flow of time.
Chrono Trigger is a role-playing game, with the usual game mechanics fare. As the characters grow in power, not only their ability scores increase, but they also learn new &amp;quot;Techs&amp;quot;.
The game utilizes the ATB (active time battle) combat system from Final Fantasy game. Apart from normal Techs, it is possible to use Double and Triple Techniques.There are no random battles in the game, as all the enemies are visible on screen, and it's even possible to just pass by them entirely.
The game allows you to face your ultimate adversary at different points of time, which leads to several different endings.</resource>

The game is a side-scrolling platformer where you gain power-ups that let you transform into various forms to help you reach the end of the level.  After each level, you are placed on the world map and given several robots who blindly walk forward until they hit an obstacle, then turn at a right angle and continue on their way.  It's up to you to manipulate them to help you clear a way to the next level, where more challenges await.</resource>

Sly must fight thugs and the elements as he tracks down suitcases of stolen cash dropped around the peaks of the Rockies. Combat follows the Final Fight standard, broken up by some mountain climbing and running (or 3-D snowboarding on the Sega CD) from avalanches. 

Enemies are the standard brawler crooks, occasionally carrying guns and knives the player can pick up. The game tends to follow a pattern of having you deal with a natural hazard (scaling a cliff, leaping over gaps), then locking the screen down for a fighting segment, nature again, fighting again, etc. The available fighting moves is limited, compared to other games of this type, and the ability to hit an enemy character is noticeably less accurate.

The plot is identical to the film, with levels based off of, or inspired by, scenes in the movie. Animated cutscenes move the story along on the cartridge systems, while brief clips from the film play between levels on the Sega CD.</resource>

The player walks clockwise or anti-clockwise around each node, and can move to another at the moment when their head is touching the node in question. They can also switch direction. By using these two abilities, the player can move across each screen, carefully avoiding obstacles and reaching the end.</resource>

Besides the arcade mode, a Vs one-on-one mode is available with the inclusion of all boss characters as selectable fighters.</resource>

The main levels include a light-gun style shooter, a raft level that is sort of a &amp;quot;avoid the edges&amp;quot; maze game, a slide level where the character must jump to avoid spikes and other obstacles, an on-the-rails platform level, and an overhead 2.5D level.</resource>

One day a magic ruby fell out of the sky and turned both Congo and Congette into half-humans. The ruby also brought forth a demon-kid who prompty kidnaps Congette. It will be up to the newly evolved Congo to travel across the jungles and rescue her.

Congo's Caper is a side-scrolling platform action game. Being the second Tatakae Genshijin game, it is the sequel to Joe &amp; Mac and controls very similar to that game. Players move Congo to different locations on a map, each representing one level. Controlling Congo, the player can move left, right, jump, duck, swim, climb ladders, roll down hills and swing his club to attack enemies. If Congo is damaged or hit by enemies, he reverts to a monkey form. Another hit as a monkey will kill him and use up one of his lives. To return to human form, Congo can collect a ruby or if he collects rubies while already human he can turn into an invincible Super Congo for a short while. Collecting 100 diamonds or 1 big diamond will give Congo and extra life while collecting sapphires will spin the slot machine (and possibilities of bonuses).</resource>

(&amp;quot;Chronicles of the Convenience Store Wars Barcode Battlers: Roll Out, Super Soldier!&amp;quot;) is a strategy RPG from Epoch (developed by SAS Sakata) that is built to work with their Barcode Battler handheld device: a machine that scans barcodes and creates soldiers/monsters with their own individual stats from the data.Versions of Conveni Wars Barcode Battler Senki were bundled with an adapter device that allowed the Super Famicom to read the Barcode Battler's output and add the creatures it generated to the hero's army in-game. The game also provided default characters for players without the Barcode Battler device (which was sold separately, unlike the adapter).The game is a spiritual sequel to Epoch's Barcode World, which provided the same symbiosis between the Barcode Battler and the Famicom.Many of Epoch's later Super Famicom games would have some degree of connectivity with the Barcode Battler, usually providing optional enhanced functions if the right codes are scanned.</resource>

The game quietly began development around 1994, and was canceled soon after interest in the Super Nintendo waned in light of the release of Sonyâ€™s Playstation. Some time ago, Engine Software released a ROM of the game for free download on their website. The download page has since been removed, but the ROM is still easily obtainable. The game was 70-80% completed before it was canceled.</resource>

    <resource id="1b44a3a6995bf5653a6b12fb301ce40d831b7c7c" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">On the day of Snowia's annual Winter Festival, a festival that starts Spring, an evil villain takes the snow goddess statue, preventing the festivities from happening and keeping the world in winter indefinitely. Because the statue is needed for spring to come, the heroes Hyou and Kiyu go on an expedition to return the statue to its rightful place and restore order once more.
Coron Land consists of shooting enemies with the ray gun, throwing enemies, and throwing purple balls called Corons at enemies. Corons can either be generated from downed enemies (Quest Mode) or from random appearance (Battle Mode). Enemies are turned into corons after a certain amount of hits, but will return to their former forms if not dealt with after a certain amount of time. Once an enemy becomes a coron, players may either choose to immediately throw them as weapons or roll them to make them become bigger and cause more harm to enemies when thrown. This snowball effect also works for corons that are randomly dropped.</resource>

The Cosmo Gang were originally attached to a group of redemption games (like pachinko or claw machines) from Namco, but would eventually star in two Arcade games: Cosmo Gang: The Video, a Galaga clone, and Cosmo Gang: The Puzzle.

This game would become the basis of Namco's more well-known puzzle game Pac-Attack, featuring Pac-Man. As with Pac-Attack, the idea is to stack up a lot of the animated face icons (members of the Cosmo Gang) in an unbroken chain and then drop a bomb (shaped like an arrow) that goes down the chain and eliminates them all at once.</resource>

The Cosmo Gang are based on a series of characters that had previously been used by Namco for a redemption game (a type of Arcade machine that dispenses award tokens for winning a rudimentary game, of which pachinko is the most popular variant) the previous year. The subtitle suggests that this is their video game debut. Originally released in the Arcades, Cosmo Gang: The Video was later ported to the Super Famicom.</resource>

Each character has a standard straight ahead punch or kick, a sweeping kick, an uppercut, and a ranged attack that must be charged up. At the start of the game and the end of every level the player can add stat points to their character to increase their HP, defense, jump height, and strength of normal and special attacks.

A 2 player versus mode is included as well. Both players can choose from the three main characters, and the second player can additionally choose from one of the four normal enemy types.</resource>

Shin-chan is always getting in trouble with his parents and saying bizarre or offensive things to everyone he meets. Every so often, though, he'll try to do what his mom wants him to, but more often than not, he'll misunderstand and simply confound his parents further.

Arashi o Yobu Enji (&amp;quot;A Kindergartner Called Tempest&amp;quot;) is one of many games based on the manga and anime created by Yoshito Usui. In four stages, each made up of five areas, Shin-chan must explore his neighborhood looking for a specific object. He can enter houses to ask people for information, but will often end up simply insulting them. He must also avoid or knock over the other children in the neighborhood, and has various ability cards that he can use to assist him, which might give him a water pistol or refill his health. After finding what he's looking for, Shin-chan will move on to the next area.

Also included is a minigame mode with eight different minigames, such as a bubble-blowing contest, a three-legged race, and a desperate search for clothing before school. The entire game, including the minigames, is filled with dialogue containing the same humor as the source material.

Many of the bosses are transformed versions of Shin-chan's friends and family.

The game is a standard side-scrolling 2D platformer - common with licensed games - though it is notable for letting players decide which order they want to tackle stages, not to mention the franchise's penchant for weird/gross-out humor.</resource>

But one day, several dark clouds appeared over the kingdom and poured down a devastating rain. And then one of the clouds turned into a demon, and, reaching its hands to the treasure room in the palace, took the crystal away. The demon lord, still in a form of a menacing dark cloud, started spawning monsters and sending them to attack the now helpless kingdom. The king called to the heavens for help. Eight magical weapons fell on the ground, and eight warriors rose to protect their country. Your task now is to cleanse the land of the monsters and to defeat the evil demon lord.

&amp;quot;Crystal Beans&amp;quot; is an action RPG based on fighting and dungeon crawling. You can play as either of the eight initial character classes: Fighter, Warrior, Bow-man, Wizard, Priest, Kage (a kind of a ninja), Monk, or Witch. In addition, there are four secret classes you discover during your journey. Each class has its own strength and weaknesses, and two unique attack types.</resource>

The crew of the starship Swordfish are in an engagement with space pirates when the battle takes a turn for the worse. In desperation, the crew activate their jump drive without a destination... and end up flung across the galaxy to the galactic core. The Swordfish however is badly damaged with many casualties including the captain. Only 26 of the crew survive, and of them only 6 are qualified for combat: The commander, two soldiers, a mechanic and a doctor and six giant &amp;quot;Module&amp;quot; mechanized suits available for them. These survivors locate planet Farworld, apparently colonized by humans. There they discover the colony is under attack by a relentless mechanical aliens dubbed &amp;quot;Berserkers&amp;quot;. The crew of the swordfish must fight back against the Berserkers and explore the galaxy for some means to return home.

Cyber Knight is an RPG with a science-fiction theme of being lost in an alien galaxy. The game takes place in a top-down view for movement on planets and areas, a side-view for combat sequences and a first person menu system when aboard the Swordfish starship. The Swordfish can travel between stars, scanning worlds for information. If the ship is able to land on a planet, three crew members piloting three Modules (giant robots) can be selected to debark and explore the planet. Many planets will have towns or people living on them which can be talked to in order to uncover information. Different quests are assigned in order to find the items necessary to progress. There is no system of currency or buying items. Instead, many defeated Berserkers leave behind &amp;quot;NeoParts&amp;quot;, which can be brought back to the Swordfish's lab. Analysis of these Neo parts unlocks enhances statistics (endurance, agility, accuracy, etc) for the Modules and new weapons for them to carry. The six modules are unique in statistics, and also the six pilots each carry different skills.

Combat takes place in turn-based combat on a 6x6 squares field. Seen from the side view, the three modules can be positioned in relation to enemies in order to attack, using a variety of melee and long-ranged weaponry. Ammunition is unlimited, but each module also carries a number of &amp;quot;options&amp;quot; that are consumable attacks. Each Module has two sets of hitpoints: one for the pilot and one for the module itself. If either one of these reaches zero, the module is destroyed. In order to heal, the party carries 10 each of repair kits and first aid kits, which must when not in combat. These kits, as well as options and defeated pilots or modules can be restored by returning to the Swordfish.</resource>

However during their time away, the Earth Federation has been taken over by the ambitious General Forrest, who seeks to wage war on the independent systems and conquer them. Recognizing the potential weapons that could be made from the Berzerker science data, Forrest impounds the Swordfish and jails it's crew. The Berzerker data is used to create &amp;quot;Overtech&amp;quot; and bring to life &amp;quot;Metalliforms&amp;quot;, self-replicating war machines. The Swordfish crew manages to escape, thanks to a mysterious agent &amp;quot;CJ&amp;quot;, and are recruited into the resistance against the Earth Federation. Given a new spaceship, the Galvodirge, they must travel the galaxy to different human civilizations and devise a plan to stop Earth's attack.

Cyber Knight II is an RPG with science-fiction themes. As in the first game, much of the game takes place in a top-down view for movement on planets and areas, a side-view for combat sequences and a first person menu system when aboard the Galvodirge starship. The Galvodirge can travel between stars, scanning worlds for information. If the ship is able to land on a planet, the crew can debark either on foot or using combat modules (mechs). Some areas are only accessible using modules and others (such as towns) do not allow the use of these war machines. Many planets will have towns or people living on them which can be talked to in order to uncover information. Different quests are assigned in order to find the items necessary to progress. There is no system of currency or buying items. Instead, many defeated enemies leave behind &amp;quot;NeoParts&amp;quot;, which can be brought back to the Swordfish's lab. Analysis of these Neo parts unlocks enhances statistics (endurance, agility, accuracy, etc) for the Modules and new weapons for them to carry. 

The crew are divided into a three person &amp;quot;combat team&amp;quot; and a three person &amp;quot;support team&amp;quot;. If modules are used, they can be assigned from the ship's hanger. Unlike the first game, modules only perform a combat or a support role, and each is unique in statistics and the type of weaponry it can carry. When combat occurs on the main map, the support team will often deliver the first strike by firing missiles into the enemies. When searching facilities, caves or other locations, the support team is not available. Following either case, the combat team engages the enemy in turn-based combat on a 6x6 squares field. Seen from the side view, the three modules can be positioned in relation to enemies in order to attack, using a variety of melee and long-ranged weaponry. Ammunition is unlimited, but each module also carries a number of &amp;quot;options&amp;quot; that are consumable attacks. Each Module has two sets of hitpoints: one for the pilot and one for the module itself. If either one of these reaches zero, the module is destroyed. In order to heal, the party carries 10 each of repair kits and first aid kits, which must when not in combat. These kits, as well as options and defeated pilots or modules can be restored by returning to the Galvodirge.</resource>

Alliances are made, forming two major sides: The Axis and The Federation.  The elite units in these wars are Assault Suits, man-piloted combat mechs called Assault Suits.  Jake is one such pilot, drafted into the Pacific States' Marine Corp under the Federation. During his training, the war has grown substantially and upon being assigned to a platoon, he is immediately thrown into combat.

Cybernator is a side scrolling mech combat game and platform game. The player controls Jake as he moves his assault suit left and right on the battlefield. The assault suit can jump and use a jetpack for a short time to increase altitude. The assault suit begins with a Shot machine gun weapon that spreads out fire in front, and a Punch weapon for close melee. Additional weapons can be found during the course of the game and existing weapons improved by the gathering of &amp;quot;P&amp;quot; power-ups, left by defeated enemy. Each level contains a variety of enemies and an end boss which must be destroyed to reach the next level. Some levels take place as horizontally scrolling shooters, in which the Assault suit can move up, down, left and right on the screen... but is constantly advancing towards new threats.</resource>

Based on the manga/anime by the same name, Cyborg 009 is a side-scrolling platformer in which the player takes control of 8 different cyborgs, using their special abilities to complete several missions. 

Their special abilities are as follows:
002 can fly and hover in the air; 003 can see in the dark; 004 can fire bullets from his fingers and rockets from his knees; 005 can break rocks with his fists; 006 can blow fire that also melts rocks; 007 can take on different shapes including those of enemies; 008 can swim underwater for extended periods of time; 009 can move at very high speeds. (001 is a baby and can't be taken on missions). Using these special abilities consumes SP that slowly regenerate. 

In addition to their special abilities, the cyborgs also have four attributes that govern their attack and defensive powers, their amount of SP and SP regeneration speed. 

Before every mission, one cyborg is assigned leader and two more can be selected by the player. Only one cyborg can be controlled at a time, but it is possible to switch between cyborgs at any time. All cyborgs share the same HP and SP-bar. Throughout the levels, experience points can be collected and used to increase a cyborg's attributes after a completed mission.</resource>

In this game, Duck Dodgers sets out to stop Marvin the Martian from performing various notorious deeds, including destroying his beloved home-planet, Earth. There seems to be only one way to stop Marvin - and that's to destroy all five of his deadly machines!

Gameplay-wise, this is a standard platforming affair. However, you can also shoot at your enemies using an array of weapons, fly around with your jet-pack and defend enemy fire with your shield.

The goal is to learn as much knowledge as possible, earn plenty of money and make their teachers and parents happy. Instead of having a target square to reach in order to continue onto the next phase of the game, the players simply move around a circular board experiencing events every turn as weeks and months pass, with new elements and new areas of the board added after certain dates.</resource>

    <resource id="a56c343073f57e07aeec62d1cb456cd4c533532e" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">The magical land of Shelldorado is populated by creatures who look like beasts, but possess a great wisdom despite their appearance. A long time ago, the land was attacked by the Demon King Fattobajah. The Demon King was only defeated by the power of the four great elemental shells - Fire Shell, Water Shell, Air Shell, and Earth Shell. In the ultimate battle, Fattobajah was sealed by the magical Aura Balls, and the Balls themselves were sealed in a crypt in Dorado City, so that the Demon King could never reawaken.

Years have passed, and a disaster occurred. Several meteors  fell to earth, causing huge tidal waves. The Shell-beasts realize it must be another Aura Ball, one they have not sealed. They call the Hero of the Fire Shell back to Shelldorado. He must seal the new Aura Ball, but he can do that only after finding the other Shell heroes. The Hero of the Fire Shell is you...

The game is a traditional console-style RPG with random battles and turn-based combat, viewed from semi-third-person &amp;quot;over-the-shoulder&amp;quot; perspective. There are a lot of party members to recruit, the Shell heroes as well as optional, secret characters. The party members you find might have a unique skill which can be required to solve puzzles. At one point in the game, you'll also be able to build your own town.</resource>

As with many others in the series, the goal is to defeat the other side by taking over key strategic locations, use those locations to produce new units and overwhelm the enemy forces who are busy attempting to do the same to the player. These scenarios play out with one player moving all their units, and then allowing the opponent to take their turn. In these respects, it is not dissimilar to Intelligent Systems' Nintendo Wars series. The &amp;quot;Expert&amp;quot; subtitle was added to the Super Famicom games in the series. The next (and last) Super Famicom game was titled Daisenryaku Expert WWII: War in Europe, which was released four years later</resource>

The action takes place on both the Eastern Front and the Western front. The final battle involves either defending Berlin or attempting to occupy it. Like most Daisenryaku games, airplanes can only be manufactured on airports, ships can only be manufactured on docks, and land-based units can only be manufactured on urban hexes that are closest to the headquarters. Dive bombers can destroy cities and airports, destroying people and supplies. Even when retreating, enemy combatants can still catch up to the retreating units and knock them out, providing that they have enough ammo and gasoline to do the job.</resource>

Darius Twin is a side scrolling shooter similar to other games in the Darius series. You'll fly through a series of different stages, each with numerous enemies and ending with a large boss. You begin the game with a limited amount of fire power, but after shooting certain enemies power ups are left behind to increase your capabilities. Unlike many of the Darius games, if your ship is destroyed you don't lose all of the weapons you've collected; likewise you also continue on at the same point rather than being sent back to a checkpoint. Similar to many of the Darius games there are different routes that can be taken towards the final stage. At the end of each stage, you are shown a map and can select the next stage you would like to complete.</resource>

They were inseparable in the beginning, and gave birth to each other. Rukyu appeared before all the other creatures, the great demon of darkness, later to be known as the Satan. The divine hero-god Roda went up to his dark realm to defeat him, but was struck down, and presumed dead. But the hero couldn't die so easily: he swore to defeat Rukyu once and for all. Meanwhile, Rukyu doesn't just stay in his realm, waiting for Roda: he goes out to the world as a death-bringing sorcerer, and he is out for Roda...

The game is quite different from most other RPGs, because it lets you play as both the &amp;quot;good&amp;quot; hero and the villain. The game is divided into chapters, and each chapter is played by either Roda or Rukyu. You switch the two heroes chapter-after-chapter, and lead them to their ultimate battle from two opposite sides. The entire game, including the battles, is viewed from an isometric perspective. The battles are random and turn-based, and the battle field is divided into squares you can position and move your characters on. Both Roda and Rukyu can have party members join them, and both attack mostly with magic. Rukyu uses a special energy called &amp;quot;Soul Power&amp;quot;, while Roda cast one-time spells from scrolls he receives after battles.</resource>

    <resource id="5ce9cfca066f923b5b3a30ecc8dce85339be0685" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Three-hundred years ago, there were two kingdoms on the earth -Reyfore, ruled by the benevolent and mighty king Reynard, and Amugnon, ruled by king Daruk. The two kingdoms could have lived in peace, but pride took over king Daruk, he didn't respect the Goddess any more, and as a result his mind became obsessed by the idea of destruction. Daruk attacked Reyfore, and for decades war was embracing the two kingdoms, setting the Earth in flames. After a prolonged battle, king Reynard defeated king Daruk, and a reign of prosperity began once again.

But can evil be truly defeated? The hero of the game, a young adventurer, falls down from a cliff while taking a stroll near the ancient Sophia Temple. He is saved by an old man who lives with his daughter Refia in a small country house. But one day, a demonic-looking knight appears, accompanied by monsters, kills the old man, and kidnaps Refia. The old man recognized the knight - it was king Daruk! Now the hero must bring Refia back and defeat Daruk once and for all.

The game has a less linear structure than a standard console-style RPG: together with the main story there are many missions, or &amp;quot;scenarios&amp;quot;, which are not obligatory to complete, but which occupy a large portion of the game. In the beginning of the game you create a party of four characters, the hero and his three companions. The battles are pre-determined and take place on the same screen as the gameworld itself. Your party and the enemies can move freely around the screen and attack with melee and ranged weapons, and their actions depend on the amount of action points they have. Navigation in town is menu-based.</resource>

In the head to head exhibition mode, the player can choose their opponent (with the higher ranked opponents being better than the lower ranked ones). The tournament mode allows for 16 different players to compete to become the champion. Both of these modes can be played on either grass, hard, or a clay court. The player can also choose whether to be either a left or right handed tennis player.

During the game, whoever is serving the ball will be closer to the screen. Players will be able to use topspin, execute drop shots, perform volleys, lobs, slices and overhead smashes, and decide on either a hard or soft serve to keep the opponent off balance.

Although the game features fictional players, it is endorsed by Footlocker.</resource>

The game features both a story mode, which follows the plot of the manga, and an exhibition mode that allows the player to go straight into a match.

The game features a &amp;quot;dramatic&amp;quot; perspective that is also slightly turn-based, similar to the Captain Tsubasa games. A window demonstrates what is happening - a ball is passed, a shot is thrown, the tip-off - in dramatic comic book style that is reminiscent of the manga. While a player's athlete has the ball, the player can pull up a menu that allows them to choose to pass, shoot or look at the present characters stats - each character has their own strengths and weaknesses that the player should keep in mind.</resource>

    <resource id="b042f25699352ed756ed81b75cc05da0cac23aa2" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Demolition Man is a game based on the 1993 movie by the same name. As with the movie, the game takes place in a dystopian Los Angeles, in 1996. John Spartan is the country´s most fearsome cop and hunts his nemesis, Simon Phoenix. However in doing so, he kills several innocent civilians and both characters are sentenced to cryostasis rehabilitation where they will be brainwashed for 30 years. However the brainwashing does not go as planned and upon waking up, Phoenix goes on a new crime spree. However in 30 years the world has also changed and Los Angeles has become San Angeles, a utopian and violence-free society. As a remnant of a more violent past, police officer John Spartan is once again sent to capture Phoenix.

Demolition Man is a fast-paced platform game, with some levels taking place in an overhead perspective (similar to Smash TV). As John Spartan, the player will spend most of his time shooting endless waves of &amp;quot;cryocons&amp;quot; released upon the antiseptic world of the future. The standard weapon can be upgraded with a shotgun and magnum, both with limited ammo. Additionally, various types of grenades can be collected, which are thrown independently of the firearm. Simon Phoenix appears as a boss character at the end of every level that is directly tied in with the movie.

The Sega CD version of the game retains identical levels and gameplay, but adds digitized clips from the film to introduce levels and advance the plot.</resource>

Once, the world of demons and the world of humans co-existed in harmony. But then six mysterious crests fell from the sky onto the earth, crests of six elements: fire, water, air, earth, time, and heaven. The demons became obsessed with the crests and with the power hidden in them, and so a civil war started. Finally, the Red Demon named Firebrand got all the crests but one - the crest of heaven. The Dragon Demon possessed this crest, so Firebrand decided to confront him. He defeated the Dragon Demon, but was himself severely wounded in battle. While flying back, he was knocked down by a mysterious enemy and lost his crests.

You control Firebrand, a flying red demon, and your mission is to help him to gain his crests, and to defeat everybody who stands in his way. This is a platform action game: you fight the enemies in real time (using magical attacks), avoid obstacles, collect healing potions on the way, etc. Firebrand can also fly for a short time.</resource>

    <resource id="394fabf54842bb8f86a56f1f8a3b0eb2c3a00678" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">This game brings the US cartoon character Dennis the Menace's menacing treatment of poor old Mr. Wilson to the computer screen, around the time of the film also released in 1993. 

Dennis is a platform game across settings such as Sewers, the Park, and Mr. Wilson’s house, each of which has an end-of-level bad guy. The in-level opposition follows standard attack patterns and can usually be avoided. The enemies regenerate as you move on, although you generally only progress from bottom-left to top-right anyway. 

Some of the holes in the ground are deadly while others lead to secret rooms. Fortunately, you are given up to 9 lives at the start, and lots of extra lives are on offer throughout the game, so these are well worth checking out. A choice between music and sound effects is offered.

The mission is to neutralise the offensive forces of the Zarak army, who have recently invaded a smaller neighbouring country. The Zarak army has many ground units, including tanks, stinger-missile launchers, SCUD missiles and armored vehicles.

To accomplish the ultimate goal of defeating the Zarak army, players venture out on numerous missions (called &amp;quot;sorties&amp;quot;) that have varied and specific objectives. Typically, various installations such as radar sites, air bases or ground units are the target. Other missions include disabling an oil-pipeline and destroying SCUD launchers before they fire. </resource>

    <resource id="cee8fc2fc4a61158c5d49de717264dd77c7af8d3" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Dharma Doujou was originally released in the arcades by Metro3D in 1994 (picture on the left). While the original version provides the same gameplay as the Super Famicom version tested here, the game does have some noticeable differences. First of all, it has more enemies and features colorful backgrounds borrowed from traditional Japanese themes and myths (well, in the Korean version of the game, Metro3D apparently threw in a couple of bikini girls for good measure). Additionally, the arcade game only contains a story mode and there is no progress map or alternate game modes like in the Super Famicom port. But, most importantly, the gameplay is slightly different - the player has to move the character around the screen in order to hit a block with the mallet. The Super Famicon version, on the contrary, automatically aligns the player with the furthest most block, and this apparently minor difference makes the gameplay of the home conversion more fast-paced and enjoyable than the original.</resource>

There is also a practice mode that shows players the controls of the game and helps get them started. The game also contains two-player action that allows friends to compete head-to-head.</resource>

Little do they know that the big screen is actually a time machine. When Timmy touches the remote they are both sucked into prehistoric times. Now in order to return home they must reclaim a time machine fuse that was stolen by some Neanderthals who go by the name of &amp;quot;The Rockies&amp;quot;. The Rockies are also looking to destroy DinoCity, so two dinosaurs named Rex and Tops decide to help out the two human children in their fight against the Neanderthals.

Gameplay involves one of the humans riding one of the dinosaurs throughout six stages, To defeat the enemies, the player can jump on top of them, punch them, or throw projectiles at them. Defeated enemies may drop eggs. It is also possible for the human to dismount the dinosaur. The human will now be able to jump and reach higher places. 

The player can only take three hits before losing a life. Energy can be refilled by finding hearts throughout a level. Time is of the essence as all stages are timed.

The tracks feature lots of mounds, ramps, pits and other similar obstacles. Parts of a track might also be covered in water mud or ice. To successfully navigate the motorbike through these obstacles, the shoulder buttons can be used to lean the bike, while pressing up or down changes the angle of the bike. Before the game begins, players can choose between four different bikes ranging from 50cc to 500cc (the last bike needs to be unlocked first). The choice of the bike greatly affects the game's speed as well as the overall difficulty.

Apart from the main race, there is also a &amp;quot;Rad Tag&amp;quot; mode. In this mode, a timer ticks down that can only be stopped by hitting the opponent. The driver whose timer reaches zero first loses.</resource>

He later learns that the only way to defeat Amon is by collecting five legendary instruments which Amon has stolen.  The sorcerer placed a curse on these instruments so that their true powers cannot be used and then left them in the hands of his minions.  The only way to lift the curse is by collecting five stars.

Armed with only his bubble shooter, Milon must retrieve the legendary instruments, lift their curses and use their powers to defeat Amon and rescue Alis.

Traveling through many different worlds starting with the forest, Milon will be confronted by many enemies. Milon can either shoot bubbles to trap and send his enemies away, or he can jump and flatten his enemies temporarily turning them into a platform for him to walk across.  

Milon has three different &amp;quot;outfits&amp;quot;: red, blue, and green.  With the green outfit, Milon can withstand three hits.  Each time he gets hit, he will be downgraded a color - green to blue, blue to red.  If he gets hit with the red outfit, he will die and have to start the level over.

By collecting 100 music notes, Milon will get an extra life.  There are also other useful items to get like bubble gum that will save Milon once if he were to fall, a special bubble shooter that let's him shoot multiple bubbles at once and a star that makes Milon temporarily invincible so that he can defeat enemies simply by running at them.</resource>

It was released for the Super Famicom in 1994 and would be the last ever game featuring Dolucky. The game is a mix of Bust-a-Move and Tetris, where the goal is to fire colored blocks at an encroaching wave of same. If five blocks of the same color are touching, they vanish. Certain blocks, gray in color, cannot be removed unless they're touching five colored blocks as they vanish: the goal is to quickly fire five blocks to remove these before they reach the player character at the bottom of the screen. There are also random power-ups that can be acquired. The blocks have facial expressions that change depending on the number of similar blocks they're touching, allowing the player to see how close they are to clearing them if the top of the screen cuts it off. Smiling or grinning suggests that there's three or four in contact.</resource>

As the detective Maui Mallard, he's on the trail of a long lost Idol, which has recently vanished.  Early on, Maui can also switch between his normal self and Ninja Maui, and with all the creepy voodoo enemies he'll encounter throughout his adventure, he's going to need all the help he can get.

As previously mentioned, there are two personalities to Maui, and as a result, two different sets of controls.  Normal Maui carries a bug gun, which can fire a variety of different insect ammo, from basic bugs, to the more powerful lightning and fire bugs.  It's also possible for Maui to combine bugs to pack a more powerful blast at his enemies.

Once Maui starts to find Yin-Yang coins, he'll be able to transform into Ninja Maui.  Ninja Maui has lightning-quick reflexes, and wields a bo staff.  In addition to being handy for whacking enemies, Ninja Maui can also climb between walls by jumping and propping the staff between the walls at the height of his jump.  He can also hook onto duck heads and swing from them to reach areas he normally couldn't.  You'll need to constantly find Yin-Yang coins to fuel your Ninja persona, otherwise you'll run out and transform back to Maui Mallard.

Rool has stolen Donkey Kong's banana stash, and Donkey Kong needs your help to get them back. In search of K. Rool, the Kremling horde impedes your progress. Kremlings, crocodile-like creatures, include Kritters (they succumb to a simple jump on the head), Krushas (they are virtually indestructible), and others. There are also other enemies that block your path, such as beavers, snakes, vultures. Leading them are dastardly bosses, including Very Gnawty, Necky, Bumble B, and Dumb Drum, and they all bar the way with their own special blend of villainy.

Donkey Kong is joined by Diddy Kong: these two primates differ significantly. For example, Donkey Kong is generally stronger; he can destroy most enemies with a single jump and can lift barrels straight over his head to throw them farther. On the other hand, Diddy is faster and not as strong as Donkey; he can run really fast and do cartwheels. Diddy carries barrels in front of him, creating a shield against frontal attacks.

The game is split into different worlds, which are split into different levels. Each level contains bonus areas, where one can collect bananas, medallions, and lives. At the end of each world is a boss, which is usually a larger version of a minor enemy.</resource>

Again the emphasis is on banana collecting, where as every 100 bananas makes one extra life. Apart from beating K. Rool and rescuing Donkey Kong, there are extra missions that can be completed. Collect enough K. Rool Krem Coins to open up the routes to the Lost World, while every level has a hidden Hero Coin to collect.

    <resource id="affe867ee7376195ea841d8d76025ff15f23dc01" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">The Union Aerospace Corporation has been experimenting with teleportation technology on Mars' moons Phobos and Deimos. After early successes, something goes wrong. It seems the scientists have opened a gateway straight to Hell. Phobos base is overrun with demonic creatures, and the whole of Deimos simply vanishes. A squad of marines is sent to Phobos, but all except one are quickly slaughtered. It falls to the surviving marine to grab some guns and strike back at the demons.

id Software's follow-up to their genre-defining Wolfenstein 3D, DOOM is another first person shooter: full-on action seen from the space marine's perspective. Like Wolfenstein, the game consists of distinct episodes, playable in any order. The first episode, Knee-Deep in the Dead, takes place in the Phobos base and is freely available as shareware. The full game continues on Deimos in The Shores of Hell and culminates in Inferno, the final episode which takes place in Hell itself. Each episode consists of nine levels, one of which is a hidden level.

The basic objective in each level is simply to reach the exit. Since dozens of enemies stand in the way, the only way to get there is through killing them. Switches and buttons must be 
pressed to advance at certain points and often color-coded locked doors will block the way - matching keycards or skull keys must be found to pass.

DOOM's engine technology is more advanced than Wolfenstein's, and thus the levels are more varied and complex. The engine simulates different heights (stairs and lifts appear frequently) and different lighting conditions (some rooms are pitch black, others only barely illuminated). There are outdoor areas, pools of radioactive waste that hurt the player, ceilings that come down and crush him, and unlike Wolfenstein's orthogonally aligned corridors, the walls in DOOM can be in any angle to each other. An automap helps in navigating the levels.

Stylistically, the levels begin with a futuristic theme in the military base on Phobos and gradually change to a hellish environment, complete with satanic symbols (pentagrams, upside-down-crosses and portraits of horned demons), hung-up mutilated corpses and the distorted faces of the damned.

DOOM features a large weapon arsenal, with most weapons having both advantages and drawbacks. The starting weapons are the fists and a simple pistol. Also available are a shotgun (high damage, slow reload, not good at distances), a chaingun (high firing rate, but slightly inaccurate in longer bursts) and a plasma rifle (combining a high firing rate and large damage). The rocket launcher also deals out lots of damage, but the explosion causes blast damage and must be used with care in confined areas or it might prove deadly to the player as well as the enemies. Two further (in)famous weapons in DOOM are the chainsaw for close-quarter carnage, and the BFG9000 energy gun, that, while taking some practice to fire correctly, can destroy most enemies in a single burst. The different weapons use four different ammunition types (bullets, shells, rockets and energy cells), so collecting the right type for a certain gun is important.

DOOM drops some of Wolfenstein's arcade-inspired aspects, so there are no extra lives or treasures to be collected for points, but many other powerups are still available. Medpacks heal damage while armor protects from receiving it in the first place. Backpacks allow more ammunition to be carried, a computer map reveals the whole layout of the level on the automap (including any secret areas), light amplification visors illuminate dark areas and radiation suits allow travel over waste without taking damage. Also available are berserk packs (which radically increase the damage inflicted by the fists) as well as short-time invisibility and invulnerability powerups.

The enemies to be destroyed include former humans corrupted during the invasion, plus demons in all shapes and sizes: fireball-throwing imps, floating skulls, pink-skinned demons with powerful bite attacks and large one-eyed flying monstrosities called Cacodemons. Each episode ends with a boss battle against one or two especially powerful creatures.

DOOM popularized multiplayer in the genre with two different modes: Cooperative allows up to four players to move through the single-player game together, while Deathmatch is a competitive game type where players blast at each other to collect 'frag' points for a kill and re-spawn in 
a random location after being killed.</resource>

    <resource id="6cece463bd5bf5d9879826aa01035b4d85f4e0f4" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">The game is based on the animé series &amp;quot;Doraemon&amp;quot;. Doraemon is a blue robotic cat who has the ability to enter dream world and to help the people who live there. In this game, Nobita, a bespectacled friend of Doraemon's, suddenly meets a little fairy. Long ago, humans and fairies lived together in peace, but since the humans started developing their technology, the fairies have no place any more. Nobita and Doraemon travel to the dream world to find out how can they help.

The game is divided into adventure and platform action modes. In adventure mode, you navigate Doraemon from a top-down view, talking to people and entering houses. When you have gathered enough information, a place on the map will be highlighted. If Doraemon (or other characters, later in the game) enters this place, a platform action section begins. In platform mode, Doraemon must overcome the obstacles and defeat enemies by jumping on them or by throwing magic dusk at them, in order to retrieve important items.

It is based on the manga &amp;quot;Doraemon&amp;quot;, that tells the story of a Japanese boy named Nobita, who always gets bullied by stronger kids in the school. In the future, his grandson uses a time machine and send the cat-like robot Doraemon to protect Nobita. In this adventure, Nobita, Doraemon, and their friends travel to the Toys Land. Some evil toys are threatening this country, and it's up to our heroes to help its inhabitants.

The game is divided into adventure and platform action modes. In adventure mode, Doraemon walks around towns, talking to people and entering houses. Key locations lead to platform levels, which must be completed to advance the story. Platform levels include plenty of obstacles (pits, spikes, self-destructing platforms etc.), as well as various enemies who try to stop the heroes. You can choose one of the six available characters to play through the platform level. They all can jump and defeat enemies either by jumping on their heads or by using long-ranged weapons.

It tells the story of a Japanese boy named Nobita, who often gets beaten by other boys. Nobita's future grandson constructs a cat-like blue robot named Doraemon, and sends him to the past to protect Nobita. In this game, a friend of Nobita's finds a fossil. Accidentally, this fossil gets overrun by a car. Nobita feels it was his fault and asks Doraemon to use a time machine to travel back to prehistoric age to retrieve the fossil. 

This is an action platform game with adventure elements. You can control Doraemon, Nobita, and other characters, traveling through platform levels, defeating or avoiding enemies. Each character has his own weapon and possesses a special ability (for example, Suneo can crawl through narrow spaces, etc.) which is often required to complete a stage. In present time, you travel through Nobita's town in top down view, talking to characters and entering houses. There is also a slight RPG element in the game, as you can buy items and upgrade your weapons.

One day, Nobita and Doraemon are looking at the beautiful moon, when suddenly a strange light engulfs them. They learn that something terrible has happened in the Moon Kingdom. Now they must travel to the moon and discover what is going on.

This is a platform action game that is somewhat similar to  Super Mario World. You travel on a world map and enter various platform locations. Before each level, you can choose to play as either Doraemon, Nobita, or other four available characters. You can jump on enemies' heads or shoot at them with various weapons to eliminate them. There are many items and upgrades scattered around the levels, and sometimes it is possible to power-up by using two characters simultaneously.

Combining at least three matching symbols in a vertical, horizontal or diagonal line does not only clear them off the screen, but also deals damage to an opponent. This means that players do not only have to keep their game area clear, but also pay attention to their characters health bar. Once a block touches the top of the screen or the health bar is diminished the game ends.

There are four different icons that have different effects when combined:
Books, swords and rocks deal damage to an opponent by attacking with fireballs, dragons or swords.
Bottles heal a certain amount of health.
Purple blocks have no effect, but clog up the screen nonetheless.

Chain reactions result in particularly powerful attacks or place one or more grey blocks inside the opponents area. They can be destroyed just like ordinary blocks, but they always stay in the same spot and do not fall down.

More complex chain reactions give access to special attacks, up to three of which can be held and activated with the shoulder buttons. Special attacks have different effects that include clearing all purple blocks, using all potions and clearing the bottom three lines.

It's an altered version of the popular Dr. Mario video game and was released only in Japan. It was the last game to be broadcast over the Satellaview.

It is a puzzle game where the objective is to defeat different colored germs using vitamins of the same color. It is basically four in a row just like Tetris (row or column counts) or to put it another way, to defeat each germ, three halves of the same color must be next to the germ. These halves do not need to be on the same pill. The germs will multiply as the levels progress.</resource>

This title features the adventures of Goku from the battle against Piccolo in the martial arts tournament to the conclusion of the Cell Games.

The initially available characters are Goku (without SSJ), Vegeta (without SSJ), C-20, C-16, Piccolo, Freezer, C-18 and Original Cell. But upon entering the right code you can expand the list with Future Trunks (SSJ), Gohan (SSJ), Perfect Cell, Goku (SSJ), and Vegeta (SSJ), all of them relegated to occasionally appear in the Story Mode either as rivals or as alternative selectable characters.</resource>

You can play as SSJ2 Gohan, Piccolo, Vegeta, Future Trunks, Perfect Cell, Cell Jr., Bojack or Zangya. Goku and Broli will be also available after you enter a secret code.

Some basic elements from Super Butouden have remained, such as the split screen system or the special attacks (which now are executed by a shorter button combination). However, now you will also count with the Meteo combos, which allow attacks with multiple hits. You can also hold down buttons in order to quickly recharge your energy. Special moves can be also fired back in retaliation to your rival's attack, marking then the beginning of a button smashing duel.

There are 3 game modes, including a story mode that lets you choose different paths and changes depending on the outcome of battles; a 1 vs 1 mode, where you can battle against another player or the CPU; and a martial arts tournament mode with an eliminatory system in which you and other players (or the CPU) choose a character to become the winner.

Avaliable charachers are Goku, Goten, Kid Trunks, Majin Vegita, Junior Gohan, Kaiohshin, Majin Boo, Darbura and C-18, plus another one available as a secret character: Future Trunks.

Split screen mode is maintained, but now you can now fly up or down while on the same screen as your opponent. You can also struggle with your rival pushing with your arms together to test your button smashing abilities, or execute new Meteor Combos. Scenarios will also be different (mainly based on Buu saga) and will include alternative versions of themselves with different times of the day as well.

The game allows you to take part either in a 8 player martial arts tournament with an eliminatory system or to make single combats against the CPU or another player. This makes Super Butouden 3 the only game of the series without a Story Mode,. It can be explained by the fact that when the game was released the Buu saga was still on a very early stage in Japanese TV.

The game picks up the story where it ended in the previous game, and continues through Piccolo, Saiyajin, and Freezer sagas of the manga. After the battle with the Demon King (Daimaou) Piccolo, the twenty-third World Martial Arts Tournament is about to begin. But to the amazement of the hero Son Goku and his friends, their archrival Piccolo appears during the tournament, so that it quickly turns into a genuine battle.

You control Son Goku and his son Son Gohan, switching between them as the game progresses. The game is basically an interactive comic book in which you can influence the story by choosing to press a button when the game prompts you to make a choice. You'll also participate in battles. The battle system is similar to rock-paper-scissors game, where one kind of move always beats or always loses to another. You can dash into your enemies, attack physically, and perform special moves, pressing the buttons in real time (although the battles are divided into turns).

The game puts you in control of Son Goku only during battles or when there is a possibility to make a choice and to influence the storyline. There is no other gameplay in the game except fighting and picking answers from menu. The fights are one-on-one: you pause them by pressing the start button, and then program Son Goku, making him execute various moves: dash, kick, special attack, etc. Every attack can be countered by an enemy attack, and you have to follow the enemy's move pattern in order to attack and defend successfully.

It follows the events described in the beginning of Dragon Ball Z, the second story block, which tells about the connection of the hero Son Goku with a powerful alien race, and new mighty foes from far away planets. The game starts just where the tale of Dragon Ball begins. Son Goku goes to meet his friends, but is stopped by a mysterious stranger named Raditz who tells Son Goku they are relatives. Raditz demands from him to destroy humanity, and as Son Goku refuses, takes his son Son Gohan hostage. To rescue his son, Son Goku joins forces with his arch-rival, the Demon King Piccolo, who obviously has his own plans concerning Raditz. And thus begins the story during which Son Goku will learn of his true origin...

The game is a RPG similar to the card-based Dragon Ball Z RPGs for NES. During battles, you choose cards from your card inventory, which determine the nature and the strength of your characters' attacks. You can also train your characters in training houses and upgrade their special Ki power. Unlike early DBZ RPGs, you can move around freely in Cho Saiya Densetsu, and your movements are not determined by cards. You can also fly around the world and use your special Dragon Radar to discover location of magical Dragon Balls.

    <resource id="e26fd53bd8ef05d855e6769237617ad04d14ed28" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">This is a remake of two classic NES RPGs - an exclusively Japanese release of the two first Dragon Quest titles on one cartridge.

In Dragon Quest (known as Dragon Warrior in the US), you play as the descendant of the legendary warrior Erdrick, and your goal is to recover the magical Ball of Light from Erdrick's and the humanity's arch-enemy, the Dragon Lord. In Dragon Quest II, you assume the role of the descendant of the hero of the first game, and must join forces with two other characters in order to defeat a demon lord who destroyed a nearby city and killed its inhabitants. 

Both RPGs feature random battles and turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective. In Dragon Quest you fight alone, while in the sequel two other characters can join your party, and you also fight against multiple enemies at once.

The remake includes updated graphics (although they still retain the original NES look), sound of SNES quality, and some changes in the gameplay and in the game world. Certain locations are larger, some menu commands (such as &amp;quot;Stairs&amp;quot;) are omitted, and there is a larger variety of items.

    <resource id="84ce424047e08f8c2f77f01353425535d7bfb119" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Dragon Warrior III is the concluding game of the first Dragon Quest/Dragon Warrior trilogy, and its story takes us back to the time period of the legendary Erdrick (also known as Loto), the ancestor of the first game's hero. You are the son of a powerful warrior Ortega, skillful in physical combat and spellcasting. Your father went out to fight the evil Baramos, who is responsible for the appearance of monsters in your region, and never returned. You are sent by the king on a quest to continue your father's brave deeds and to defeat Baramos.

Dragon Warrior III is a top-down role-playing game where you travel around the overworld, caves, castles, cities and other locations while battling random encounters, buying equipment, and talking to people. You and your party members receive experience when they beat up monsters and level up with enough experience, increasing their stats. The game features a day/night cycle - as you travel, day slowly changes to night and vice versa; shops are typically closed at night. 

You begin with control of just the main character but can quickly recruit three more members to your party. During the game you can choose to drop your current characters and recruit others at any time. The recruitable characters are divided into six classes: soldier, fighter, merchant, goof-off, pilgrim and wizard.

The game has a unique job system, giving you the ability to switch your hired characters' classes after they have achieved at least level 20 in their base class. Characters can switch to the other beginning classes, as well as the sage class, which is not available at the beginning. When a character switches classes, they lose all earned experience points, and half of their stats, but retain all of the abilities of the previous class. In this way, you can create powerful combination characters that are able to cast spells and fight effectively.

&amp;quot;Dragon Quest VI&amp;quot; is the last SNES game of the Dragon Quest series (called &amp;quot;Dragon Warrior&amp;quot; in US). It is a party RPG with turn-based combat and battles viewed from 1st person perspective. Not much has changed since the NES days of Dragon Quest - gameplay style, setting, and even menu layout seem almost identical to those of the early classics. Like its immediate predecessor  Dragon Quest V, this game was never released outside Japan.

One day, his old teacher Raiyas sends him to a nearby cave to retrieve a magical weapon. When the prince returns, he finds the house under attack by monsters. Raiyas tells him to seek help in the castle of a baron, whose country has long been allied with theirs. However, the baron betrays Selios' trust and imprisons him. The young prince manages to escape, but with no way back, he has no choice but to wander around the country, trying to find trustworthy companions who would help him save his country.nnnnThis is a traditional Japanese RPG, with turn-based combat, viewed from the first person perspective. Enemies are semi-random: they appear out of nowhere, but they are visible on the screen, and if you run away from a battle, they will chase you.</resource>

At the age of fifteen, Atlas was already a strong warrior, thanks to the lessons of his teacher Lowel. Everything seemed peaceful in the country, until two warriors spotted strange creatures near the capital city. Those were... men in space suits! Of course, the warriors could not have known this and believed them to be monsters. Do the mysterious strangers have peaceful intentions, or are they a new threat to the kingdom?</resource>

Yume Meiky?: Kigurumi Daib?ken is a first-person dungeon crawler with step-movement and random encounters that plays like a simplified version of the Dungeon Master series template, albeit with a turn-based engine. One of the main differences is the presentation: instead of the usual dank and dark dungeon with grim walls covered by rusty chains, this game has surfaces made of cake and candy. Instead of skeletons and orcs as enemies, it features furry and cute anthropomorphic animals. Once defeated, these creatures occasionally leave behind their skin, which the hero can collect and wear for a change in statistics and new abilities. They also sometimes drop candy, the game's currency. There are several shops on each level: a tailor shop to change and store skins (it is possible to carry a maximum of six skins), shops for potions and health boosts, etc.

When a random enemy encounter occurs, a menu with the options of fighting or escaping appears. After choosing to fight, another menu pops up, which includes the commands Punch, Kick, Talent, Defend, and Item. After choosing either of the first two the player is presented with a grid where an icon (a fist or a foot) can be positioned over a part of the enemy body. This provides a strategic element to the game, as different enemies have different weak spots that can be exploited. The Talent option accesses the special ability that a skin may possess.</resource>

The first world is the Medieval World, land of castles, dungeons, undead skeleton warriors, malicious knights, and lots of keys and doors. The goal is to collect a number of puzzle pieces and get out of the world. Other world themes include Egyptian, Prehistoric, and Futuristic.

Dream TV is a 2-player action/adventure game with only a single player. The player must alternately control both kids throughout the game. The player can either adopt a split-screen view showing both kids, or a fullscreen view that focuses on one kid. The game includes challenges that require the player to use both kids simultaneously, such as a see-saw where both kids need to bounce on either end in order to propel one up onto a higher platform.</resource>

Those humans used to co-exist peacefully with animals, fairies, and dragons - other inhabitants of the world. The dragons were the wisest, most ancient, and most powerful race of all. But humans feared their wisdom and their strength, and lost contact to them, destroying the balance in the world. Now, only a few dragons remained, and their whereabouts are shrouded in mystery...

You control Ralph, a young fighter apprentice who lives with his old master in a small house near a village. It is the day of your graduation, and the master sends you to meet a very important person. When you arrive at this person's hut, you are spoken to by the spirit of a mighty dragon, the creator of the universe!

And there your adventure begins...

&amp;quot;Dual Orb&amp;quot; is a traditional console-style RPG with turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective. As Ralph ventures further on his journey, he discovers companions who will help him on his quest, and join his party.</resource>

The players first controls a prehistoric sea organism, and fights to gain evolution points with which he can improve his fish's body parts and upgrade his attack/defense abilities. The gameplay is not completely linear, which means that certain choices of paths and stages will affect the player's success.
The game is composed of a series of stages, in which the sea organism slowly evolves into an amphibian, and later a land-only creature. The physical changes are fairly scientifically accurate which gives the game a semi-educational purpose as well.

The player is given a stock car and can tune the car from the angle of the spoiler, to the setting of the shocks, and up to the pressure of the tires.

There are three different types of speedways to race on: Super Speedway, Short Track and Road Courses  with 5 different tracks for each to choose from.  Players can choose to race against the computer that has all 23 other stock cars on the track at once or play head-to-head on a split screen against a friend.

It also featured realistic driving physics.  While it didn't have a NASCAR license, it did have ESPN which broadcasted the races and had NASCAR analyst, Dr. Jerry Punch, who lent his voice to the game for the color commentary.</resource>

In Earth Light, the entire arsenal of weapons and troops at your disposal were decidedly &amp;quot;cute&amp;quot; and cartoon-like in appearance (fittingly adorned, I should add, in wardrobes of powder-blue, canary-yellow, hot-pink, lime-green, and sugarplum-purple).  Yes, Earth Light featured purple space cruisers, pink artillery cannons, and lime-green MECHs.  This unabashedly cheerful approach to war gaming contrasts sharply with the more &amp;quot;serious&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;somber&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;gritty&amp;quot; and oftentimes clinical atmosphere commonly found in today's (and yesteryear's) war simulations.

Young Ness was asleep one night when a loud crashing noise awoke him suddenly. As he rushes out of bed and up to a nearby hill, he encounters a strange meteor, carrying a single passenger: a mysterious insect-like being named Buzz Buzz. Buzz Buzz tells him that in the future, an evil alien being known as Giygas has conquered the world, and the only one who can stop him are 4 young kids: 3 boys and a girl. Ness, of course, is one of the chosen ones... Ness now must find the other three children: Paula, a young girl with remarkable psychic powers, Jeff, a mechanical genius, and Poo, the young Prince of Dahlaam. Together, these four friends have the power to defeat Giygas and save the world from his chaotic reign!

EarthBound is a top-down RPG where you travel around Eagleland and various other, exotic countries, trying to end Giygas' evil influence. 

On the way, Ness and his friends will encounter a lot of enemies and battle them in turn-based combat. Each turn, each of the characters in the party can attack with their weapon, use a special ability (some characters have powerful psychic powers that can hurt enemies, heal comrades and more; some also have some other, unique special powers), use an item or try and escape. The game features &amp;quot;rolling HP meters&amp;quot; - when a character is dealt damage, it's not all taken away from his HP right away, but instead his HP decreases slowly; if the combat is ended quickly, even a massively damaging attack can leave a character with only minor injuries. By winning battles, characters receive experience and thus become stronger. 

If your characters are strong enough, weak enemies will escape from them instead of trying to attack them, and when chased down, they will be defeated instantly! 

Saving the game is done by finding a telephone and calling Ness' father. When you defeat enemies, your bank account receives money which can be then retrieved from ATM machines throughout the game and spent in shops to buy better equipment or useful items.</resource>

In Edo no Kiba you are always moving forward, either running or walking (or, in some levels, flying), although you can still move around the screen as in most belt-scrolling games. Your avatar attacks by slashing to the right with his energy sword, and he can also hold his sword defensively to deflect some bullets. By then holding forward and releasing attack he can throw the sword like a boomerang. He can also jump. A bomb follows the avatar around on any on-foot level that can be used to destroy all enemies onscreen at any time, and it will be replaced whenever a life is lost. Environments range from city streets to sewers and a flying battleship. Each level ends with a boss fight against an enemy that can withstand many attacks.</resource>

Filena is raised as a boy because the Empire ruling the country forces girls into prostitution and turns boys into gladiators. After turning 16 Filena prepares to make her debut in the imperial coliseum, however before the battle she and her fellow gladiators are assigned concubines. Filena ignores her assigned bedmate, Lila, but Lila forces her way into Filena's room and learns the truth about her gender. Filena later fights through the gladiator ranks and discovers that their battles to the death are all scripted by behind-the-scenes writers. Filena then sets off with Lila on a quest to bring down an empire and reclaim her rightful place in a lost kingdom.</resource>

There are no experience points or money to be earned from combat; the player's party instead levels whenever an area's boss is defeated, and items like consumables and equipment need to be found on the field by exploring. The player controls heroic warrior Pyne throughout the entire game, but the rest of the party changes as Pyne travels to each elementally-themed region of the world. The developers also hired prolific manga artist Susumu Matsushita to create most of the character and enemy design in the game, as well as the lush intro movie.</resource>

Pine, the hero of the original game, disappeared shortly after saving the world after venturing into a cursed forest to cleanse it of its corrupting influence. In the years since, the world has been taken over by an oppressive theocracy that supposedly acts on behalf of Pine's message. A new hero, Kiba, gets embroiled in a quest to prevent the destruction of the world. The game's combat is focused on two rows of characters: the front row can melee attack enemies while the back-row must focus on ranged attacks for damage. Combat ensues automatically, but the player can step in for certain commands like escaping from battle.</resource>

The game is novel for its use of CD audio, where the player would skip to the correct track when prompted by the game for background music and voiceover, and for its combination Japanese/English subtitles which provided the game's secondary use as an English language teacher. It was released on a number of systems in 1995 and followed by two more chapters: EMIT Vol. 2: Inochigake no Tabi and EMIT Vol. 3: Watashi ni Sayonara o.</resource>

Esparks is the mascot of a stationery brand in Japan owned by Tomy, the game's publisher. It was previously used for a video game in the 1994 Game Boy title Miracle Adventure of Esparks.</resource>

The game scrolls horizontally at a slight angle, and recreates the coin-op's close-up zoom effect after a player scores. Only a small area of the pitch is on screen at a time, but there is a scanner to show the whole pitch.

Although the game has a referee, he often loses attention, and these moments give you a chance to foul, punch or side-swipe opposition players. One and two player options are included.</resource>

You will earn money for each race depending on how you placed (for instance, first place nets you $7000) which you can use to purchase upgrades for your car. You need to find a good balance between the parts. To test the effectiveness of your parts you can run a test race to see how the car works before you buy. Data can be saved on the cartridge so you will not lose your parts or your race statistics. The goal is simply to complete all sixteen tracks; you will get a bonus at the end depending on how well you do so there is an incentive to play again and do better.

Game modes include an Exhibition mode, an All Star game, a Pennant Race, and a Watch mode.

While Exhibition mode can be either a one or two player affair, the All Star game is strictly for two players to compete in. When playing, batting and pitching are both done from a behind the batter viewpoint.

The pennant race involves 6 teams playing each other throughout a season consisting of a number of games chosen by the player.

Watch mode lets the player watch two computer controlled teams play each other.

Options include either having automatic or manual fielding, having errors and/or wind on or off, and being able to either skip or watch opponents pennant games. There is also the Cold Game option, which lets a baseball game end when a team is winning by the  chosen amount of runs.</resource>

Seta's new super DSP chip seperates the men from the boys in this high speed Formula One racing tour. Drive real cars, like the FW14B Williams, Mclarens MP4/7, the F92 Ferrari, the V8 Ford-powered Benettion B192, and other Formula One racing machines. You'll start out in a prototype Group C car and must win on all 8 tracks to move up. Next you race in F3000 cars to develop the lightning-fast reflexes needed to survive Formula One racing. Finally, you face the real 1992 Formula One season drivers and their cars. On the 16 international courses, it's a duel of nerves, skill, grit, and nitro. This game blow the competition away.
A new standard in racing simulation is born and F1-ROC II is it.</resource>

    <resource id="36dc6aab7575a795c37351af7a28fab9b9d099eb" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">The game that started the best-selling series licensed by football's world governing body, this first installment in the long running series used a dimetric (colloquially known as &amp;quot;isometric&amp;quot;) viewpoint, previously unusual in football games but quickly imitated by several titles. The televisual presentation, one of the unique points of the early EA Sports titles, with hosts introducing the matches, was another thing making the game stand out from a market dominated by Sensible Soccer and Kick Off games.

Based on international teams (with fictional player names), their abilities in each skill area rated out of 10 to give the player an overall impression of how good they are. The options available follow the standard set: fouls and offsides can be toggled on and off, the match length can be set, and if the timer operates  continuously, or only while the ball is in play. Gameplay privileges quick runs, short passes and blistering shots outside the penalty box, and set pieces are controlled by moving a box into the target area for the ball, and then passed, lobbed or kicked directly. On the tactical side, formations can be selected, with 5 different strategies also available (although not all of these combinations make sense) as can the team Coverage - the areas which defenders, midfielders and strikers cover.</resource>

It was hailed as the first really successful FIFA release, and opened the way for yearly revisions of the concept.

There were a number of factors that made FIFA96 stand out from the crowd of other football sims. Firstly, the game's commentary was revolutionary at the time -- the renowned British commentator John Motson comments all the incidents and happenings on the pitch in real-time. The ambient commentary is varied, and systems with more than the minimum memory level get extra commentary phrases.

The Virtual Stadium technology has numerous pre-defined camera angles. The game even has a SVGA mode for better-than-minimum system

FIFA96 boasts eleven leagues from all around the world, ranging from the unknown players of the Malaysian league to the celebrated stars of the English and Italian leagues. 59 International teams are also featured, and it's possible to match the teams you want to against each other through friendlies, or you can also choose to play domestic tournaments or International ones such as the World Cup. If you're not satisfied with the composition of the various teams, you can create your own dream team through the custom team creator.</resource>

The man, a private detective named Shunsuke Utsugi, convinces him to become his assistant.

The objective is to solve two cases; the murder of a schoolgirl investigating her school's ghost story, and an older murder nearing legal expiration. Like the previous game in the series, the game progresses as the player chooses from a set of commands displayed on a menu. These commands are used to interact with other characters and the game's environment, examine clues, or review facts. The results of choosing each command are displayed in the text.</resource>

The main hero of the game is a knight named Arc, who is in love with the beautiful priestess Ferio. One day, when Arc and his best friend Randia are out of town, a hostile army under the command of a mysterious Black Knight invades the town and kidnaps Ferio. Thus begins Arc's quest to defeat the enemies and to rescue his beloved one from their clutches.

&amp;quot;Farland Story&amp;quot; consists entirely of battles (save cut scenes and the ability to shop if you are near a town after a battle). During battles, you move Arc and his party over the terrain, and attack when there are enemies in range. The party consists of different classes - knights attack with swords, archers specialize in long-ranged combat, priestesses heal, etc. Every attack leads to a counter-attack, from the enemy's side as well as from yours. You gain experience points for every attack, and can level up in the middle of a battle.</resource>

The game is set in the same time line as the second and the third &amp;quot;mainstream&amp;quot; Farland Story games, 20 years after Arc has become a king. Peace has returned to the world, but on the continent of Ionia, an emperor is plotting an evil scheme. His son Riad refuses to accept the methods of his father, especially when he wants to use Serena, a girl he loves, for his plans of war and conquest. During a quarrel, Riad attacks the emperor's minister, and is forced to flee the castle together with Serena. The adventure of the runaway prince begins...

Graphically and gameplay-wise, the game is similar to other Farland Story games, although its setting is generally more dark. The game consists of large strategic battles, during which you move your party over the battle location, attacking enemies physically when they are in range of your weapons, and casting healing and offensive magic. Like in other Farland Story games, the death of the main character (Riad in this case) means instant Game Over.</resource>

    <resource id="f3eb6d177491251296c31d828c8b60f2bf1701c8" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">In a fantasy world, a soldier from the imperial forces deserts after witnessing the massacre of innocent villagers by his unit. He is sent to jail to be executed, but manages to escape with the help of two former unit colleagues. The group flees through the country-side, while being pursued by imperial soldiers. On their way, they join forces with other rebels to fight against the enemy, while uncovering hidden secrets and evil plots by the Empire.

FEDA: Emblem of Justice is a strategy RPG similar to Shining Force and other titles with preset characters and linear gameplay. The player commands a party of varying size and characters with diverse skills.

In the main battle sections, the player and the CPU-controlled enemy take turns moving the troops and giving orders. A menu at the bottom of the screen shows all the possible actions, where soldiers can defend, move, attack, or use an inventory item on each turn. The range of their movements and weapons vary according to their nature. A crossbow character can shoot from the back, while most sword and knife users have to be adjacent to their targets. Magic offensive powers have different ranges as well, reaching enemies that are far away from the attacking character. Health points can be recovered by eating rations or by magic, where a healer can restore points to several characters at once.

Each party member has separate health and magic points, as well as other statistics like defense and attack power. They receive experience points after slaying an enemy or casting a spell, and extra points at the end of the battle. Their skills increase after surpassing 100 points.

The map screen shows the party and groups of enemies traveling through the landscape in turns. The menu has options for moving the group or camping. In the encampment, one of the characters around the fire pit saves the game, while another inside the tent provides system options to change the interface color, adjust sound volume and rename the party members.

In some locations like temples, villages and towns, the party has to explore the place and talk to the citizens to move on to the next section. In later battles, the player has to make a moral choice about attacking mutated humans. At the end of each battle, the party is assigned a dark or light emblem, and certain party members choose to leave or stay in the group based on its alignment.</resource>

Originally meant to be the Super Famicom port for Fighter's History Dynamite (known in the US as Karnov's Revenge), it was instead modified to be a vehicle for Fighter's History's breakout character Makoto Mizoguchi.

The game features multiple modes. The main story mode involves Mizoguchi chasing down a mysterious masked character after he disparages Osaka's takoyaki, of which Mizoguchi is fiercely protective. Mizoguchi then travels around Japan in pursuit, fighting the other characters for various contrived reasons. There's also a CPU Battle mode in which the player progresses through a more traditional &amp;quot;Arcade&amp;quot; mode with any character they wish. There's also the standard Versus mode for up to two players.

In addition, the game has a Survival Mode (survive as long as possible against an endless string of opponents), a Tag Mode (either combatant can hover around the edge of the screen to switch to a second character) and a Practice mode.</resource>

    <resource id="7859d967018c1a58fb331ecd68153890272ab8f5" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">This is the fourth entry in the  Final Fantasy series. It was known as Final Fantasy II internationally, because the  second and third games were never released outside of Japan.

The military country of Baron is one of the strongest in the land, with a proud army and a majestic air force known as the Red Wings. But, while their armies are kind and loyal, the recent actions of the King are anything but. The young Captain of the Red Wings, Cecil, is ordered to steal a crystal from a village of innocent magicians, and when he questions the actions of his King, Cecil is immediately thrown out of the country and sent off to kill strange monsters. Little does he realize the price the King's actions will pay, and what the true secret of the crystals, and their powers, truly is...

This is the first Final Fantasy game that introduced the famous ATB (active-time battle) system: during the battles, you have a time indicator for each party member that tells you when this character is able to act. If it takes you too long to select a command for this character, the enemy will act without waiting for your turn. The game abandons the job system that was implemented in the  first and the  third game in favor of pre-set character classes (paladin, white mage, ninja, etc.) assigned to each party member.

The PlayStation version adds a new rendered intro and ending.</resource>

People remember it as one of the most horrible tragedies in history. Since the War of the Magi, magic has been all but forgotten, technology began to grow, and people returned to seemingly normal lives. The only true worry people had was the Empire, whose leaders were looking to revive the great force once known as &amp;quot;magic&amp;quot;.

But then...something happened that would change the course of history forever...

The Empire had heard word of the remains of a mystical being, known as an &amp;quot;Esper&amp;quot;, being found in the mining town of Narshe. Quickly, three soldiers were dispatched to find this Esper and bring it to the Emperor. One of the soldiers, a young girl, triggers a power in the Esper that will begin one of the most dangerous series of events ever. And the only ones who can help her are a rag-tag band of rebels and heroes, whose very hearts and souls are the only ones that can save the world from the mad plans of the Empire.</resource>

All seems well in the world, until the wind suddenly stops, the sea begin to grow stagnant, the heat of fire becomes scarce, and the earth begins to wither. King Tycoon, sensing a premonition of evil, hurries off to check on the Wind Crystal, only to witness it destroy itself.

Meanwhile, a young traveler named Bartz is camping in a field when a giant meteor strikes the planet. When he heads out to examine the meteor, he is shocked to find a young girl named Lenna, who is the princess of Tycoon, and an old man named Galuf, who is on a critical mission. Later, joined by Faris, a pirate captain, the foursome must travel the land in search of the destroyer of the Crystals, and save the planet at any cost.</resource>

    <resource id="149dd408ed20ca69e3807bc4b3f5898f076cb335" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">The fourth installment in the popular strategy series, set in the continent of Jugdral, southeast of Akaneia. The game's first fifth chapters follow the Prince of Chalphy, Sigurd -- from there, his son Celis becomes the protagonist. The game uses the same turn-based strategy gameplay as its predecessors, but changes up the promotion system by making it entirely level-based, adds RPG-style status effects, and introduces the concept of the weapons triangle, in that a sword is strong against an axe, spear against the sword, and axe against the spear. Seisen no Keifu also featured much larger maps than previous titles (though a lower number of them -- 12 in all) and a handful of new units, such as the Troubadour, Dragon Master, and Falcon Knight. The game was released late in the Super Famicom's lifecycle in Japan and never published internationally.

The events transpire during  Fire Emblem: Seisen no Keifu and the game contains many of the same characters from that game, while featuring cameos of many more. 

At its most simple the story is of Prince Leaf of Lenster's struggle to free his native land from two forces, the Grandbell Empire and the Loptus religion.

Features introduced into this part of the series include fog of war and night maps with limited vision, this requires characters to use torches and wands to light their way. Also the capture command which allowed enemies to be subdued and their weapons taken.

    <resource id="682f4cfb77cd36edbd01103b2b6d62b5139afd0e" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">A long time ago the kingdoms of wind, fire, earth and water
competed for the Trialight, a weapon created by the Arch Mage Wylde that can only be used by a Firestriker. The kingdom of wind won and united the four kingdoms. Wylde however, was not satisfied with peace and conjured four monsters to overthrow the united world. Now, only the kingdom of wind remains and the player takes control over the last Firestriker to free the other kingdoms and defeat the monsters.

Even though Firestriker looks like a typical SNES RPG, it is in fact an action game that has more in common with a pinball-game than with any other genre. The Trialight is a ball of fire that basically behaves like a pinball. The player controls the Firestriker who can freely walk across the screen and strike at the Trialight to control its movement. Levels are filled with obstacles, destroyable block and monsters. Monsters and blocks can only be destroyed by the Trialight. The goal of each level is to maneuver the Trialight towards the exit of the screen. The exit is usually blocked by destroyable obstacles and sometimes certain conditions (such as killing all monsters or destroying certain objects) have to be fulfilled before a level can be completed. If the Firestriker is killed or the Trialight falls off the screen, the player loses a life. Additionally to the Firestriker, the player can use the shoulder buttons to control a magician who (in single player mode) stays at the bottom of the screen. The levels consist of several screens and are entered from a world map. As the game progresses, the player will also fight several bosses and free other Firestrikers whose special abilities are necessary to complete the game.

Firestriker also features a two-player cooperative mode as well as a duel-mode for up to four players.</resource>

Since there are so many candidates, it is decided that the person who finds the Great Treasure of Sierra Madrock will become the new Great Poobah.
The player takes control over Fred and Barney who also participate in the treasure hunt in order to make Fred the New Great Poobah.

The Flintstones: The Treasure of Sierra Madrock is a side-scrolling platformer that includes several board game elements. On a world map, Fred and Barney  throw dices to determine how many fields they can move. 

There are different fields that hold different challenges.

Most fields require you to finish a side-scrolling platforming level. Fred and Barney can jump, club their enemies and climb trees or stone pillars. Holding down the jump button lets them hover in the air for a short moment. Throughout the levels, different power-ups and items can be found: clamps are used as money, apples replenish some health, 100 stars grant an extra life to Barney or Fred and an empty Heart frame increases their life bar.

On fields marked with a skull, a boss has to be defeated. 

Heart fields hold bonus games in which you have to collect as many items as possible within the time limit.

At amusement parks, several mini-games can be played to win items or extra lives. Mini-games include: Memory; Balls O' Fun&amp;quot;, where you can win items by throwing a ball at them; a mini-game in which you have to stop monkeys from climbing down trees and stealing your items by hitting them with coconuts and others.

In Cafes you can buy food to replenish your health.

In stadiums you can participate in special challenges (3D cart races for example), in order to gain new abilities such as double jumps.

While stadiums, cafes and amusement parks can be revisited, all other levels only need to be finished once.

Fred and Barney are not the only characters that move about the playing field. You will also run into their wives Betty and Thelma as well as other characters that are also looking for the treasure. When Fred or Barney encounter their wives, they are dragged a few fields back. Other characters give them useful items if you can beat them at a challenge (usually a race).

Other notable features are a password system and a competitive 2-player mode.

Gameplay involves the usual football fare of choosing a play and attempting to execute it. On offense, when throwing the football, a meter appears which measures the strength of the passer's throw. On defense, the player controls a defensive player and tries to tackle the opposing ball carrier or attempt to break up a pass play.

There is an option to either play with the background music on or off.</resource>

You can choose pitchers and batters, based on their statistics and form. Bowling options are set to define the delivery, with fastballs and curveballs as well as more precise setting of pace and height. Fielding is optional - it's best to leave this to the computer at first You can always alter the infield and outfield depth and shift.</resource>

The road is full of cars and trucks, at variable speeds. The river water itself is fatal, as are the snakes which hover within on later levels. Frogger must use the arrangement of logs, turtles (which are only there for a short time) and alligators (but stay away form their faces), and then jump into one of the open home-cells, ideally one containing a fly for extra points.

The manga tells of the running track that will make the young hoodlum Hanamichi Sakuragi who joined the basketball club in Shohoku high school just because initially interested in the sister of the captain Akagi but later this sport will conquer him so much that he becomes a real basketman.

The game is essentially an arcade sports title basketball basically. The main screen there will be little choice given the presence of only three modes: Story mode and classic friendly tournament. In the first we follow the events of the television series whose plot differs slightly from the original one: using Shohoku then we will qualify for the national championship. The second and third but I think there is a need for further explanation.

Executable field operations would also be different, you can also feint shots and blow up their opponents markers. Then successfully accumulating a sequence of 'affirmative action' row (steps succeeded, baskets made or avoided), will fill a horizontal bar at the top of the screen and, as he did a little 'in the playroom with the SNK Street Hoop, pressing simultaneously the three keys will not dorsal (except B), you can make a super nice shooting with supplemental animations depending on the player used.

At Huffman Island, located in the the pacific ocean, wanzers are deployed by both the USN (United States of the New Continent) and the OCU (Oceana Community Union), who dispute ownership over the island.  One night, the OCU forces stage a covert recon mission on a facility located in Larcus, a USN-held territory and weapons facility. Lead by a soldier named Roid, this mission was entirely unofficial and violated the peace treaty. During the mission, USN forces lead by Commander Driscoll appeared and ambushed the OCU soldiers. During the combat, Roid's fiance, Karen is killed and the USN facility is blown up; placing the blame on the OCU. This became known as the &amp;quot;Larcus Incident&amp;quot; and the OCU denied all knowledge of it's soldiers actions. Ultimately it would be a leading cause to the second Huffman War. 

One year later, the war is underway and Huffman island is under provisional control of the OCU, but with a weakened military unable to defend against USN attacks. The soldiers involved involved in the Larcus Incident have all been discharged and disgraced. Roid spends his time fighting as a gladiator in the Wanzer fighting arena before being approached by a mysterious man. Colonel Olson has found out about Roid's history and wants him to command a mercenary unit he is assembling on behalf of the OCU, dubbed &amp;quot;Carrion Crow&amp;quot;. Convincing Roid that Driscoll is still out there on the island, Roid agrees.

Front Mission is a turn-based strategy RPG played from an isometric perspective. Players progress in the story through large strategic battles involving multiple units and cutscenes between them. At certain places, usually towns, the player can visit multiple locations including bars and shops, and talk to people. Shops are also found to purchase new weaponry, parts and make repairs. In combat, each Wanzer robot is a seperate unit and, has a large variety of weapons and attack styles depending on what's equipped. Units get experience for defeating enemies and also for using various techniques. The more an attack is used, the more powerful it becomes.</resource>

    <resource id="3649eecfd3e5f772a094e99749ed9f7ecd9d2abb" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">The year is 2064, when the great solar power satellite, ATLAS is overshadowed by the invention of fusion power. The government alliance that had supported the building of ATLAS now find themselves facing economic crisis as the balance of power shifts. In this world of conflict and change, the Walking Panzer, or Wanzer, (a form of mecha) becomes the standard armored unit for wars and petty battles across the globe. For the small nation of Bergen, a coup d'etat is underway, staged by Colonel Ark. Seeking to establish complete control over the government and the NORAD units stationed there, Ark's first step involves the capture of President Orwen. Tipped off to the rebellion, Orwen seeks to flee from Bergen, looking for safe passage out of the seaport of Port Ertothal. A young Wanzer pilot, Albert Grabner, is assigned escort duty to the president by loyal elements of the army stationed there...

Gun Hazard is a side-scrolling version of the Front Mission series. Gameplay is more than a little similar to Cybernator or Metal Warriors. The player moves between different stages on an area map. Once inside a level, the player controls Albert and his wanzer as it moves left, right across the screen. The wanzer is able to jump, and attack with a primary and a special weapon. At any time during a level, Albert can eject from his heavily armed wanzer to explore. Although vulnerable when outside, Albert is able to reach areas the wanzer cannot, in addition to being a smaller target and being able to jetpack indefinitely.

Additionally, Albert can recruit other characters through the normal course of the story, some of whom can be designated to support roles. These support characters when set can provide a variety of different cover fire abilities for Albert during his missions. They too gain experience and levels. Different weapons and armor can be found or bought. Essential components include the Booster ability which allows the wanzer to hover and increase it's jumps, as well as the Dash ability which allows quick left-right movement by the wanzer. Money and experience are earned through the completion of level objectives as well as the kill count of enemy wanzers.</resource>

There are 6 racers in the game, each with their own short profile, including a guy newly out of jail, a token woman and a token African-American. You can race one or both disciplines, racing either an individual weekend or a full championship.

As you play the game you can upgrade your vehicle, with faster engines, better tyres and more nitros. As in Road Rash, throwing your legs out at the other riders is potentially advantageous.</resource>

1. Paint: 

A paint program that offers different tools and brushes, a few pre-made backgrounds and objects as well as the option to import figures that were created in the sub-games 'Stylin' Stuff' and 'mix 'n match'.

Games: 

Mouse Maze: A Pac-Man-clone in which the player guides a mouse through a top-down labyrinth. To complete a level, all cheese symbol have to be collected while cats have to be avoided. Collecting a bone temporarily transforms the mouse into a dog that can kill the cats.

Space Lazer: A  shooter seen from the cockpit of a space-ship. The player controls a crosshair and has to shoot increasingly difficult enemies.

Whack a Clown: This game is exclusive to the Genesis Version and plays like 'Whac-a-Mole' only with clowns instead of moles.

Music: 

Songs can be composed by choosing from several instruments and putting notes onto a stave. It is also possible to add sound effects (animal noises and others) or edit provided songs.

Style: 

This section contains two mini-games:

Stylin' Stuff: Here, the player can edit the sprite of a woman by selecting different clothes, hats or haircuts.

mix 'n match: Sprites can be created by putting together different heads, torsi and legs.

The game moves from rivers to the ocean, and the player fishes off the deck of a boat in various locations. The player has a limited amount of bait, however, so they must be careful not to let too many fish get away.</resource>

He can be seen during the game's intro, and appears in the game as a playable athlete as well.

Like its predecessor, the game heavily features simulation elements, including airing a lot of information about its many athletes including their stats and current fatigue level. This also factors into the swinging and batting which relies a lot on strategizing and using a grid to plan the next angle of attack.</resource>

Many adventurers have tried to find their way to the mysterious land of the Golden Condor, but how many of them have survived the impassable mountain paths, the dark forests and caves, and the vicious monsters? You are the wanderer Shiren, and the goal of your life is to find the Golden Land. Together with your best buddy Koppa, a talking weasel, you decide to venture deep into the dungeons that lead to the land, and to try your luck there.

Furai no Shiren (The Wanderer Shiren) is a roguelike, hack-and-slash game with randomly generated dungeon areas, items, and monsters. Despite being named Fushigi no Dungeon 2 it has no relation to the storyline or characters of the first game in the series, it does however share the same style of gameplay. The movement is turn-based. You visit towns and villages where you can buy and sell supplies. The dungeons are full of various traps and monsters, and sometimes non-playable characters you can talk to, some of which can join you on your quest.

A boy named Gen lives together with his mother in a small Japanese city. One day he goes to the nearby mountains and discovers an underground cave. In this cave, he encounters a strange bat-like creature guarding what appears to be a huge diamond. When Gen approaches the diamond, the floor crumbles, and all he can see is a group of aliens descending on the Earth...

Gen is awakened by a man in a military uniform. He quickly gets up, and notices a calender. The year is 2009! Ten years have passed, of which there is no recollection in Gen's memory. The world has changed a lot during those years. Aliens have invaded the Earth, many cities are destroyed, and he find himself amidst the members of an underground resistance movement. Now he has to travel all over the world, help the humans in their struggle, and discover the secret of the invasion.

The game is a console-style RPG with randomly encountered enemies whom you fight in turn-based combat viewed from &amp;quot;over-the-shoulder&amp;quot; perspective, similar to Phantasy Star IV. Gen and other party members develop special powers called &amp;quot;chakra&amp;quot;, which can be leveled up just like the characters themselves.</resource>

    <resource id="df89a5edc94c8e94def19671e515c04ee3b001f1" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">GT Racing is a Super Famicom racing video game where the player gets to drive a Gran Turismo car in either championship or practice mode.  The game is based on the 1996 Super GT racing season using the horsepower standards and rules of the era.  

During championship mode, the player is asked enter a number, his or her driver's name, and the team name that he or she will use during the championship. The driver's name and team can be entered using either English or Japanese letters. When a player beats a record, he or she is asked to insert his or her number, name or initials (up to four characters and two digits for the number). Championship mode can last for multiple seasons. Playing ninety-nine seasons in a single racing career is theoretically possible due to the double-digit nature of the season information. There are eight different tracks, including the Suzuka Circuit that has been shown in video games since Pole Position II and Fuji Speedway (complete with a virtually photorealistic Mount Fuji in the background).

Versus mode is for two human players only and the record options allows the players to look at his or her previous records. In a race, there are up to fifteen opponents to race against. The player gets rewarded with an opportunity to upgrade his or her equipment after a top five finish on any race course. Bonus equipment includes a faster engine, better tires, and a special dose of nitrous oxide created specifically for Gran Turismo vehicles. All of the bonus automobile parts are automatically installed in the appropriate parts for supercharging the vehicle. Once all the special parts are earned, the automobile is considered to be fully upgraded. The ultimate goal is to win the Gran Turismo championship for his or her team in addition for him/herself.

The &amp;quot;free practice&amp;quot; is essentially a time trial mode where the player races by him/herself for up to ten laps. Acquiring damage is still possible either crashing into walls or through normal wear and tear. The fastest lap time gets captured for the record book just like in the other modes of the game. Before being able to practice freely, the player can also choose the weather condition and the setup of his vehicle</resource>

It's distinct for being a Compati Hero game that wasn't developed by Winky Soft, but rather eventual Guilty Gear developers Arc System Works.

The goal of the game is to save the Earth from invading aliens. The humans of the world work together with the SD characters in three separate battle parties. The first character is SD Gundam's protagonist Knight Gundam and others become unlocked as the game continues.</resource>

The player directs a group of mech pilots, each riding distinctive bi-pedal suits and other vehicles. The game is structurally similar to Fire Emblem: the player moves all their units for their turn, either fighting enemy units or performing other tasks, and then control switches to the opponent. When two units meet in combat, a cutaway cutscene shows the aggressor landing (or missing) a hit, and the unit statistics underneath tell the player how much damage was caused.

The game was a Japanese exclusive. It was one of a handful of games to use the SNES Mouse peripheral.</resource>

Players launch missiles from the bottom of the screen at enemy spacecraft located at the top. The missile must pass through a asteroid belt flying across the screen and avoid the shots being fired from the spacecraft. The player controls the missile. Once launched it can be moved left and right and can be sped up by using the boost to speed it's way out of trouble. Points scored depend on the location of the hit on the enemy spacecraft. The speed at which enemy spacecraft moves increases as their numbers decrease.


 Once all spacecrafts have been destroyed another wave starts. The speed decreases again and the process repeats. A life is lost when a missile is hit by a shot or collides with an asteroid. There are 3 game modes. Black &amp; white and color recreate the graphics and behavior of the original arcade game, whilst Neo mode updates the game with improved graphics and slightly different behavior. There's also a turn-based two player mode. Other options include changing the number of lives available at the start of a game and the number of points needed for an extra ship.</resource>

It was released exclusively in Japan. The game features 3 different modes: Classic &amp;quot;Shanghai&amp;quot; Mahjong Solitaire, where the player can remove any two tiles as long as they match and both have a free horizontal side and aren't trapped with a piece on top; &amp;quot;Chinhai&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Sichuan&amp;quot; Mahjong Solitaire, where the player can only remove paired tiles if they can be connected with an invisible line that bends at a 90 degree angle two times or fewer. This mode features stacked tiles, unusual for games with this variant, but has the benefit of instantly removing any paired tiles that are touching;



 A unique block-pushing mode where the player has an avatar and must make their way to the exit of the board by pushing certain mahjong tiles. When a mahjong tile connects to another like it, both tiles vanish. If it connects to a different tile, it'll change to that tile. Some tiles cannot be pushed, and if a pushable tile connects to one, it too will be immovable and the player may end up trapped. They do not have to remove all the tiles on the board - the only goal is to reach the end. The game's story mode alternates through these three modes, and the player can also play any of the three modes directly from the main menu.</resource>

The two are frequent rivals, with Gamera often having to protect Japan from Gyaos's destructive sprees. The game was released to coincide with Gamera: Guardian of the Universe, a 1995 movie that reboots the mighty turtle kaiju and his origin story.In the game, both Gamera and Gyaos are presented as threats, and the player has to mobilize forces to repel the two kaiju away from populated areas in real-time strategy battles. The player has a base of operations on each map from which to deploy various units, from ground-based missile launchers and tanks to jet fighters. At any time, the player can switch from the top-down tactical view to an isometric perspective that displays the player's units and the kaiju in more detail.</resource>

This time around, a time-travelling machine threatens all of Japan and thus Goemon and co. must jump into the future to stop the machine.

The game alternates between a top-down world map view in which your characters explore the gameworld and side-scrolling stages in which the main action lies. As in most games of the series there are also loads of mini-games and unique gameplay sequences such as maneuvering Goemon's giant mecha.

The game continues the tradition of bizarre humor unique to the series, you can play as either Goemon or any of his 3 companions, Ebisumaru, Sasuke or Yae with each sporting unique weapons and abilities and also with their own dialogue options and cutscenes, which feature sitcom-like pre-recorded laughs for added wackiness.

The game takes the action to outer space as the gang attempts to rescue Goemon Impact (Goemon's giant mecha) from a strange planet. The game is based around a stage-select hub from which you select which character you want to play as and then attempt to clear the game's many side scrolling stages in standard action platformer fashion, navigating the obstacles and defeating all enemies you run into with your weapons.





 Since each one of Goemon's allies got stranded on a different planet, you must take control of each one of them in order to clear the stages and recover the special ability unique to each character that must be later put to use to release Goemon Impact. As in other games of the series there are also loads of mini-games and unique gameplay sequences triggered in boss fights, bonus stages and special situations. These involve shooter sequences, racing &amp; sport games and other assorted diversions.</resource>

Two meteors fell on Earth on a small island near North American Pacific Coast. In the middle of the island there is a small town governed by a sheriff. At first, the town's inhabitants didn't pay attention to the meteors. But then, strange things started happening. Monsters attacked people, and left on the victims' bodies a mysterious crest with one word: demiseed. One day you, a young boy who lives in the town, are contacted by two aliens who came in a miniature space ship. One of the aliens introduces himself as Zero, the Space Sheriff, and explains that an intergalactic criminal named Demi has escaped from justice and is hiding somewhere on the island, being the cause of all the troubles lately. Zero then possesses your body, lends you his powers, and commands you on the quest to destroy Demi and to bring peace to your island and to the alien world alike!

The game is an action/adventure with slight RPG elements (buying and upgrading weapons, etc.) set in Wild West. While featuring traditional dungeon-crawling and many enemies to dispose of in real time combat, the game doesn't equip you with standard medieval swords, but with pistols, shotgun, machine gun, and even a flamethrower. Your weapons have infinite ammo. You can duck to avoid the alien monsters' fire, and perform special attacks with various types of weapons.</resource>

Operation Desert Storm featured many different types of units including mobile armor. The M1 Abrams tank division is deployed in a variety of missions to destroy marked Iraqi targets.

Super Battletank: War in the Gulf is a 1st person tank simulation. Players sit in the cockpit to of a M1 Abrams tank. Controls allow the player to accelerate forward, decelerate, rotate the tank's trajectory left and right, move the tank's cannon left and right, fire the weapon and check the map. The goal of the player is to travel to the location of enemy targets, line them up with the Abrams cannon and fire upon them until destroyed. Each mission covers a large area of land and the player will need to consult the real-time map to travel appropriately to target locations. The M1 Abrams tank also features 2 special weapons: The laser which is more powerful than regular cannon, and the smoke screen which allows the player to escape.</resource>

Great King Tenma&amp;quot;) is a side-scrolling action game based on the GeGeGe no Kitarou license. Kitarou, a youkai boy and the last surviving member of the Ghost Tribe, is tasked with defeating the cocoon form of the dormant Great King Tenma before he can revive and destroy the world of humans.


Each stage is set up as a series of boss fights against notable youkai from the franchise. The player must learn their tactics and defeat them while preserving as much of their health as possible, as they will often have to fight several bosses in a row without being able to heal. There's also the occasional action sequence, such as a vaguely shoot 'em up part that leads to a tough fight against a colossal enemy.


The game was featured on the 13th season of the popular gaming Japanese TV show GameCenter CX.</resource>

Gekitotsu Dangan Jidousha Kessen: Battle Mobile plays similarly to Spyhunter in both perspective and objective, but your car in Battle Mobile isn't quite as high tech an instrument as that other game's vehicle. You can launch unlimited missiles, but they can only hit helicopters. For ground based targets you must dash into them to ram them off the road. Your car's health is constantly dwindling, even when you're not being attacked by enemies, so picking up the occasionally appearing energy refill items is essential. Shields can be picked up and stored that will make your car invulnerable to all damage for a short while.</resource>

The mega-corporation CONEX has been spearheading the rebuilding process, but their true intentions are far from altruistic. By gobbling up their competition, and with the help of new weapons technology, CONEX is on the cusp of controlling the world. Only a hero from the last war can defy them and stop their plans of conquest.

Genocide 2 is a modified version of the PC release. The player takes control of a ten meter tall robotic ninja: the Tracer. Its only form of attack is a sword, but it can hold several extra weapons, and always has access to the Betty. The Betty can be fired in eight directions, returns to the Tracer after being fired, and can block enemy bullets. The objective of each stage is to reach the end, and some stages require you to destroy targets along the way. Any items picked up by the player, or damage done to the Tracer, carries over between stages, and each stage records your fastest time for beating them.

Aside from the visual downgrade, Genocide 2 also lost many minor enemy types and one mid-boss in the transition to the Super Famicom. The first stage was removed, and the first two levels of stage 2 were reversed. The Betty now can only be used for a limited time, and must recharge when its time has run out.</resource>

Played from an third-person perspective using a view from right over the shoulders over the boxer, players can move left and right to dodge incoming punches, block and throw left and right punches. The standard punch is a cross, but by holding the Up-key pressed, jabs can also be thrown.

By avoiding punches and hitting them, a superpunch often becomes available, inflicting much more damage. A fight consists of a maximum of three rounds of three minutes each. When a boxer is knocked down four times, the match is over (technical knock-out). The same happens when a boxer goes down three times in a single round (regular knock-out). When down, players need to press both punch buttons in rapid succession to get back to their feet. The screen shows an energy meter drained when punches are received. After being knocked down and during intermissions, some energy is restored.

All versions, except for the Game Boy, can be played with two players. A password system is used to save the progress.

    <resource id="40ef3af417df9668daa37402df473c8dbb5d7757" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Ghost Chaser Densei doesn't take any dramatic departures from the standard scrolling-brawler plot-line. A city twenty minutes in the future must be saved from a terrorist organization, and between salvation and you is a long, straight line full of goons who must be punched. Aside from receiving orders from your boss before each level, and the quick conversation with a boss or rare NPC, the story won't attempt to get in the way of beat-downs.

There are three playable characters in Ghost Chaser Densei: the martial artist Makai, the mace wielding cat-girl Iyo, and the autonomous robot Belva. Each has unique moves as well as the basic abilities of attacking, jumping, blocking, throwing, and using a special if attack and jump are pressed together. Unlike most brawlers these special moves deplete a recharging special bar, not your health. Makai can throw fireballs and do a flying kick in midair, Iyo can triangle jump and preform a spinning piledriver, and Belva can double jump and preform a grapple special. Characters also have a team up special if playing in two player mode. Enemies range from armored soldiers to lizard men to robots, but most break down into the same hierarchy: weaker types will rush at you while stronger types will shoot projectiles then rush at you. Each level ends with a unique boss with multiple short and long range attacks.</resource>

It features multiple pachinko tables, some of which are based on those manufactured by game publishers Sammy Corporation while others are credited to Heiwa and Sankyo: fellow manufacturers of actual pachinko machines.

The game features a number of modes, including a tutorial mode that reveals how best to play the virtual tables and their real-life equivalents - often a draw for fans of the real thing in simulators such as this - and a story mode where a living pachinko ball tries to win a fortune, similar to the premise of Coconuts Japan's Pachio-kun series.</resource>

It is, however, the first and only game of the series to be released on the Super Famicom. The anime/manga series is known for its massive fleet-based skirmishes, its profuse amount of classical music and the Death Note-esque tactical rivalry between the two protagonists, Reinhard and Yang Wen-li: two military geniuses on either side of a centuries-old conflict.The SNES version is far more like a simulation than most games of this type, with players directing their fleet and combat from a computer console. The goal is effective macro-level management of the large number of ships under the player's command, rather than focusing on any one ship and its encounters.</resource>

Angel, a subsidiary of Bandai, procured the license to produce a video game adaptation.The story concerns a galactic war that is presented similarly to the Japanese Sengoku (or Warring States) period of the 16th century, with various larger-than-life warlords competing for territory with the intent to unite the entire Milky Way under their rule.The game has the player select one of four major characters from the anime, each of which has a different starting location and resources to work from. The player gives orders for the planets and ships in their control. Instead of turns, every side moves their units simultaneously in real-time.</resource>

The angel Tenshi has taken it upon himself to put an end to Ackman's nefarious ways, and sends an army of angels and hired assassins to take out Ackman for good. It's just as well, because Ackman was getting bored without anyone to kill.

Go Go Ackman is a scrolling platformer starring the titular Ackman. Ackman can punch and charge up a ranged wave of energy, and he can also jump on some enemies to stun them before running into them and turning them into a sliding projectile. Ackman can hold up to three bombs that can clear the screen of enemies, and can also hold a weapon, either a sword, boomerang, or pistol, but it will be lost if Ackman is hit. Levels are linear, but do allow some exploration to find weapons and items hidden off the beaten road.</resource>

Each weapon can be upgraded twice, but upgrades will be lost if Ackman is hit or finds a new weapon. Ackman can also now throw smaller enemies, although he can't move while holding them.

Who's really pulling the strings here? And, most importantly, does Ackman care about any of this at all?

The last of the Ackman games, Go Go Ackman 3 makes very few changes from Go Go Ackman 2, although Tenshi is now a playable character. Both Ackman and Tenshi can be switched between at special points in a level, but they share the same health meter and weapon. Unlike Ackman Tenshi can fly, but as he is an angel he can not collect the souls of enemies he kills. Souls have changed too, and are now used as currency in shops where Ackman can buy temporary powerups or healing. Finally Ackman has lost the ability to slide enemies along the ground, but he can now move while holding a stunned enemy.</resource>

It was also brought out by an obscure publisher, making it largely unknown in the West. However, it has a small following in its country of origin, thanks to the character designs provided by Masumi Sudou ( ). She is especially famous for her cute manga stories which deal with everyday stories of cats or fairytale-ish settings. Gokinjo Boukentai has a present-day setting and is thus often compared to Mother 2 / Earthbound. Getting a fairly small release by Pioneer DLC back in the late 16-bit days, the game is one of the very few RPGs which actually fetches high prices on the Japanese retro game market.</resource>

    <resource id="deaab3cf17d7cd5ba70033317aed5433888f7310" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Konami's Gradius and space-shooter parody series continues with this second installment.  Gameplay is similar to the Gradius series in that you control a ship that can move anywhere on the screen while the screen itself scrolls from left to right. Enemies appear in waves and destroying all the fighters in a single wave releases power-ups which may be used to choose your ships upgrade. The Upgrade bar too is lifted from Gradius, however each character has different names and functions for their upgrades.

In Gokujyou Parodius, you are now able to now choose from 11 different characters... many of whom appear from other Konami games. They include:

1. Vic Viper: a ship from Gradius

2. Takosuke: the &amp;quot;octopus&amp;quot; of the previous Parodius game, and also seen in at least one Goemon

3. Twinbee: making his appearance from the Twinbee side scrolling games, Twinbee is a squat round robot with a jetpack and a disproportionately big punching glove

4. Pentaro: the original &amp;quot;joke character&amp;quot;, Pentaro made an appearence in a previous Gradius title as a flying penguin. However he does star in his own games as well, Konami's Penguin Adventure

5. Hikaru: Hikaru is a girl in a tight fighting &amp;quot;bunny suit&amp;quot; who is riding on top of a missile

6. Mambo: Mambo is a strange looking fish with two horns on the top of his head and on his underside

7. Michael: some kind of fat angel pig. He has wings and a golden halo over his head

8. Koitsu: A blue stick man riding on a surfboard. He's probably one of the more 'normal' characters

9. Goemon: star of the Goemon series of games. Goemon is a ninja warrior equipped with wooden pipes. He flies around in a superman pose for his appearance in Parodius

10. Dracula: star of Konami's Kid Dracula, this white haired squat character retains his vampiric abilities including that of being able to change into a bat

11. Upa: a flying baby. Upa is actually from a Konami game by the name of  Bokutte Upa but is probably just more recognizable as &amp;quot;the flying baby&amp;quot; of this crazy shooter

In addition to your player-character, the levels themselves will be full of a strange mix of Konami references, bright colors and the just plain zany. it's not uncommon to have to fly your ship underneath a woman's legs for example or chased by a giant walrus or having enemies shooting cute pink hearts at you.</resource>

The game is an adaptation of the manga series Gon by Masashi Tanaka, about the daily life of a super-deformed orange carnosaur named Gon.

Like the manga, the video game features a minimal plot and no dialogue. Instead it focuses on the cartoonish, comedic situations Gon gets himself into, particularly when searching for food and interacting with other animals. Gon would venture into different ecosystems that made up the prehistoric world.</resource>

The combat in the game is turn-based, and the enemies you encounter are random. Enemies attack from several sides, also from above, and you must often fight at several front simultaneously.</resource>

The game is based around an alien invasion during a festival, and the four heroes (Ultraman, Kamen Rider, Knight Gundam from Gundam and Fighter Roar, a character created for The Great Battle series).

The game has a mix of genres. The chief gameplay is a platformer where the player can leap up and down floors similar to Ninja-Kid or Mr. Goemon. If the player enters a flying gate, they are escorted to a shoot 'em up stage in which they control a flying lobster fighting samurai heads and Maneki Nekos.

The Great Battle Gaiden 2 follows the Game Boy game Tekkyu Fight! The Great Battle Gaiden, released the previous year. Like every The Great Battle game and its Japanese pop culture-specific heroes, the game was never localized into English.</resource>

The player controls a magnifying glass and must click on various items for different effects. Finding a clock adds more time to the search, clicking on a 150 icon adds 150 points to the score, etc.

Each picture consists of 6 adjacent screens containing a continuous theme. The themes are The Carpet Flyers, The Underground Hunters, The Battling Monks, The Unfriendly Giants and The Land of Waldos. Players are given the option of playing on Normal difficulty, Expert difficulty, or playing the Land of Waldos stage. The only difference between the difficulties is that on expert there are no clock items to provide players with extra time.

In all of the stages the player must find both Waldo and a scroll to complete the stage. Waldo must be found before the scroll in order to complete the stage. Waldo's dog Woof is also in each of these stages (except for the Land of Waldos) and by finding him players get to play a small bonus stage where they collect points as they control the dog on a flying carpet.</resource>

Gameplay consists of moving forward and blasting all the enemies who get in the way. The player starts out with a normal gun, but can find other weapons throughout a level, such as a flamethrower or a laser gun. While the normal gun has an infinite amount of bullets, the other types of weapons will eventually run out of ammo. With these weapons, the player can shoot either straight, up, or on a diagonal. The player will also have the opportunity to commandeer a vehicle, which they can also fire bullets from.

The player starts with 5 lives and 3 continues. Each of the stages must be defeated in a certain amount of time or the player loses one of those lives.</resource>

The game presents players with an opportunity to test their shogi wits against a CPU opponent, but also demonstrates matches played and commentated by a cartoon avatar of Habu himself, describing the tactics he used.

Yoshiharu Habu would later appear in other shogi games, such as Saikyou Habu Shogi for the Nintendo 64 and Habu Yoshiharu Shogi de Kitaeru: Ketsudanryoku DS for the Nintendo DS.</resource>

When the Koma clan attacks and steals the Holy Grail, only one ninja survives. Transformed into a cyborg, it is his task to retrieve the Holy Grail and save the world.

Hagane is an action-oriented platformer, featuring five stages, divided into several sub-stages, filled with lots of enemies, jumping puzzles, mid- and endbosses. The titular main character can perform double jumps, jump off walls, use four different weapons,  slide over the ground, somersault to dodge attacks and use several different special attacks.

Weapons include: a short sword, a chain, small bombs and throwing knives. Bombs and knives have limited ammunition that can be restored by picking up the right items dropped by defeated enemies.

Pressing and holding the shoulder buttons will cause Hagane to somersault and jump across the screen. This movement goes through three phases, pressing the jump or attack button during any of these phases lets Hagane perform different special attacks, such as flaming punches, kicks or backflips.

His music can cover enemies in fear, or even control their minds. Hamel and his mascot Oboe arrives at Staccato, a small town attacked by monsters, and drives them away with his power. Impressed, a cute little girl named Flute decides to go with Hamel in order to find and destroy the evil power behind the attacks.

The game is typical platform. You play as Hamel, and with your violin can shoot musical notes to beat your enemies. However, you count with Flute’s aid. Flute follows you (although you can order her to stop and stay), but also can be grabbed and thrown at the enemies (yes, thrown at the enemies). Flute can also collect through all the stages some costumes that, when worn, give her special abilities, such as flying, leaping, breaking walls or even explode and kill all in screen. At the end of each stage, of course, you’ll find the typical boss, all named as musical instruments.

The Exhibition mode allows up to four different players to compete either against each other in singles match or in tag team format.  Champion League Match is a round robin-type tournament with six different wrestlers competing for the league championship.  Tournament is the standard tournament format with eight different wrestlers involved and Top Ranking Match where the player must battle through the other eleven wrestlers and defeat each one to become champion.

The game is divided into three different screens at times.  The middle part shows the current action happening in the ring while the top and bottom parts of the screen are used for close-ups of action sequences such as power moves, illegal moves and finishing maneuvers.</resource>

The protagonist Keiji Maeda wanders around the countryside of Edo period Japan and gets into fights with various villains and other warriors. The player controls Keiji's actions by selecting decisions off a menu similar to adventure games of the era. When in combat, the game switches to a one-on-one fighter. The player's previous decisions can sometimes give them a bonus or malus going into these fights. The game follows the story of the manga, starting at the same point the manga does. It was released exclusively for the Super Famicom in November 1994.</resource>

You take the role of the commander of the Hanjuku army, and your goal is to guide it successfully through a series of events (called &amp;quot;tales&amp;quot;), capturing enemy castles and defeating the bosses of the Kanjuku army. 

This is a real-time war strategy game. The game time is divided into months, each month taking a few minutes of real time. You control the hero and his generals, each one commanding units of foot soldiers. You send your army commanders through the world map to capture enemy castles. Once all the castles are captured, a new construction appears on the map, where the level boss resides, and your final goal in the chapter (tale) is to defeat this boss. Once you run into an enemy, an automatic battle sequence occurs, which you can interrupt, assigning commands to your army. Both Hanjuku and Kanjuku armies can summon powerful creatures called Egg Monsters, who can fight against a whole army or against each other in turn-based combat. Each month a &amp;quot;monthly event&amp;quot; occurs, such as changes in the land, earthquake, etc. Random events also pop out, during which you can buy supplies for your army.</resource>

The story of the game is simple: you are Adyu, an apprentice knight who spends all his time training. One day, a mysterious old man appears out of nowhere, approaches Adyu and tells him the world needs more paladins, and therefore you must train harder in order to become one. He sends you on a quest to find a legendary weapon, which is broken into twelve parts, each part being hidden in a different place. He also entrusts you with the power of Ryu, a huge magical armor that grants the hero who equips it immense power. This is where Adyu's journey begins!

The game is an action RPG, somewhat similar to  Ys series. Adyu wanders through the world and fights enemies in real-time combat, using melee weapons. He can also jump to avoid enemy attacks. You gain experience after defeating monsters and advance in levels. You can summon the armor Ryu at any time, which makes you much stronger, but you can't go through narrow corridors and climb up stairs when in Ryu form. The game features mostly open areas populated by enemies with an occasional town thrown in. The structure of the game is non-linear: you can visit almost any area of the map at any time.

The player must race across a course hitting three checkpoints before returning to the starting line to move onto the next lap. The courses all have different layouts and the player must use the D-pad to turn their character mid-sprint, often causing them to veer strongly from one side to the other. In the single-player the player, as Hebereke, has to challenge every other character on their respective courses. Characters have distinctive strengths and weaknesses that the player needs to ascertain in order to defeat them.

Players can also acquire items that can help them out by running over certain spots on the course, similar to Super Mario Kart, and can collect multiple items and switch between them. The game also includes a tag mode and bonus rounds that involve getting chased in a circle by a giant boulder.</resource>

The game operates like a standard turn-based RPG outside of combat - the player moves around the overworld map, talks to NPCs in town, characters can level up and change their equipment. In combat, the player can move their characters around on a grid to confront enemy forces, in an order determined by statistics. This mode includes elements of Fire Emblem, such as the risk of permanently losing allied characters if they're allowed to fall in battle.</resource>

On his way to the demon land he met three animals: a dog, a monkey, and a pheasant, who helped him on his quest. The second game is split into two parts: the first tells the story of the pheasant Ohana and the princess Otohime, while the second tells about the ultimate battle of the heroes against the evil.

The game is an adventure in which you interact with the environments by selecting commands from a menu. As a pheasant, you can also fly from location to location. There are several times sequences when you must act quickly in order to make the game progress.

    <resource id="01817fbccf4d0ab86cf800a93bc7341a57674467" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">This is an adventure game based on the old Japanese fairy tale about Momotaro, a boy who was found by an old couple inside of a huge peach (hence the name Momotaro - &amp;quot;Peach Guy&amp;quot;). Momotaro grows up and embarks on a journey to rid the land of the vicious tribe of ogres, and to take their treasures. On his way he meets three animals - a dog, a monkey, and a pheasant, who help him to defeat the ogres. This game is the first part of the story, and is divided into two large chapters, the first telling the story of the dog Ringo, the second the story of the monkey Matsunosuke. 

In this adventure, you interact with the world by selecting various commands from a menu. Along with traditional commands such as &amp;quot;Look&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Take&amp;quot; there are situation-specific commands, for example &amp;quot;Smell&amp;quot; for the dog. In certain places it is possible to move by navigating the character physically.

It plays like a traditional top-down Japanese RPG, where the player can form a party, meet NPCs and fight creatures in turn-based battles in a separate view mode that emphasizes the monster models.

The game is specifically based on a fantastical reimagining of the Yamato Takeru story that was the basis of a kaiju movie in 1994, released in the US as Orochi: The Eight-Headed Dragon. The movie's producers, Toho Company, also published this game. They hired Multimedia Intelligence Transfer to develop the game, the company best known for creating Shin Megami Tensei spin-offs for Atlus.

After a confusing incident that causes Prince Ousu to kill his older brother after the latter briefly flies into an uncontrollable rage, the Prince is sent away by his father - the Emperor - to rein in his destructive powers and redeem himself by taking down the barbarians living in the Kumaso region. In addition to this task, Prince Ousu has to face the Yamata no Orochi dragon, the Kumaso barbarians' god Kumasogami and the antagonistic deity Tsukuyomi with the help of companions Susano-o and Ototachibana.</resource>

The game was developed originally for the PC-9801 computer in 1992 and was then ported to the Super Famicom in 1994.The story concerns the young Crown Prince Richard A. McIntyre (who would eventually be known as the Scarlet King) who is chased from his home by demons. He meets a dryad spirit who bestows to him the ability to summon and control monsters and other creatures, and Prince Richard uses this power to raise an army to take back his castle.The Super Famicom is one of a handful to use the SNES Mouse peripheral as many of its mechanics depend on mouse control.</resource>

Having more in common with Midway's Arch Rivals than any sane hockey simulation, this arena is no place for penalties, and no place for wimps. While the idea is still to somehow put the puck into the opposing team's goal, each team only has three players, there is a heavy focus on checking, and it is possible to do a &amp;quot;super shot&amp;quot; which is strong enough to send the goalie into the net along with the puck.

Available are exhibition and tournament modes for one or two players. Two players can even team up to take on the computer. The TurboGrafx-16 release also adds a four-player mode, while the Gameboy version adds a &amp;quot;shot race&amp;quot; mode where the player must get a certain number of goals as quickly as possible.</resource>

The background story is based on the manga/animé of the same name. The years is 199X, and the world lies in ruins. Technology can no longer be used, and the land is controlled by fighters of rivaling styles. In this game, you can choose one of the fighter characters of the series: the main hero Kenshiro, his brother and rival Raou, Nanto Seiken fighters Rei and Souther, the assassin Heart, and others. You fight one-on-one, filling an energy bar and performing various attacks and techniques. There is a free fight mode where you choose your opponent yourself, and a two-player mode.

It is based on the main storyline of the manga/animé series Hokuto no Ken, also known as Fist of the North Star. 

After a terrible disaster mankind has stopped advancing the technology, and the world became a huge wasteland, controlled by fighter organizations. The main hero, Kenshirou of the Hokuto Shinken school, falls in love with a girl named Julia, who is abducted by one of the Nanto Seiken fighters, Shin. 

In the game, the player can choose to fight as various characters from the series, including Kenshirou, his brother Raou, the Emperor Souther, the leader of Nanto Seiken Rei, and others. There are three modes in the game: story mode, battle mode, and free fight mode.

1. In story mode, the player fights as Kenshirou in pre-determined battles that reflect the story of the series (like facing the assassin Heart). 
In battle mode, the player participates in a tournament by choosing one of the characters. 
In free fight mode, the player choses characters as well as the opponents. During battles, the player must first accumulate energy in order to unleash devastating techniques unique to each character.

One day, the sky suddenly turns dark blue, a heavy rain falls onto the city, and the boy finds, halfway between his house and the school, an umbrella which seems to have fallen from the sky. What he does not know is that the umbrella is magical! The moment he touches it, he is transfered to a parallel universe. Immediately, he is attacked by a huge tank, but a strange old man with a talking bird saves him. It seems that an evil creature named Dondera is threatening the country with the terrible monsters she created. But is it really so? You visit the capital town, talk to the emperor, and decide to investigate the matter...

&amp;quot;Holy Umbrella&amp;quot; is essentially a platform action game, but unlike most other games of this genre, it allows you to visit towns, where you control your hero in a standard RPG-like top-down fashion. You can enter houses, talk to townspeople, etc. On platform levels, which are the main part of the game, you have to switch between the hero, the talking bird Bonto who accompanies you on your quest, and the girl Saki, whom you meet later in the game. Every character has his/her own special abilities and own ways of fighting: the hero can slide through air by using the umbrella, Bonto can double-jump on high ledges, Saki can jump on walls, etc. You use your umbrella as a weapon, as well as elemental stones you can collect on your way and throw at enemies. You also find various power-ups and items you can equip on the hero.</resource>

It was designed by the Japanese game journalist Kowloon Kurosawa, who said the game was made in two days. The game has gained a cult following in Japan and Taiwan for its notoriously poor quality, considered to be a kusoge. The game is set around the transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong in 1997. People from the Chinese Mainland started immigrating to Hong Kong and greatly increased the crime rate. As a countermeasure, Chin (Jackie Chan in his Wheels on Meals appearance), an unspecified relative of Bruce Lee, was hired by the Hong Kong government (represented by Chris Patten) to wipe out all 1.2 billion people in China. But meanwhile, in China, research was underway to bring the dead Tong Shau Ping (Deng Xiaoping) back to life as the &amp;quot;ultimate weapon&amp;quot;. When the game was released in 1995, Deng Xiaoping, said to be dead in the game, was still alive. However, he did die months before the handover in 1997, which is when the game's plot actually takes place</resource>

The game features a story mode and many different characters, with distinctive anime avatars.

Honkaku Mahjong: Tetsuman was followed up by both a sequel (Honkaku Mahjong: Tetsuman II, released the following year) and a reprint. The reprint was released in 1997, towards the end of the Super Nintendo's lifespan.</resource>

Tinker Bell takes Peter back to Neverland where he must again become Pan and reclaim his children.

This particular interpretation is a side-scrolling action game, in which players must hack their way past Hook's denizens through 11 levels.  These include forests, icy regions, and towns which Peter will have to jump, climb, and swim through. Magic items such as apples and pixie dust can be collected for special powers. When enemies are attacked, they simply put their hands up in surrender rather than dying, so as to make the game more child-friendly.</resource>

Each level in the game will have a given task to help in this, and you are allotted a number of characters who must accomplish the task. The player can switch from person to person while moving the characters around each scrolling puzzle, and teamwork is essential to success.  

Tasks can include finding objects (like a spear) on the screen, or trying to reach a specific destination which may require the use of objects you have discovered so far. Each level has a time limit, when time runs out the level can be restarted.

In each turn, one player gets to lay an egg into one grid of the 9x9 playfield. When a player manages to trap a row (horizontally, vertically or diagonally) of an opponent's eggs, i.e. having an one egg at each end of the row, they change colour. A round is over after a certain amount of time and whoever has the most eggs on the field, wins. One match consists of several rounds. In contrast to the real board game, up to four player can participate.</resource>

This war machine has been named the Red October. While on its trial run, the captain, Marko Ramius has hijacked the submarine along with it's crew. They plan to defect to the United States. Naturally, such a weapon must not be allowed to fall into American plans, and so orders are issued among the Soviet forces to destroy the Red October. 

You control the Red October during its run for freedom. The game plays as an underwater sidescroller. The Red October submarine can move in any of four directions. The A button fires torpedoes horizontally towards the right and the B button fires missiles vertically, upwards. Additionally, the Caterpillar drive (invisibility) may be activated for short periods of time. The player may also activate a ECM blast that will destroy all nearby offensive weapons. On the screen at all times are displays for Armor (health) and Power (fuel); should either run low, the Red October in danger of being destroyed. Power-Ups to increase or decrease the power of missiles and torpedoes may be found by destroying enemies.</resource>

    <resource id="675ea7ca4fbdb700733082ab5de807ca58d3ba6b" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Featuring in a children's TV cartoon, The Hurricanes are the most revered team in the World Soccer League. The Gorgons are desperate to beat them in a key match - so desperate that they have made it hard for the team to even get to the stadium. Taking control of one of their star players, you must trek through the jungle, mines and a temple to get them to the stadium on time.

Soccer Kid seems like a logical game to 'influence' a license of a show about brilliant football players. Arc Developments agreed. The gameplay thus has a football used as a weapon against encroaching foes. There are ropes to move across, precise jumps to time, and traps to avoid.

In The Hurricanes the ball sticks closely to the player's foot, even while he is jumping. It is only released when purposefully kicked, and replaced if it hits something or is lost. It can be flicked up while you are off the ground.

The levels move from left to right but on several different vertical levels, and there is often more than 1 possible path, in a manner similar to Global Gladiators. Power-up tokens can be collected and traded in. Losing one of your 5 lives takes you back tot he last restart point - losing one of your continues takes you to the start of the world.</resource>

The player can choose between three different leagues: Men's League, Woman's League and Hyper League, which is a league for robots. Two buttons are used to control the ball, one for normal actions and one for &amp;quot;Hyper Plays&amp;quot;, special attacks that can only be learned and used in the Hyper League. How a player will block or attack depends on the ball's speed and the players position. Team members who aren't under the player's direct control will also act on their own by positioning themselves or preparing spikes. They will, however, not block spikes on their own but it is possible to let players not under direct control block spikes by pressing one of the action buttons at the right moment.</resource>

The manga artist Koji Aihara penned the story and worked on the character design. The protagonist is a player-named boy who escapes from a laboratory after awakening to his psychokinetic powers. His quest takes him across a dystopian world, picking up allies along the way.

The game has a few novel ideas, like allowing the protagonist to crossdress (which changes their profile picture) or wear underwear on his head, the latter of which results in people treating him like a pervert, which has a few beneficial side-effects. The protagonist has a &amp;quot;limit break&amp;quot; style attack when low on health, and the game has a day/night cycle.

Koji Aihara also worked on the 1992 JRPG Maka Maka (also by Office Koukan). His satirical and bizarre touches permeate Idea no Hi as well.</resource>

Before each mission, the player can look at a map and learn of trapped victims and dangerous hot spots and choose their equipment that include a chemical &amp; electrical fire extinguisher, an oxygen tank, a rope and an axe among others.  However, the more equipment that the player is carrying, they will not be able to run or kick, limiting the firefighter to just merely walking.

The goal of each mission is the same, traverse the building while avoiding fires or extinguishing them, save victims and keep from being burned.  Along the way the fire fighters will encounter obstacles that will stop or kill the player including collapsing floors and explosive barrels.  There are no power-ups to replenish their health or fire extinguishers so the player must be cautious.  Points are awarded after each stage for saving victims, the time left on the meter as well as &amp;quot;Event&amp;quot; points.  If the player receives a certain amount of points at the end of the game, they will be treated to a special bonus stage.</resource>

(Mean And Dirty) agents.  This time it's personal because Doctor Claw has captured Gadget's niece, Penny.  With the help of his trusty dog, Brain, and his suit full of special gadgets, Inspector Gadget must save Penny and defeat Doctor Claw and his minions!

Gadget will start in a haunted castle in England, and from there, he will travel to many places around the world while pursuing Doctor Claw. On the way, he will be confronted by Doctor Claw's agents, and the only way to get by them is to use his gadgets and items against them.

Gadget can attack his enemies by using his punch (up, left right) and kicks which he is already equipped with.  

Several items he picked up can be used as weapons: 

Bombs - throw at enemies

Red Propellers - to be used against aerial enemies 

Offensive Arrow - shoot at enemies 

Little Inspector Gadgets - little robots that will run at and damage enemies.

If Gadget gets hit, he will lose his overcoat, leaving him in his boxers! In this state, he will lose a life if he gets hit again.  To prevent this from happening, pick up an extra overcoat that he can change into.

Other items include: 

Hands - comes up from Gadget's hat and will grasp onto rings

Suction cups - shoot at walls and have Gadget climb up them

Hats - used as energy source for certain gadgets

The World Cup tournament is featured in full, and you can adjust which 24 teams this features, a particularly crucial feature for English and French fans, as their nations failed to qualify. For the first time in the series an on-screen referee is featured. The club team data has been updated to take into account transfers and kit changes since the previous version. Gameplay is much the same as previous editions, being viewed from above with small sprites and loose ball control.

The B-movie story is cheesy and does nothing more than accommodate for the action. From the introduction sequence: &amp;quot;The peril came from outer space. A meteorite entered the earth's atmosphere bringing chaos. After observation, the scientists found that the meteorite was radioactive and had to be destroyed. Unfortunately, terrorists from g.h.o.s.t. want the meteorite too. The Iron Commando's mission is to retrieve the deadly body and avoid genetic mutation.&amp;quot;

The player or players walk along the levels beating up enemies. On some levels you ride a motorcycle or jeep, even a mine kart, and shoot your way through hordes of enemies. There are several end bosses, some are screen filling like a helicopter and a giant robot.

Some enemies will drop food, grenades or weapons as you beat them into a bloody pulp. There are lots of different Weapons: 9mm guns, shotguns, machine guns, knives, baseball bats. The weird thing is, enemies that use a sword and even dogs will occasionally drop a machine gun or baseball bat.

The game operates like a junior version of Super Okuman Chouja Game. Instead of the players making purchases and sales completely on their own, the game offers advice for important situations.



 There are many themes including modern, futuristic, and the map of the world. Players that are controlled by the game's artificial intelligence range from teenagers to senior citizens. Players can move from 1 to 9 squares and must allow collect symbols from playing cards in order to get money from the bank. Casino gambling is also available and it includes Bingo and slot machines. Like in Tower Dream, the game instantly ends if the only human player gets bankrupt in a game involving 3 AI-controlled players and 1 human-controlled player.</resource>

Itchy &amp; Scratchy is a single player platform side-scroller. The player controls Itchy, the mouse, and must defeat Scratchy, the cat, with a variety of weapons. Itchy caries a default mallet, but can pick up additional weapons on particular levels. Each of the seven levels takes place in a different fictional location and is designed as a maze of doors and platforms. After defeating Scratchy, he usually will return with a special contraption to attack Itchy, and must therefore be defeated again.</resource>

The game is a realistic angling simulator, with accurate fishing rod physics and cutaways of digitized photos for NPCs, though it does also include anthromorphic characters as other anglers. The player can take part in the story mode, which sets goals for the player to accomplish as part of the BAC (Bass Angler's Club), or a free-fishing mode that lets the player customize various options beforehand like the time of day, the weather, or the season. Depending on these factors, fishing at different parts of the lake will produce different results.

The game was designed by Mother/EarthBound creator Shigesato Itoi, who also lends his name to the game. As well as a 2000 N64 port which was dubbed the &amp;quot;Definitive Edition&amp;quot;, the game was also available on the Super Famicom's Satellaview service in eight distinct episodes. This version of the game was also used in nationwide competitions for the best fishing haul.</resource>

As the name suggests, Izzy must find the five Olympic rings, hidden by the guardians so that Izzy does not take them to his world.

The game plays a lot like Mario games; to eliminate an opponent Izzy must jump over his head. There are two jumps available, the ball jump suitable for height and the hurdle jump, suitable for distance. Both allow Izzy to clear an enemy, but the second harms  him.If Izzy is hit, then he must find three medals, or at the next hit he loses a life. There are some extra objects, like Olympic torches, and eggs that hatch either objects for bonus points, trampolines or  morph points to reach otherwise inaccessible areas or traps. Izzy can also morph into a glider, a baseball player, an archer or a rocket, among others, to overcome some sections of the levels.

Graphics and sound remain faithful to the cartoony origins of the mascot.</resource>

The game includes options for up to four players using the multitap.</resource>

As with the other games in the series, the pitch is depicted horizontally with the camera focused on the ball in the center. It features an Exhibition mode, a League mode and a Tournament mode. It also includes two practice modes and a separate penalty shootout mode. Up to four players can play the game, taking on different combinations of control over the two teams: 1 vs. CPU, 1 vs. 1, 2 vs. CPU, 1 vs. 2 and 2 vs. 2. Publisher Epoch also incorporated some Barcode Battler compatibility, a common feature for their Super Famicom games produced in the mid-90s.

The game features every team in the 1995 season of J-League, which increased from 12 to 14 teams since the previous season.</resource>

The game offers different modes of play (tournaments, championships ...) although unfortunately only the few Japanese teams of the J League are available. It is possible to adjust the referee's severity and climatic conditions. It is the third of A-Max's Excite Stage games to be released on the Super Famicom, and also the last. However, the series would persist on the Nintendo Game Boy Color and Sony PlayStation. The game focuses on the 1996 season of the J-League with its sixteen teams, with options to recreate the league or play exhibition matches or tournaments with any of the sixteen. Like its predecessors, the game uses a horizontal perspective of the pitch that is slightly angled to make it easier to determine the distance between players. It creates this effect through the Super Famicom's Mode 7 scaling technology.</resource>

Prime Goal 2 was released on August 5, 1994 only in Japan for the Super Famicom.

Other than running around, shooting, passing, and slide-tackling, the player has control over several other actions. Naturally, there are throw ins (the player can select which team member to throw the ball to), goal kicks (where the player controls the distance the ball is kicked), fouls (referees even dole out yellow and red cards), and occasionally a one-on-one minigame. In this one-on-one game the player can either manage to relinquish control of the ball from the opponent, or have the opponent jump over the player (depending on the player's button inputs).

Of note are the variety of modes that are offered in Prime Goal 2. Naturally, there is a player vs. computer and player vs. player mode, but also included are a campaign mode (complete with a password system), a penalty kick mode, and an &amp;quot;east vs. west&amp;quot; mode where the player is able to consolidate members from several teams into one, customized team.</resource>

Though the title suggests there should be more volumes, as far as I know the other two where never produced.

In this game you play Frodo Baggins, a Hobbit. The game starts off at Bilbo's 111 birthday. Your first quest is to find Pippin. In your quest you will need to take the Ring to Rivendell. You start alone, but later on you will get others to join you in your quest, like Sam and Gandalf.

The game was originally designed for the NES, but release was hold off and later on adapted for the SNES. Because of the original game design graphics are somewhat NES like and not all buttons of the controller are used. The cartridge does not contain any RAM/battery, games can only be saved by remembering a code. The code must later be entered into the game to continue.

The game actually begins in Tripoli, Libya and passes through around 2,500 miles of African desert, swamp and jungle on the way to Dakar.Jaleco originally developed the game for the Arcades before porting it to the Super Famicom. This home version was never released outside of Japan. The game was also ported to the Amiga and Atari ST, where it is known simply as Big Run.GameplayIn addition to passing each checkpoint under the required time - the checkpoint system ubiquitous in solo racing games of the era - the player must also be aware of environmental dangers along the course and needs to select a sponsor, navigator and engineer team before starting. They must also balance the weight of their car, as too few replacement parts might cause a problem further into the race yet having too many will greatly reduce the car's top speed.</resource>

Most events had some sort of twist to them, to make them fit the underwater theme, or the style of humour seen in the James Pond series. The 100-metre-splash is similar to joystick-waggling games of the 80s but also involves making timed jumps to hit seagulls. More unusual is Kipper Watching, which involves 'heading' incoming beach balls away from a troop of sleeping seals. There's also gymnastics, unicycle-riding, and a hurdles race of sorts. The events can be played by up to 4 players.

It was exclusive to the Super Famicom.

The game features a story mode with increasingly difficult opponents - it also has a tutorial for its obtuse mechanics - as well as a free mode where the player tries to survive as long as possible and a versus mode for multiple human players. In the single-player modes, the player can choose between a male or female avatar.

The goal of the game is take a pair of falling dice, each with a specific color and number attached to them, and drop them into a grid with other fallen dice. If a die is on a line horizontally, vertically or diagonally with another die of the same color, both those dice and every die in-between will drop by one in value. Once a die has reached &amp;quot;1&amp;quot; and is involved in another combo, it disappears. Dice on top fall in the gaps left behind, potentially creating chain reactions. There are also power-ups that will either help the player out or create problems for the opponent. The game ends once the dice stack to the top of the screen.</resource>

He travels throughout such landscapes as giant toy factories and arctic snowfields during his quest, facing down all manner of dangerous enemies and obstacles. He can jump and he can  launch a large fist from his stomach (he is a blob, after all). Further, different levels have special power-ups that allow the blob to assume different forms that are useful in specific circumstances. These include a hot air balloon (for floating up to special items), a hammer (for smashing obstructing blocks), a submarine (for more effectively navigating an undersea bonus level), a skateboard (for blazing through a level on a deadline), and a pogo stick (for extra high jumping). Not all of the power-ups are useful, though. One item turns Jelly Boy into a block so that he is unable to move for several seconds.

Jelly Boy collects musical notes in lieu of having a power meter. Being hit knocks away all of his collected notes and if he gets hit again without having any notes, he will lose a life. Jelly Boy also collects a variety of fruit throughout his quest. Accumulate enough fruit to earn extra lives. Certain types of fruit have other side effects (orange = more time on the clock, avocado = invincibility).</resource>

Zoom tells him that Zora, the leader of SPREE (&amp;quot;Space Pirates Revelling in Evil Enterprises&amp;quot;), is planning on looting this solar system of all its resource! Unfortunately, in his last encounter with Zora, Zoom has used up all his strength and now he is powerless so he asks George to take over. He gives George his Pneumo Osmatic Precipitator (or P.O.P.) and bids him good luck.  Can George save his family and this galaxy?

Guide George through 9 stages of intergalactic action armed with only his wits and the P.O.P....which is like a super vacuum. The P.O.P. can be used as a traveling tool by sucking onto walls and ceilings, it will enable George to climb up and across platforms.  As a weapon, the P.O.P. can be used to suck up blocks or enemies and spit out at other enemies. George can also use the P.O.P. to breathe under water! Talk about multi-functional!

George's conditions are indicated by the number of hearts he has at the top of the screen.  By collecting more hearts, it will refill George's health. Food items will increase your score and by getting a high enough score in each stage, you may get to play a bonus game.</resource>

    <resource id="39df3870657cc75f9b1c87b428686861a8c5722c" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">The third in the Paroidus series, it's the same gameplay and zaniness that substantiated the first two games. Gameplay itself is a copy (a parody rather) of Konami's famous Gradius series in that the screen scrolls from left to right (most times) and you maneuver around the screen destroying waves of enemies and avoiding obstacles. Unlike previous Parodius titles, this game contains a difficulty adjustment option, allowing the player to make things easier... or harder. Also unique to this parodius title is a bit of japanese digital voice that shouts out various things at you while you play. Survival throughout the level earns you a boss fight, which frequently includes some of the strangest characters in the game. Make no mistake, this *is* Gradius,  but with all sorts of strange graphics, music and references to other Konami games... So in other words, it's Parodius!

There are now more power-ups than ever including the standard power-up (red, used to upgrade weapons), the shield power-up (blue) and a variety of different coloured bells. Green Bells will make you huge on the screen, Yellow Bells are worth points (points in turn are worth extra lives),  Blue Bells are &amp;quot;big bombs&amp;quot; that clear the screen of enemies/shots and can be saved until you need them, White Bells will give your character a megaphone that will shout out japanese phrases, the characters of the phrases themselves can be used to damage enemies (the power of words!), The Red Bell stockpiles you with three point-defense lasers... only one of which can be activated at a time and disappear after a short while. Finally the purple bell will clear the screen of all but the strongest enemies... and will turn them into power-ups.

This time around there are 16 different characters to chose from and the power-ups and weapons that they use are more unique than ever. Several familiar &amp;quot;faces&amp;quot; return and they've brought along friends to share in the party:
Vic Viper: The &amp;quot;gradius ship&amp;quot; appears once again in this gradius parody, equipped with it's traditional gradius weapons
2. Lord British: The &amp;quot;other&amp;quot; Gradius ship and arguably the more famous of the two. Lord British has weapons similar to Vic but quite different also.Missiles and shields work differently for instance. And Lord British uses a Ripple gun instead of a double shot.
3. Pentaro: It just wouldn't be a Parodius game if Pentaro wasn't involved. Originally from Konami's Penguin Adventure, Pentaro retains the same abilities from previous Parodius games... however his Potion weapon may now hit multiple enemies and his normal weapon shots explode against obstacles
4. Hanako: Also from Penguin Adventure, Hanako the penguin is Pentaro's girlfriend. While Pentaro is blue, she is the red penguin. She plays nearly identical to Pentaro with the exception of her S. Bomb weapon
5. Twinbee: Twinbee, from the Twinbee games is another returning Parodius star. Unfortunately he hasn't been upgraded since previous games, so his weapons are nearly identical; Punching Glove Rocket and all...
6. Winbee: Winbee, also from Twinbee is red and has moves identical to Twinbee, except for one difference... when she has 3 Options available, she can power them up to harm enemies that touch them.
7. Tako: Again, it just wouldn't be a parodius game without a flying octopus. And here he is, still wearing a baseball cap, but otherwise unchanged from previous Parodius games.
8. Belial: A yellow female octopus with a bow in her hair, she is identical to Tako with the exception of her Missile and Double weapons... which are instead identical to the Vic Viper.
9. Soitsu: A stickman (now green) surfing aboard a paper airplane, Soitsu plays similar to Koitsu from the previous game, aside from his colour. His laser weapon is able to charge up to deliver more power and he drops little stickmen onto the ground which occasionally dance around rather than attacking. Additionally he has an &amp;quot;upgrade power&amp;quot; (S. Power) that make all his other abilities stronger
10. Doitsu: Similar to Soitsu but with a Double Laser ability. He is an orange stickman riding on a paper airplane and no &amp;quot;upgrade&amp;quot; power, using normal options instead
11. Upa: Upa aka The Flying Baby is back from the previous Parodius game (as well as his original game, Bokutte Upa) and plays nearly the same. Instead of a shield, he has a Mega Crush power that damages all on-screen enemies... and also has an &amp;quot;Upgrade Power&amp;quot; in the form of Grade Up that makes his other abilities stronger.
12. Rupa: Another flying baby (presumably also from Bokutte Upa), Rupa plays similar tot Upa but with a Multi Spread gun which fires missiles in multiple directions (with each upgrade) and a S.Vulcan gun which automatically aims towards enemies.
13. Mike: A cute little kitten who happens to to have a very powerful wave weapon which can travel through obstacles and enemies. Additionally he has a multiple bomb ability which requires his &amp;quot;upgrade ability&amp;quot; (Grade Up) to get really powerful
14. Rani: Another cute kitten (this one rolled onto his bottom facing forward) with very power weaponry. Some of the highlights include a Reflect weapon wherein the shots bounce off of obstacles. Another is the S laser which travels forward but then homes in Up or Down to hit the enemy. And finally, Rani's missile weapon is two homing bells. Rani also has an &amp;quot;upgrade ability&amp;quot; in the form of Grade Up, however it only upgrades the Reflect Shot.
15. Memim: One of the fairy characters, Memim is a female flying girl with standard female bikini clothing. She carries some unique missile weapons however, whose direction is determined by Memim's current location on the screen when fired.
16. Sue: The other fairy with tight clothing, Sue is unique in that her weapons are upgraded/displayed in a different order from everybody else's in the game. For instance her Option is the 4th weapon on the list rather than the 6th... requiring less power-ups to activate it. However aside from that... all of her weapons are the exact same as the Vic Viper's.</resource>

As the name implies this is a wrestling game in which wrestlers from different leagues collide in grappling contests to determine who's the king of the hill.

Select your character with his unique stats and movesets, and go at it against any opponent from four fictional leagues with dozens of moves, submission holds and rope maneuvers in or out of the ring.

The game uses pre-rendered 2D sprites and features Vs, Tournament, and League play for up to four players. Also included is a career mode where you create a wrestler and control each aspect of his career up to his final victory in the inter-league tournament. And you can also configure matches to be standard, tag (with 4 or 6 wrestlers), submission or death-matches which adds such features as live wires and explosives to the ring.</resource>

It is the first of six Super Famicom games in the franchise. The game is reminiscent of Namco's Famista series, especially with the cartoonish super-deformed athletes. As well as the usual exhibition and pennant modes, the player can practice any position in the game (batting, pitching, fielding) with any team member.

As with most games in the Power Pro series, Jikkyou Powerful Pro Yakyuu '94 was never released outside of Japan.</resource>

Jikkyou Powerful Pro Yakyuu 3 '97-Haru, also released in March of 1997, was another interstitial game that used the same engine as JPPY 3.

The game features updated rosters and details for the 1996 season of the Nippon Professional Baseball league. It carries over the large number of customizable game modes from the third game.</resource>

The gameplay is classic but dreadfully accurate. In attack it is necessary to place and have a god like timing to get a good stroke of the bat. A rectangle is displayed in front of the batter delimiting the area in which the pitcher can place the ball without being at fault, and a small square, such as a viewfinder, shows the place where we will hit. At the top of the screen, a &amp;quot;mirror&amp;quot; view shows our batters face and behind him, the receiver of the opposing team. It is necessary to observe his glove to get an idea of where the pitcher will throw. In defense we will run, dive and quickly rethrow the ball in order to eliminate the opponents who managed to hit the ball. The game modes offer a classic championship with all the real professional teams of Japanese leagues and a scenario mode where we take a match in progress in a given situation. There is also an essential training mode to improve.</resource>

This game was released on February 29, 1996 for the Super Famicom only in Japan by Konami. The game was developed by Diamond Head, a developer behind many Jikkyou Powerful Pro games. Powerful Pro 3 is a traditional baseball simulator, in the &amp;quot;super deformed&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;chibi&amp;quot; style that makes the franchise well-known.

The game is fairly similar to its predecessors, Jikkyou Powerful Pro Yakyuu '94 and Jikkyou Powerful Pro Yakyuu 2, although it does add some new features, such as Success Mode. Success Mode is an RPG-esque mode where players develop a baseball player, guiding them through situations and forming them into a &amp;quot;powerful pro.&amp;quot;

The real draw of the Powerful Pro series is the Success Mode, which was started with this game. It puts the player in control of a pre-made character who the player must develop into a powerful athlete. This is done by guiding the player through situations, making decisions, etc. As a more &amp;quot;role-playing game&amp;quot;-esque part of the game, this actually provides players with multiple save slots and options.</resource>

It iterates on the third game with a roster update for Spring of 1997, but is otherwise identical to Jikkyou Powerful Pro Yakyuu 3. '97-Haru was released after the true sequel Jikkyou Powerful Pro Yakyuu 4, which was an N64 exclusive that came out just a week earlier.

The game features a lot of voicework - hence the Jikkyou, or &amp;quot;Live Commentary&amp;quot; - and represents its characters as large-headed cartoon characters. These are series staples, and persist to the modern entries.</resource>

Using crosshairs, aim your ball to the other side of the court and hope you hit where you want.  If you are lucky, you might even score an Ace.  If not, you will need to be ready to return your opponent's return.  Run back and forth as you try to keep hitting the ball over the net until your opponent misses, or you do.  When you hit the ball, you will want to attempt changing the direction and speed of the ball to throw your opponent off balance.  This is the real challenge of any tennis game.</resource>

It offers both a practice and a tournament mode. In the tournament mode, players have to reel in some large bass, then have up to five of their largest catches weighed. Competitors are ranked by whoever brought in the heaviest haul and the player must at least rank the third heaviest during the weigh-in in order to move on to the next stage of the tournament.

Practice mode lets the player fish without all the pressures of the tournament. Players can choose from one of four different U.S. lakes, with each lake having multiple spots to fish at. Players also have the option to select what month they want to fish in and pick from six different weather conditions.

When out on the lake, players direct their boat to a spot where they want to cast their line. Players can also choose what lures and tackles they want to use. Then players have to use a meter that gauges how strong the line will be cast out. At that point, players finally get their chance to catch some big bass.</resource>

The majority of the Jissen Hisshouhou series concerns pachi-slots instead, making this a rare exception.

Like many games in its genre, it splits its focus between teaching players how various real-life pachinko machine models can be manipulated for greater pay-outs, and letting them play and win at virtual facsimiles of those machines as practice. Many of the pachinko machines featured in this game include a slot machine component, which the game also guides players through.</resource>

In a futuristic world, there lives a young man named Jojo who holds a terrible power within: the power to drain life from enemies. This power is somehow connected to the evil vampire Dio who is terrorizing the world. Jojo must find faithful companions on his quest to restore peace and to master the power within himself.

In this game, you navigate Jojo in an adventure-like fashion, viewing the hero from third-person perspective. You can call up a menu at any time to choose a command such as &amp;quot;Look&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Talk&amp;quot;, etc. Being a Japanese adventure, the game doesn't contain puzzles. from time to time, you'll be attacked by enemies and will fight them in turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective. Jojo and his party members possess the so-called &amp;quot;stands&amp;quot;, super-powerful creatures you summon during fights. before each fight, you'll have to choose one of fice available tarot cards to determine the amount of luck and compatibility of the stands you'll have in the game.</resource>

Cool, that is, until a bogus bunch of neanderthal nerds crashed their village and scared off all the cave-babes. Now the cave-babes are out there - SOMEWHERE, lost and reeeeally lonely... so what are you waitin' for? It's up to Joe and Mac to get 'em back.</resource>

This time, a caveman named Gork has stolen the crown belonging to the Chief of Kali Village, and it's up to you to retrieve it by using the 7 Rainbow Stones you will collect on your journey.

Along the way, you will fight dinosaurs, cavemen, and other prehistoric enemies as your travel through the jungle, or through the ice and snow, or even through a volcanic wasteland. Along the way, you can pick up upgrades for your club, or pick up projectiles from eating certain health-recovery items. In some levels, you'll ride in a stone cart, trying to hope over gaps and avoid enemies as you try to reach the end.

Improving on the original's platformer/brawler co-op gameplay, this game adds adventure and role-playing game elements that create a more involving experience compared to the first game. You can now collect coins in the levels to purchase items from Tiki Village, such as meat to recover your health, or even remodel your hut back at your home village. The game also uses a password system to track your progress. The game also shifts to an overhead map so you can wander to whichever level you wish, and return to completed levels to earn more money or power-ups.

The game was a multi system release so it fits the standard console jump/shoot/duck formula although it does add some unique twists such as wounding enemies so that they surrender and can be arrested.

The initial levels follow the plot of the movie with futuristic lawman Judge Dredd framed and sent to the Aspen penal colony from which he must escape and prove his innocence.  Following the fight at the top of the Statue of Liberty that ended the film, the game continues on with levels and characters inspired by the comic book culminating with a battle against the Dark Judges on Deadworld.</resource>

Unlike many games of its genre, it focuses more on the racing itself rather the gambling and management aspects of the sport which are more prominent in series like Derby Stallion or Thoroughbred Breeder.

Players still raise their racehorses, but also take an active role in the races themselves which take place in various locations both common and uncommon to horse racing, such as a beach or the Great Wall of China. There are also parts of the races where the player must leap over obstacles, meaning the player must focus on developing the horse's jumping and running strength.</resource>

Your goal is to find the human village so you may you join your kin once again. 

Mowgli is an athletic individual, and can jump, run, swing on vines or climb them without any problems. Most of the animals he comes upon, however, are inexplicably hostile, so he must defend himself with a variety of thrown weapons, such as bananas and boomerangs. 

To complete each level, Mowgli must collect a number of crystals (how many - it depends on the difficulty levels) within a time limit. A compass in the corner of the screen helps him by showing the direction where the nearest crystal is.

You play the role of a nameless young boy from a small village somewhere in the West. Your father sends you to a nearby cave to investigate the strange occurrences that were taking place there lately. You encounter  a group of rats belonging to the UrUr organization, and the mysterious King Rhinoceros. The investigation leads you further as you realize King Rhinoceros and his henchmen are after the secrets of the ancient Atimos civilization, which is guarded by seven animal sages living in different places in the world. Together with the friends you encounter on your journey, you decide to discover the secrets of Atimos and to stop the villains' plans.

&amp;quot;Jungle Wars 2&amp;quot; is a traditional console-style RPG.

    <resource id="87b999c179ad1a8e4b5e29df7cf48a19254702c3" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">The SNES game based on the film Jurassic Park is an action title that combines top-down and first-person perspectives.

Playing as Dr. Alan Grant, the player's ultimate goal is to escape the Jurassic Park island. To reach that goal, several other tasks must be completed, including restoring power to the park and destroying a Velociraptor nest. 

The large game world is seen from a top-down view and can be freely explored. Some areas are not accessible from the beginning, however. To enter them, keycards must be found or some special goal be completed, like rebooting the computer system and using it to open certain gates. Dr. Grant can defend himself against the many free-roaming dinosaurs with a variety of weapons, including an electroshock gun, a shotgun, rocket launcher, gas grenade launcher and bola gun. All weapons except the electro gun require ammo to work. A radar at the bottom of the screen helps in detecting approaching dinosaurs, but will only work once the park's motion detectors have been activated.

Upon entering one of the park's buildings, the game view switches to a scrolling first person perspective, reminiscent of early first person shooters like Wolfenstein 3D. Just like outside, dinosaurs lurk in the corridors, and the same guns as in the overworld map can be used to destroy them. Many buildings consist of several floors, with elevators connecting them. Some rooms are pitch black and can only be entered when in possession of night vision goggles.

The game supports the SNES mouse for the first-person sections and the computer system interface.</resource>

Meanwhile, Biosyn Corp has sent men down the former park so the company can gain control of the park for themselves.

In this 2D shooter, Player 1 controls Dr. Alan Grant and Player 2 controls Tactical Sergeant Michael Wolfskin and alone or together you face off against the free roaming dinosaurs of the once known Jurassic Park along with the members of the Biosyn Corp.  Your player always has six weapons.  Your primary machine gun and cattle prod are unlimited and most take down both the humans and dinosaurs but some only work the dinosaurs such as the cattle prod.  Most of the levels are non linear so you must explore different pathways to complete the mission you have selected once you have once you selected either one or two player mode.

The player commands the human army. The mission in each battle is to defeat the enemy army or take their headquarters in a limited amount of turns. In the human army's main building, the player can recruit new soldiers, but their number is limited. Each unit has its own statistics, including range, speed and attack power. Battles are carried out automatically, with animations on a separate screen.

There are three mission modes which include Campaign, Tutorial, and Expert modes and there is also a two-player versus mode.</resource>

In order to advance to the next level, all bombs need to detonate. There are various sizes of bombs. Bigger ones have such a huge blast radius that Bombuzal cannot trigger them directly - instead, he has to explode smaller bombs first and cause a chain reaction. So as one might imagine, later levels turn into loud blastfests that need to be carefully planned.

Besides, later levels introduce all kinds of additional hazards and gimmicks, like ice floors, movable bombs, disappearing ground tiles, and much more. Nobody said being a pyromaniac is easy.

Most of the characters and enemies are based on some aspect of Kabuki, including the wild-haired protagonist Rock.

Many other elements are based around performance arts, including a Paper Mario-esque &amp;quot;stage&amp;quot; backgrounds for random encounters.

RED Entertainment were better known at the time for their Tengai Makyou series, which were being published by Hudson. For this game, which was published by Atlus instead, RED created a new universe that nonetheless feels mechanically similar to their Tengai Makyou games.

The game was never released outside of Japan.</resource>

Like most visual novels, the gameplay involves the player reading the text from the game screen, and making decisions which will affect the path and outcome of the narrative. The choices and consequences form a big part of the gameplay, with the narrative often branching out in completely different directions depending on what choices the player makes, with even seemingly minor decisions having a big impact on how the narrative unfolds. In total, the game has over forty different endings.
The game follows a psychological horror narrative that revolves around Toru and his girlfriend Mari, who are suddenly drawn into a horrible murder mystery while on vacation at a skiing lodge. The story unfolds as the characters attempt to solve the mystery. Additional murders occur if the player is unable to find clues, and the story culminates in a number of endings befitting a horror tale.</resource>

Like its predecessor, released on the Famicom in 1990, the game crosses fishing game elements such as finding bait and ideal fishing spots with RPG elements such as fighting wildlife in turn-based battles and growing more experienced over time. Cash and XP earned while fishing or roaming around contribute to the player's angling ability.

The player can select one of four family members, a trademark of the series. Each character has slightly different goals, but they usually culminate in becoming a strong enough fisherperson to catch &amp;quot;the River King&amp;quot;: a legendary freshwater fish.

Though the game is labelled as Kawa no Nushi Tsuri 2, the second game in the series was actually the 1992 game Kawa no Nushi Tsuri: Shizenha for the PC Engine.</resource>

It includes 14 standard-length race tracks, plus the Suzuka 8 Hours endurance race, available in both training and Championship modes. The game is unlicensed (except by Kawasaki), so all riders and teams are fictional.

The game now has more polygonal roadside objects than F1, and there is still a Turbo mode, allowing for faster racing at the expense of some of the detail. You have the ability to turn on or off weather (during rainy days the graphics are darker and the bike has less traction). The number of laps on each course can be 5, 10 or 15, and there are 4 skill levels. Some changes have been made to how the vehicle handles, to emphasize the switch from cars to bikes.

Next to exhibition games, there are different game modes to compete in. In the MLB Challenge, players start with a weak team and go against every major MLB club to go up the rankings. There is also a complete World Series, All-Star games and the MLB League. In the league modes up to eight players can choose a team and play a season of 26, 52 or 162 games. Between matches players can change the line-up and rotation, and trade away players.

Gameplay is fairly tradition, with fielding, pitching, batting and baserunning. Next to fastball and curveballs, there are six different pitches such as Super Fast, Screwball, Super Curve, Slider, Change Up and Knuckleball.

    <resource id="583b1e7ff41f070dea2474ecaa9581e75ed6d3bc" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Josephine is a teenage girl who is currently attending Honest Osaki's Kendo School and Used Car Sales to learn Kendo swordsmanship. The old man Osaki teaches his students the art of psychic powers so they can better defeat the forces of evildoers. Josephine is given the Zopikki Talisman; a powerful artifact which transforms Josephine's normal self into a battle warrior. Gripping the bamboo sword and focusing her psychic powers, Josephine must defeat ghosts, pandas and all kinds of other strange creatures which look to cause trouble.

In Kendo Rage, the player takes control of Josephine. She can move left and right, jump, duck and attack with her bamboo sword. Josephine's psychic powers are shown on a bar and recharge gradually at a steady pace, changing color as they do. Depending on the color, an attack done will use up the current psychic energy and let loose a stronger attack, usually a projectile. Additionally, Josephine can summon flames around herself during a rush attack, at the cost of some energy. The game lasts seven levels, with a boss finishing off each level.</resource>

One day Onimaru discovers a trap door leading to a secret room, where he finds two huge statues of ancient gods - Fuujin, the wind god, and Raijin, the lightning god. Onimaru realizes the swords of those gods hold an immense power, trains with the sword of the Fuujin, and becomes possessed by it.

In the game there are four competitions (World Cup Finals, League, Knock Out Cup and the challenge). There is several options for game speed and ball control to suit both novice and skilled gamers. Each of the 32 teams in the game has a distinct style of play, ensuring that no two games are alike. Each team also has &amp;quot;key players&amp;quot;, such as Liberos and Wingers, who play a pivotal role in how that team plays. Kick Off 3 offers two styles of play: Arcade and Simulation. The difference is that in the Arcade mode you can switch of rules to focus purely on reflexes.</resource>

    <resource id="f5c4b4939634c5aca5c5c2d4c49598d82f1dbf3d" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">This is an RPG that was only released on the SNES, which also shares its name with several other titles across different systems, due to them all being based on the same Anime series &amp;quot;Patlabor&amp;quot;.
In this RPG, you control the two main pilots from the series/films, Noa Izumi and Isao Ota, as you complete your typical duties each day, helping to deal with rogue Labors (Mecha) and other such incidents. The game, only having been released in Japan, is only really advisable to play if you understand Japanese, as it really is a text-heavy game.
The gameplay consists of three screens - a map of Japan, showing where your asignments are located, the &amp;quot;main&amp;quot; screen, where you control your Labor from a top-down viewpoint and maneuver it around the area of the crime. Finally, there's the combat screen, for when you press the action button to attack a rogue Labor. From here you can select one of various attacks; naturally, as the game goes on your pilots can learn new attacks, though unusually for an RPG there's also the option to just talk with the rogue Labor's pilot and try to convince them to back down - as a policeman, sometimes this is the only way forward.
This is a fairly typical Eastern RPG with a fairly unique setting. Just don't forget your Kanji-English dictionary!</resource>

It is specifically based on the second incarnation of the anime series, Zeta Gundam, which revisits the original series Mobile Suit Gundam (also known as &amp;quot;Gundam 0079&amp;quot; to distinguish it from its sequels) eight years after the climactic conclusion of the One Year War. Like many Gundam games it was published by Bandai and created by an unknown number of Bandai's contract developers.

The game is built on the blueprint of the 1995 Super Famicom isometric strategy game Cross Dimension 0079. It offers a similar interface and adherence to the lore with an ample number of cutscenes. Away to the Newtype also incorporates elements of the 1986 Famicom action game Hot Scramble, also based on the Zeta manga/anime series, for its &amp;quot;long range&amp;quot; combat mode. This mode plays like a first-person shooter and was one of the three modes that comprises Hot Scramble.</resource>

At the start of the game the player can choose from Red Jack, Silver Jack, or Blue Jack. Red and Silver both have weapons they can find ammo for in levels (a gun and baton, respectively), and all three can do a multiple hit combo or a jumping attack. At the end of a level the Jack will be met by his vehicle which will then merge with his armor. In this form the Jack's attacks are strengthened and he can charge up an attack that hits every enemy onscreen.

There is no story told at any point in the game, so if you want to know what's going on you'll have to track down the anime.</resource>

Unleash your mahjong power!!!
Jantoushi Doraou is a simple mahjong game for the Super Famicom. It features a wide variety of strange and ridiculous characters and is largely comical in nature. It follows typical Japanese mahjong rules, although there are a few exceptions (mentioned below). Many characters are also capable of performing special attacks when their &amp;quot;cosmo&amp;quot; meter is full; these attacks can have many different incarnations, from simply beating the opponent unconscious for a win (surprisingly ineffective) to instantly getting a ron. The game also features a password feature which allows players to save their progress.

Story

The player assumes the role of the titular Jantoushi Doraou, a master mahjong Saint who resides in Sanctuary and is committed to protecting the goddess Atenaide. Unfortunately, the villainous Mahjong warlock Jankou invades Sanctuary and seemingly kidnaps Atenaide! It's Doraou's duty to rescue her from the clutches of this fiend, and he sets off on a journey to gather the other Mahjong Saints and journey to Jankou's castle to rescue her. This journey winds through a number of towers with guardians based on the Chinese Zodiac; this is a direct parody of Saint Seiya, where the Gold Saints are based off of the Greco-Roman zodiac.</resource>

Kikuni Masahiko no Jantoushi Dora Ou 2 is a bit more &amp;quot;free&amp;quot;, allowing the player to explore the world map. It also allows for four-person games, removing the two-person limitation of its forebear.</resource>

Many fighters answer the challenge to participate, including several of Ultratech's experimental warriors.  To increase the tournament's challenge, Ultratech utilizes a technology that can create bridges between alternate dimensions, releasing a creature known as Eyedol.  Eyedol is a two-headed ancient warrior that was imprisoned along with his bitter rival, Gargos. Some warriors enter the tournament to seek glory or escape.  Other fighters are attempting to bring an end to Ultratech's corruption.  

Killer Instinct is a Rare developed fighting game published by Nintendo (and distributed in the arcades by Midway).  Killer Instinct (or &amp;quot;KI&amp;quot; among its fanbase) is a 2D fighting game that features 3D rendered sprite based graphics. Players choose from 10 characters: Orchid, Cinder, Jago, Glacius, Fulgore, Riptor, Sabrewulf, Spinal, T.J. Combo, and Thunder.  

Killer Instinct is known for its heavy combo based fighting system, allowing players to pull off moves that land an insane number of hits on their opponent, the highest being the &amp;quot;Ultra Combo&amp;quot;.  The gameplay is also known for its use of combo breakers, finishing moves and stage fatalities, double energy bars, and dance-music inspired techno soundtrack.</resource>

Only the Spell of Spells would be able to free them. Merlin, knowing that the world would come to ruin without King Arthur uses his magic to search all of space and time for replacements. Finding the New York Knights football team and their quarterback, Arthur King, Merlin transports them back to Camelot and gives them magical armor. Transformed into; Sir Arthur, Sir Breeze, Sir Brick, Sir Darren, Sir Gallop, Sir Lancelot, Sir Lug, Sir Phil, Sir Tone, Sir Trunk, Sir Wally and Sir Zeke,  they must rescue the real Knights of the Round Table. In order to do so, the Arthur must recover the 12 keys of truth from Morgana's lieutenants each of which can only by touched by a specific knight. However in order to be able to defeat them, Arthur must first recover Excalibur and overcome other tasks.

King Arthur &amp; the Knights of Justice is a top-down action game. It might be mistaken for an RPG, however the abilities of characters do not change over the course of the game. Players control Arthur King and can recruit two additional party members from the knights. Each knight has his own statistics in various areas including: Life Force, Defense, Strength and Speed. These party members are computer controlled with their own energy bars. Arthur can move up, down, left and right, block with his shield and parry with his shield. Arthur can swing his sword at any time but the damage inflicted depends on how much strength bar he has. The strength bar replenishes itself naturally over time, but is depleted every time Arthur swings his sword. Each knight including Arthur has a health bar, when this bar runs out, the knight is defeated. It can be restored by returning to Camelot or using items such as healing herbs. Arthur can carry a variety of different items accessible from the menu. Other menu functions include looking at the map, changing preferences and reviewing the statistics of the knights.</resource>

It stands as a sequel and plays similar to the previous KoF '98 and KoF '99. Many of the backgrounds are lifted directly from other games (Fatal Fury) or heavily altered (Marvel Super Heroes). Similar to '98, the characters don't get their own stages. Instead, you fight three characters separately on one stage. After beating these three characters, you are sent to the next stage, or the ending if you're on the final stage.</resource>

Choose from three monsters which include a large lizard, a large robotic ape, and a huge mutant human.

When smashed, some buildings reveal power-ups that make your character more powerful. At the end of each city, you go head-to-head with the boss creature. There are small stages in between where you fight a second monster for bonus points, or you fall from the sky and land underwater where you try to collect points and power-ups while falling.

Game Academy!&amp;quot;) is a multiplayer party game based on the Kingyo Chuuihou! (Goldfish Warning!) manga and anime. The anime is about a rich girl named Chitose who loses her fortune and is forced to enroll in a public rural school that accepts barnyard animals as students. The anime charts her attempts to refine/gentrify those around her, including her new best friend Wapiko (the pink-haired girl on the cover/title screen).

The game allows for up to three players. Each &amp;quot;mini-game&amp;quot; is selected from a roulette, and players compete to earn 100 points the quickest. These mini-games can range from trivia contests to more action-oriented fare. Most mini-games have their own rules concerning gaining (and losing) points to pay attention to.

Kingyo Chuuihou! Tobidase! Game Gakuen was released on the Super Famicom in 1994 and was never released outside of Japan. It is the only Kingyo Chuuihou game on the Super Famicom: the other two were created for the Nintendo Game Boy prior to this game.</resource>

In this game you will be able to choose among 6 relevant characters of the aforementioned saga, including the enemies of Kinnikuman. Combats will be 1 vs 1 and you will be able to execute a repertory of man to man acrobatic tactics, and of course, all combats will end either with a countdown or a surrender of one of the combatants.

There are varying modes of play, such as Time Trial, Challenge and Story Mode, but the basic idea of play is the same: you must sandwich Star Blocks between two like Friend Blocks, either horizontally or vertically. The Friend Blocks and any Star Blocks in-between are then removed from play. Similar to Tetris, sets of blocks fall into the bin that contain any two of the following types:

Star Blocks: The most important block, as all of the game types rely on it. Sandwich these blocks between two Friend Blocks either horizontally or vertically, and they will be cleared. The more stars you clear, the higher the score.

Friend Blocks: These blocks have pictures of Kirby's friends - Rick the Hamster, Kine the Fish, and Coo the Owl (all from Kirby's Dream Land 2) - on them. Match two of each to clear them from the screen. Any Star Blocks between the two character blocks will also be cleared.

Bomb Blocks: Sandwich a Bomb Block in between two Friend Blocks, and the bomb will explode, removing all blocks in the same row.

Hard Blocks: You have to clear these blocks twice to clear them from the screen. Clear them once and they transform into an ordinary Star Block, and then can be removed in the normal way.

The game also features a 'chain' system that rewards you for clearing blocks which then clear other blocks. If you clear two or more blocks in this manner, then you'll be rewarded with Kirby raining down that amount of Stars, which can fill in gaps, which in turn could complete a row and allow it to chain even further.</resource>

After his adventures in Dream Land we find him in this mini golf game where Kirby himself is the ball, and you must guide him around each hole using the sort of bar system that you see in most golf games. Where this game differs, however, is in the fact that you need to eliminate all on-screen enemies before you can guide Kirby into the hole and complete it. As per usual in golf games, the more strokes it takes you to complete the whole, the lower your score - so make sure you aim Kirby just right!

You'll find eight courses and a total of sixty-four holes in the game, not including the final showdown with King Dedede, as well as an action-packed two-player mode.</resource>

These are all typical Kirby platformers, each one with its own set of levels and different gameplay. In most of them you can consume monsters and learn their special abilities, but in Milky Way Wishes abilities are instead collected in a manner similar to Metroid. Offensive Cave features levels with various obstacles, hidden treasures and some elementary lever-pulling kind of puzzle solving. Metaknight's Revenge is the only game on the cartridge with a (fairly strict) timer. The Arena is a &amp;quot;boss rush&amp;quot; mode, asking players to defeat every boss in the game with limited health refills and on one life.
Kirby Super Star is best known for its two-player cooperative play option, which has given it a reputation as a party game.</resource>

Avalanche is similar to Puyo Puyo, and has you stacking colored blobs similar in a way to Tetris. When a certain amount of one color is stacked, an explosion occurs and the screen clears of those blobs, which then appear in the other players screen (either the CPU or a second player). When your screen is cleared before the other player, you move onto the next round, and so on until the final boss. The winner of that match is then crowned the Avalanche king.

Chiaki has a vision of five cloaked figures and knows that only she and Zenki can stop them. At once they set off to track down the demon leaders.

In Kishin Douji ZENKI: Battle Raiden the player takes the role of Zenki. At first, and occasionally through the game, Zenki will be in his powered down form where he can only punch, jump, and dash. After Chiaki recovers her bracelet, or regains her concentration, or whatever she needs to do at the time, she can transform Zenki into his powered up form. In this form Zenki deals more damage and has a much longer list of attacks that get added to as the game progresses, such as a pillar of energy, an electrified punch, and a dashing attack. By picking up scrolls Zenki can do a powerful Rudora attack to all enemies on screen, but this attack damages Zenki as well.

To complete platforming levels Zenki will have to make it to the end of the level while occasionally finding hidden stone monuments that, when destroyed, will drop items as well as alter the level or remove obstacles, allowing Zenki to pass. After a stage's first platforming level is a midboss fight, and after the second platforming level is the boss fight proper.</resource>

It is the second of three games based on the license to be released for the Super Famicom.

It features characters and plot details from Kishin Douji Zenki, usually just known as Zenki, supernatural manga and anime about a powerful but benevolent demon guardian named Zenki and his human companion, the shrine maiden Chiaki. Centuries previously, Chiaki's ancestor used Zenki to defeat the evil goddess Kurama - the manga/anime begins with Kurama's return and Chiaki accidentally releasing Zenki.

The game is unusual as it splits its time between two modes that are distinct both tonally and mechanically. The &amp;quot;mature&amp;quot; Zenki, in his most powerful form, fights various demon minions of Kurama in tactical one-on-one battles that use a real-time progress bar that needs to be filled at least partially before an attack can be launched. This mode is similar to the gameplay used in other anime license action games, such as YuYu Hakusho and YuYu Hakusho Tokubetsu Hen. The other mode is a more cartoonish platformer featuring Chiaki as she attempts to assist Zenki by completing various objectives. Chiaki resorts to her magic to protect herself.</resource>

The game follows Chiaki Enno, a descendant of the master priest who sealed away the evil Goddess Karuma, and Zenki, the spirit guardian Chiaki's ancestor allied with, in a quest to once again defeat Karuma now that she has resurfaced.

The game was the third Kishin Douji Zenki game to be released for the Super Famicom and the fifth overall. It would also be the last.

The game employees an unusual structure which combines elements of board games, puzzle games and strategy games. Chiaki and Zenki move a certain number of spaces across a board determined by a dice roll. The player can also spend movement points on moving the tiles around the world, which is often necessary to create a route to the exit.

If the player bumps into one of Karuma's eyeball minions, the game switches to a battle in which Zenki and his opponent draw cards and attack based on the icon on the card: these might involve fireballs, martial arts or spirit beams.

It is possible to use special abilities to wipe enemies off the board, preventing the necessity of fighting them and minimizing the chance of Zenki falling in combat before the player can win the board. More special abilities become unlocked as the player progresses.</resource>

It uses the Kiteretsu Daihyakka license: a manga and eventual anime from the creators of Doraemon about a genius kid inventor who uses a book of designs to create wondrous devices such as a time machine and his samurai robot companion Korosuke. He is joined with his friends in his various adventures: Miyoko Nonohana, his girlfriend; Kaoru Kumada, a local bully; and Tongari, who is skittish and easily frightened.

The game is similar to other board game adaptations for 16-bit consoles. Players move around a board and receive bonuses or penalties depending on where they land. There are a number of boards to choose from, each with different themes.

The player rolls a die and moves a certain number of spaces around a board. Depending on where they land, they either earn points, lose points, gain a special item or take part in an event. Generally speaking, blue squares are beneficial, red squares are detrimental and golden squares provide bonus items.

If a player lands on the same square as another character, they get into a contest: the winner of these contests will be able to take an item from the loser. The contests are generally simple mini-games, such as a sprint race or a sumo battle.</resource>

The story tells of a man who pulled the mighty sword Excalibur from a rock which no one else could achieve. This feat signified that he should be king of the Britons and lead them to peace. The trouble is there is mass chaos in the land and the only way Arthur can stop it is to find the holy grail which has been hidden for over a thousand years. Aurthur is joined by Percival and Lancelot on his quest to find the grail. 

The gameplay involves the player to scroll along the screen fighting of enemies with a sword or axe depending on the character. The player can also block and parry with opponents which is done by a simple button press. There are also character development elements in the game where collecting points by killing enemies and picking up gold increase the character's attack and speed.  Character's armour and weapons also change when they gain experience.</resource>

Originally released on the PC-FX console in 1995, it was quickly ported to 3DO and Super Famicom the same year with different developer/publisher teams.

The game is based on an original video animation (OVA) that reimagines the Pacific Theater during World War 2 in which the Japanese navy had a significant advantage that would lead to a different outcome to the global conflict. This advantage is the eponymous submarine fleet, which proves to be almost unstoppable. The OVA was in turn inspired by a novel by Yoshio Aramaki of the same name.

The gameplay depicts each mission, taken from the OVA, as an isometric grid-based conflict between the player's forces and the enemy's fleet. In most scenarios, the enemy fleet belongs to the United States Navy. Different types of ships serve different applications in combat.</resource>

The main hero of the game is Shun, a teenager who lives in modern-day Japan. One day, when he was going back from school with his girlfriend Michiko, Shun noticed a strange red-eyed rabbit. When he tried to follow him, Shun suddenly found himself all alone in a forest clearing. He was immediately approached by a group of four adventurers who said they were members of a group called R.A.G.E. (Resistance Against God of Evil). Apparently, Shun was transported into a parallel medieval world, and an evil organization known as Vile was the one behind Michiko's kidnapping. Shun and his friends will now do anything to help Michiko and to destroy Vile!

This is a traditional console-style RPG. You travel on the world map, visit towns, buy equipment and items, descend into dungeons, and fight random enemies in turn-based combat viewed from a third-person &amp;quot;over-the-shoulder&amp;quot; perspective. The party can hold up to five characters. The characters level up in a standard way, and also get experience and new levels for their magical spells.

The player, as Kraemer, must succeed in various campaigns led by Nazi Germany just before and up until the end of the second World War.

The game was originally released on the NEC PC-9801 by General Support and was ported to the Super Famicom two years later by Dual and Asmik Ace. The Super Famicom version was followed by two sequels: Koutetsu no Kishi 2: Sabaku no Rommel Shougun and Koutetsu no Kishi 3: Gekitotsu Europe Sensen. It was one of a handful of games to support the SNES Mouse peripheral.

Possibly due to its focus on German WW2 campaigns, neither Koutetsu no Kishi nor its sequels were ever released outside of Japan.</resource>

Koutetsu no Kishi 2 is the second game in the Koutetsu no Kishi series, all of which depend on raising and deploying troops (especially tanks, the titular &amp;quot;steel knights&amp;quot;) and sending them against enemy forces to take strategically vital territory. It sits between Koutetsu no Kishi and Koutetsu no Kishi 3: Gekitotsu Europe Sensen.</resource>

Whenever you switch to a different characters, the inactive characters in your party gradually regain their hit points. There are no weapons and armor to buy or to find in the game, but the character level up and become stronger from defeating enemies, and collect items those enemies drop.

Season lets the player compete in an entire season on all the tracks, earning prize money to buy parts to upgrade their car.  They can change parts to maximize performance or even tweak the car such as change gear ratios, spoiler height, tire pressure, etc.  

There is  also an option that allows for a two-player head-to-head battle that utilizes a split screen.

It also features a track editor that lets the player build their own dream track and race on it against computer opponents or against a friend.  

While the game does gear itself in appearances and style towards NASCAR, it doesn't feature any full license from them.  It does, however, feature the likeness and endorsement of NASCAR driver Kyle Petty, son of NASCAR legend Richard Petty and grandson of NASCAR pioneer Lee Petty.</resource>

Graphics were improved to fit SNES standard, and there were some slight changes made to the interface (to resemble the classic look of  Shin Megami Tensei, especially in the first game).

The first  Megami Tensei follows the story of Nakajima, a programmer who has to become a devil summoner in order to stop an invasion from another world. Dungeon navigation and battles are viewed from first person perspective.

 Megami Tensei II puts you in the role of a nameless hero, a member of Devil Buster group who fight demons in a post-apocalyptic world that was caused by an atomic explosion in the end of the 20th century. Dungeon navigation gets a new top-down view in this sequel.

    <resource id="85ad68eb927a7ea131e1a339538b082360392bdb" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Lady is a girl from a good family. So, is she a good girl? Well, not really... she doesn't care much for good manners and diligent study, but thinks only about faraway lands and treasure. Wherever she appears, destruction follows... Lady's parents, afraid of their daughter's hyperactive nature, locked her in a mansion guarded by two loyal servants: the gardener Yoshio and the cook Cocks (yes, that's the name!). One day, Lady finds a book about Deathland Island, where supposedly a great treasure is hidden. She escapes the mansion, arrives at Deathland Island, and learns its was once ruled by a mad scientist King Baron, who made experiments on monsters. Lady decides to explore Baron's castle and the rest of the island, to find a way to get to the legendary treasure.

&amp;quot;Lady Stalker&amp;quot; is an isometric action RPG, closely connected to the more known game  Landstalker for Sega Genesis. You explore dungeons and other locations, most of which are full of various puzzles. You can't jump, but you can dash (jumping over small pits) instead. The regular battles are random. Once you enter a battle, you control Lady in real-time, but later in the game, other characters join the party. Those characters are controlled by the AI, but you can pause the battle at any time and assign commands to them.

The Blue Dragon Knights of the Rayguard Empire are trying to steal the virtuous sorceress Riana. Their goal is to make her serve the evil Emperor Bozel, whose intention is to find the most powerful evil sword in the land, the Alhazard. Naturally, the main hero of the game, the knight Elwin, has not only to rescue Riana, but to retrieve the legendary holy sword Langrisser, the only artifact that is more powerful than Alhazard. At first, Elwin automatically follows the &amp;quot;good&amp;quot; path, but as the game progresses, he can choose whether to continue being good, to become an ally with Rayguard, or to side with the forces of Chaos whose goal is utter destruction.

&amp;quot;Der Langrisser&amp;quot; features a complex character creation process, during which you must answer morally ambiguous questions,  Ultima-style, that will determine the class and the attributes of the main hero. The game is a strategy RPG in which you control your party only during battles. You just hire soldiers and unite them under commands of generals. When your units attack the enemy, an automatic battle sequence occurs. You can also use magic spells to heal your troops or to harm enemy soldiers.</resource>

On the outskirts of the town stands the Weathertop mansion. It was just an ordinary place until the last owner, Benedict Weathertop, started practicing black magic. He killed his parents and populated the mansion with all kinds of undead. Since then, nobody dared to approach the mansion. But a short while ago, two boys were found dead near this horrible place. Apparently, the boys had tried to enter the mansion. Another evidence pointed out that a girl followed them - but her body hasn't been found yet, and there is a slight hope she might be alive. This is where you, the hero of the game, decide to investigate the mystery, and to venture into the mansion...

Laplace no Ma is a Japanese-style RPG with horror elements. You are not stuck in the mansion, but can leave it, visit the town, and buy supplies. Later you also visit other locations such as a castle, etc.</resource>

He just turned sixteen, and on the day of his initiation he receives a task from the Great Magician Fehbennels: he has to go to a nearby cave and to retrieve a precious gem. When Kurt returns home, he meets an injured soldier from the Silver Castle. He says the castle was attacked by the army of the evil warlock Glud. The Great Magician Fehbennels sends Kurt to king Gustaf and the ruler of the Silver Castle, Lord Yuri. Kurt gets involved in a conflict between different nations, and meets the elven girl Mei and other companions on his quest to defeat the ultimate evil.

The game is a Japanese-style RPG: you navigate Kurt and his party on the world map, visiting towns, descending into dungeons, and fighting random enemies and bosses. The battles are set in auto-mode and are a mixture of turn-based and real time styles. You can stop the flow of a battle by accessing a menu and assigning commands to your characters. The battles are viewed from a third-person perspective, and the characters move around the battle field automatically while performing their attacks. The characters can use physical attacks and a variety of offensive and defensive magic.</resource>

You control Shieru, a young boy who lives in a small village on a planet with a medieval civilization. With the help of his friends, he should fulfill an ancient prophecy and defeat the evil that threatens the planet. In order to do that, the heroes of the game have to recruit demons who will help them in battles.

As a part of Megaten universe, &amp;quot;Last Bible III&amp;quot; is focused on demon summoning and fusion. The concept is more developed in this game, since demons are now fully customizable characters that can level up and be equipped just like human party members. Unlike most Megaten games, &amp;quot;Last Bible III&amp;quot; is set in a medieval environment and has a more traditional flair. The battles are viewed from first person perspective in a standard Megaten fashion, but movement on the world map, in towns and in dungeons is controlled from third person perspective with a top-down view.

    <resource id="40542133e558e853c471085528be266006b0ada2" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">The Lawnmower Man is the game based on the 1992 movie of the same name (itself loosely based on a Stephen King short story)  starring pre-Bond fame Pierce Brosnan as Dr. Lawrence Angelo, a scientist working for Virtual Space Industries in &amp;quot;Project 5&amp;quot;, a secret research that attempts to increase the intelligence of primates using psychotropic drugs and VR training. 

With his reluctance to aim the research to military purpose, after one of the chimps escapes and shoots a guard in the process he is given a forced vacation, and while taking notes on the need for experiment with a human subject, he notices Jobe Smith (Jeff Fahey), a simpleton who makes his living on odd jobs such as mowing the grass (hence, the title role). The first experiments quickly increase Jobe's intelligence, and while after an accident Angelo stopped the experiments, The Shop, a secret agency overviewing Project 5, reinserted the drugs responsible for violent behaviour into the program and sped up the treatment. As Jobe starts to develop telekinetic powers, he starts to take revenge on those who abused him before he started the treatments, and plots to take over all computers in the world.

While the CD version of the game (PC, Mega CD) is an interactive movie, both cartridge versions are platformers, the player taking control of Dr. Angelo or Carla Parkette (mother of Jobe's best friend) in typical side-scrolling shooting action. The player can collect better weapons or data discs, which after collecting a number of them allow to morph into the Virtual Suit, which gives protection against a first hit. The player visits several locations seen in the movie, such as the gas pump and the VSI headquarters. 

The twists of the game are true-3D level connectors, based on the CG sequences of the movie, usually all involving avoiding obstacles (and the occasional shooting) at high speed in the VR world. There are four different (Virtual World, Cyber War, Cyber Run and Cyber Tube), each taking a slightly different approach (Virtual World is seen in first person, the objective being dodging obstacles such as trees and archs and reach the exit, Cyber War similar to Virtual World but with some shooting stops, Cyber Run is seen in third person and requires occasional shooting of obstacles, while Cyber Tube is a fast travel with plenty of enemies in a VR tunnel).</resource>

Its employees are considered by most people to be winning the &amp;quot;rat race.&amp;quot;
The game challenges young people to create their own business empire by researching and marketing better VHS machines for the Japanese consumers. The player is introduced to jazzy instrumental song being played in the background while neon pictures of various people fly across the screen. As of 2011, there has been no attempt to produce an English language version for this game either through official channels or through unofficial emulator translator groups. This game is considered to be in Japanese for the full duration of the game, making literacy skills in Japanese mandatory. Only the brand names themselves use ASCII letters; all other words use the Japanese alphabet. There are only two time periods in the game and jazz music plays throughout the entire game.</resource>

You have to rid the kingdom of Sellech of the king's evil son Clovius, who wants to conquer the kingdom by harnessing the power of the imprisoned soul of Beldor, who once ruled over Sellech as a despot.

To complete your quest, you must fight your way through numerous enemies using different combinations of slashes and kicks. You cannot perform any throws, but there are different magic attacks and a special attack. The special attack is a ranged attack that consumes a certain amount of energy, whereas the different spells use up magic bags that can be found throughout the game and damage every enemy on screen. Defeated enemies drop different kinds of items such as magic bags , food to replenish your health, money and keys that are used to open treasure chests in some of the bonus-games that take place in-between battles. Naturally, at the end of each stage, a powerful boss is waiting to be defeated.</resource>

Concerned, that a new evil has appeared, the two set out to confront it at the temple. This is just the beginning of a new adventure that will take them Goemon and his partner all across Japan; into moutain villages, amusement parks, castle fortresses and more!

Players control either Goemon or his partner Ebisu-Maru (or both, in 2 player mode). They sequentially travel through adventure-type villages and side-scrolling jump and run action stages. In the overhead-view villages, enemies must be defeated in order to earn money and other items (which include a weapon-enhancing lucky cat and mystical scrolls). The player is able to attack with their primary weapon and jump. Throwing weapons can also be used, which consume money for each one thrown. Attacking innocent villagers will cause the player to lose money. Money can also be gained (or lost) by visiting one of the numerous mini games, often in houses: which include mazes, whack-a-mole, the lottery, dice, a 3D labyrinth and a game trivia quiz show. Other businesses such as shops, resturants, inns and judo training can also be visited.

At the end of each village is an &amp;quot;action area&amp;quot; which changes the game in a complete side-scroller. One or both players can enter this place, filled with obstacles, traps, enemies and a boss creature. In addition to the regular moves used in town, players also gain the ability to unleash one of four special attacks for each character (if bought beforehand at the judo training center). These consume the scrolls collected in order to use. Additionally, in a 2 player game, characters can ride piggy-back on one another, to avoid getting stuck by a scrolling screen.</resource>

You are in control not of any individual Lemming, but of a cross-hair, which can be moved over any of the Lemmings. Along the bottom are a selection of functions which can be assigned to a Lemming, including climbing, floating and bashing. You must click to select the appropriate function, then click on the Lemming to activate it. Each level has a different range of skills on offer, a different amount of Lemmings, and a different percentage target in order to progress.</resource>

The Lemmings have split into 12 distinct tribes, each of which has their own landscape and their own cultural identity - they include Egyptian, Circus and Highland. However, Lemming Island is now in danger, and you must complete 10 levels for each tribe in order for them to reunite and reassemble the Talisman from the 12 pieces.

Across the 120 levels there are over 60 skills, although no more than 10 are in use on each screen. The Classic tribe has the ones form the original and is perhaps the best option for first-time players.</resource>

The game is set in a world of Andell - a floating continent where ancient prophecies and highly advanced technology co-exist. A curse has fallen onto Andell - its four island, once united, are now separated, and are floating away from the heart of the continent, the temple of Andell. The sages of the temple summon a great hero named Farse, who must find a special magic orb for each one of the islands, which is the only way to re-unite them. Farse embarks on his journey, aided by three Terranos, the big-eared inhabitants of Andell.

This is a console-style RPG where you control a party containing the main hero Farse and three Terranos you select out of the available five. You encounter random enemies and bosses and fight them in turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective. You can use special attacks and magical spells, which don't consume magic points, but take away a certain amount of your hit points. Instead of healing items, you have mini-bottles you can refill with potions in special places in towns. You can equip various magical artifacts which will allow you to use magic spells belonging to eight different elements.</resource>

Without thinking, Lester stretched out on a pallet that was ready for loading onto a nearby freighter.  And fell asleep.

Boy, did he pick a bad place to take  a nap.  Several hours out of port he woke up and found himself in deep trouble (and more than a little seasick).  The ship's captain believed his story about being an accidental stowaway.  But... only in cases of extreme medical emergency could the ship return to port.  And Lester wasn't that seasick.  Yet...

So, he was along for the ride...  until the first port of call.  But as chance would have it, pirates hijacked and scuttled the freighter.  Luckily enough, Lester found a life vest before the ship sank and swam for the nearest tropical island.

Just before reaching the beach Lester passed out from sheer exhaustion.  Now, his real adventure begins...

It is up to you to help Lester get back home.

You'll face such things as giant seagulls, panthers, pirates, and the spirits of the underworld.</resource>

At first glance, the gameplay resembles Taito's Qix. The player controls two &amp;quot;arrows&amp;quot;, one red (Libble) and one blue (Rabble) with a line strung between them. The object is to wrap the line around poles and surround Mushlins and enemies with it. The player can either close the loops themselves (worth more points for the Mushlins) or move both arrows to the same edge of the screen. The player clears a &amp;quot;season&amp;quot; when he or she harvests all the Mushlins.</resource>

The European Wars against Spain and France have been costly to the British Empire. In order to gain additional funds for the war effort, the Crown raise taxes from the New World colonies without representation. This act compels the New World colonies to protest and boycott against British rule. By 1775, the Crown alarmed by the protests, boycotts and politically instability in the New World sends troops to subdue any rebellious efforts by the New World colonists. This threatening approach provokes the Thirteen Colonies to revolt. Thus starts the War for Independence in the New World (American Revolutionary War).

GAMEPLAY
Choosing Sides
In Liberty or Death, you partake in the American Revolutionary War, either as the &amp;quot;rebels&amp;quot; - the American Continental Army or as the &amp;quot;Crown&amp;quot; - the British Royal Army.

Choosing either one of the nations will prompt you to choose the leading Commander-in-Chief:

The Continental Army: Charles Lee, Artemas Ward or George Washington.
The British Royal Army: Henry Clinton, Thomas Gage or William Howe.

Revolutionary Politics
Each turn you will have to balance your treasury for the war effort. Money is provided by each state. The more states that support your cause, the more money will flow in your coffers. Money is spent in paying wages, strengthening the fleet and recruiting new regiments.

Here, if you have a sufficient fleet, you can also command your Navy officer to &amp;quot;control the seas&amp;quot; which is conducting a blockade and privateering against enemy ships. This may result in seized goods that will be added to your treasury. 

The American Revolutionary War in Liberty or Death included everyone except the American Indians: [1] Revolutionary Militia: American supporters but not yet fully supportive of Continental Army (not under your full control) [2] Loyalist Militia: Militia supportive to the Crown [3] French Army: The French will support the American cause after a formal alliance is held. [4] Spanish Army: The Spaniards will support the American cause after a formal alliance is held.

Revolutionary Combat
The Top-down turned based combat introduces units available in the Revolutionary War: Infantry, Guerrilla, Cavalry and Artillery (Engineers). Combat near shores may also be joined by Naval units: Fleet and Fires Ships.

His father is the current King of the Savannah and the young prince is able to frolic the lands at will; jumping on and around other subjects of this animal kingdom. When Simba's father, King Mufasa, is killed and his evil brother Scar takes over the kingdom, Simba is banished from the lands of his birthright and has to grow up fast, honing his skills, for the day of his return.

The Lion King, based on the famous Disney movie, is a platform game where you control Simba - initially as a young cub, and later as an adult lion. The plot of the game follows the plot of the movie. Each of the levels represents a part of the movie. 

As young Simba, you can fight various beasts, such as lizards, by jumping on them. You can also roar to scare some creatures into submission, though every time you roar, you have to wait for your &amp;quot;roar meter&amp;quot; to charge. 

As an adult lion, you can still roar and jump, but now you fight enemies by slashing at them with your claws (if you're skillful enough, you can also grab them and toss them off the screen). 

The game features no in-game save function, and it needs to be replayed from the beginning every time.</resource>

A puzzle game seen from a top-down perspective. The goal of each level is to open the exit by pushing a magic stone on a designated spot. May can also push objects one tile ahead without moving herself. This is often used to get the stone over water that she can't cross herself. May's other ability is to create magic bubbles. She can create bubbles in three different sizes. Bubbles will pop after a certain amount of time, depending on their size. If they pop while next to the stone or another bubble, the stone or bubble will be moved one space. Since May can create several bubbles simultaneously, it is possible, and often necessary, to create chain reactions to maneuver the stone into the desired position.

As the game progresses, levels become increasingly difficult and new hazards and enemies are introduced. Enemies follow a set movement pattern and can sometimes be stopped, but not destroyed by magic bubbles. Later levels are made more complicated by different types of tiles including: grass that slows down May, ice that May and the magic stone will slip over, spikes that destroy the stone if it is pushed into them, collapsing tiles that can only be walked over once, rune tiles on which May cannot create magic bubbles, teleporters and others.</resource>

The first two games, Little Master Raikubaan no Densetsu and Little Master 2: Kaminari Hikari no Kishi, were exclusive to the Game Boy. Set two years after the events of Little Master 2, the heroes - swordsman Riim, minotaur brawler Mormor and healing mage Tamtam - rescue a goatman from a cave-in, which sets off another series of battles against old foes the Skull Bombers and other villains.

The game is structurally similar to Intelligent Systems's Fire Emblem or Camelot's Shining Force series: players move characters around a grid, fighting enemies in range via cutaways that shows the two characters exchanging blows on a 2D plane. Players need to be wary of counterattacks from enemies and getting surrounded by enemy units on the tactical map, as both might lead to an allied character getting eliminated from battle. The player can also investigate houses on the battle map to potentially earn items and recruit new characters.

The offers two difficulties: Normal and Advanced. The main difference is that experience gain is a lot slower on Advanced, forcing the player to consider how to spread around the finite amount of experience between their units. The game was not officially localized, but a few partial fan translations exist.</resource>

Artemiza is a goddess and the daughter of Zeus. She is also the successor to his throne on Mount Olympus. She is very vain and Fiora, the goddess of strife and magic, turns her into the gorgon Medusa. She also makes the other gods believe Artemiza has disappeared. Fiora frees the Titans and takes over the throne. Now Medusa is the only one who can stop her.

The game consists of five worlds with multiple levels and a world ends with a boss fight. Each world is tied to one of the Titans: Ariadne (water), Coeus (wind), Ermolai (earth), Fiora (magic and discord) and Thia (fire). A level consists of a single, fixed screen that is completed once Medusa has collected all yellow stars. She has two lives at the start and there are enemies roaming. She can petrify enemies with her gaze and then push them into the water to create bridges. She can also create stone blocks that serve as obstacles.

Some enemies have attacks and they respawn from pots. Later levels introduce keys, chests, rotatable arrow tiles that change the movement direction of pushed enemies, and additional lives that can be picked up.

The combat features many innovations compared to traditional console RPGs: your position on the battle field is important, and certain techniques can be used only from certain positions, and enemy attacks also affect only specific parts of the field. Out of the seven chapters, some have more battle-oriented gameplay, while others are more devoted to puzzle-solving and information-gathering.

The game is one of the least known Squaresoft products, and was never released outside of Japan.</resource>

Lode Runner Twin: Justy to Liberty no Daibouken is a side-scrolling platform game, adapted for the SNES from the original Lode Runner. However the atmosphere has changed to a lot more cartoonish and happy. Controlling either Justy or Liberty, the player is able to move back and forth, climb ladders, cross ropes and dig holes in some types of surface. The enemies then fall into these holes and the player can walk over them. The goal in each level is to get all the candy.

There is also a battle mode that puts Justy versus Liberty to see who can fetch the most candy.

    <resource id="22d70614148ac67b901a32ca1ad6fab1ac1a806b" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">One of the several video games based on Ryo Mizuno's fantasy novels, this version of Record of Lodoss War does not follow the main plot of the novels, but is instead dedicated to an important episode from the history of Lodoss: the battle of Six Heroes against the demon god. 

The introduction shows the Six Heroes in the middle of this confrontation. Flaus, the priestess of Valis, is slain in battle. The hero Beld, enraged, invokes a demonic power to defeat the god. But when the battle is over, the heroes disappear...

The game begins with Karla the Grey Witch, one of the Six Heroes, alone in a strange place, her powers lost. After completing Karla's scenario, the player is taken to the scenarios of the other heroes, and finally finds out what happened to all of them.

Record of Lodoss War is a Japanese-style RPG with top-down navigation, world map, and randomly appearing enemies. However, the battles have a strategic edge, allowing the characters to move on the battle field freely. The battles take place on an isometric screen. Characters can also acquire unique abilities, such as for example Karla's ability to possess bodies of other people.</resource>

But would would happen if the cartoons were interactive? Well, you might end up with something like Death Valley Rally. The object is pretty simple: Race the Road Runner through each level as quickly as you can while collecting different colored flags, which are worth different amounts of points. When you reach the ending, if you're fast enough, you'll also get a time bonus, but if you're good enough, you'll get a flag bonus. Some of the flags are INCREDIBLY difficult to find, and the fact that you won't usually be able to find them, will challenge (or at least frustrate) most gamers. You can run, turbo run (by stocking up on bird seed), peck, and jump in this wild adventure, as you try to catch the escape the ever-witty Wile E. Coyote and his assorted ACME contraptions.

It's tough work, and afterwards they just want to relax and maybe shoot a few hoops in the parking lot. Of course they can't entirely leave their wild antics inside the studio, and will certainly bring some kind of zany onto the basketball court.

Looney Tunes B-Ball is a 2-on-2 Basketball game, similar to the more well known NBA Jam. However, Looney Tunes is much more informal and silly, though this level of silliness is set by the player via the Wackiness Meter on the main menu. Players choose their teams from the likes of: Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Elmer Fudd, Wile E. Coyote, Tasmanian Devil, Sylvester, Yosemite Sam and Marvin Martian. Each player has unique statistics for their shooting, 3-pointers, defense, stamina and speed.

Once on the court, the player can pass the ball, shoot the ball, grab a burst of speed or unleash a special defensive ability or a special offensive ability.. These abilities include cream pies, time bombs, sticks of dynamite and other fun toys from the ACME Corporation. Offensive Abilities must be &amp;quot;bought&amp;quot; by collecting gems and other items which occasionally show up on the basketball court.

The story of Nobunaga takes place during the Japanese civil war of the 16th century. In a wartime strategy game, 15 different warlords are represented across several territories.

One to eight human players can play, controlling different leaders and factions. Gameplay is done in one of two scenarios; the beginning of the civil war in 1555 or Nobunaga surrounded by his enemies in 1571. Management of population, supplies and military are the gameplay and successful manipulation of these numbers in the right combination to attack and defend against hostile intentions is what will bring your forces to victory.

    <resource id="de7983a2641daeb18ca09b29b49f3c31af36eb82" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">You are a young man who is about to marry his sweetheart Yuka. Everything is prepared for the ceremony, but at the last moment the church is shaken by a mysterious force, and the next thing you know is that your bride has disappeared! Equipped not only with your best weapon and armor, but also with your manly charm, you have to go out to the jungle of modern city, to get Yuka back! I guess it also won't harm if you get acquainted with some pretty ladies on the way, now will it?..

&amp;quot;Love Quest&amp;quot; is a humorous RPG where traditional turn-based, first person perspective combat options are replaced by actions you would normally do to win a girl's attention: you can for example smile, which will cost you MP and inflict big &amp;quot;damage&amp;quot; on the girl, and so on. Your only enemies are girls (including random encounters), and your progress will be determined by your successful fighting. Of course, you also level up, acquire items, better weapons and armor, just like in any &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; RPG. At certain points girls will also join your party, to heal and to support you.

Despite its &amp;quot;suggestive&amp;quot; themes, the game doesn't feature any explicit sex scenes or nudity.</resource>

    <resource id="23526a296d1dac2b75c2df67f99896c2e072043e" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Based on the famous comics series about good cowboy Lucky Luke.

In the game you as Lucky Luke have to arrest four Dalton brothers – Averell, William, Jack, and Joe. On your mission you will progress from level to level shooting bad cowboys, jail-breakers, and bad Indians with your revolver; collecting bullets, dynamites, sheriff stars, and other useful items; running, jumping, ducking, and climbing. The locations vary from Forts, Towns, and Jails to Mines, Train, and Saloon with Ghosts. On every level you have to complete different submissions to progress – either to free a Bank Director, or to collect Three Nuggets for Miner to obtain a Nitroglycerine, or to build a Totem for Apaches, etc. At the end of some levels you confront the big boss, it is often the one of Daltons.

Different arcade sequences between levels allow you to chase the Dalton brothers or train riding your faithful horse Jolly; to run away from Tornado; and to ride on the raft. 

Bonus level arcade sequences represent your wrestling challenge with Jolly, bottles shooting, or revolver's barrel roulette.

To access the one of the three certain parts of the game you may enter password.

The game was made in French/English/German/Spanish.</resource>

You could also gamble away your money in minigames at the casinos found in various towns.

Doom (as portrayed in Lufia II), and all is peaceful.  With such a great peace, the defense forces of the world become lax.  One hundred years later attacks begin taking place, supposedly by the Sinistrals.  It's up to the descendant of the hero, and his childhood friend Lufia, to form a new band of champions to save the world.
     Gameplay is fairly standard for RPGs, with turn-based battling by way of a menu of icons, and random battles.  There's also a higher-than-normal emphasis on puzzles within dungeons.</resource>

It was a bit of a mystery until the rifle and and carts became available through Ebay. The rifle used for the M.A.C.S. is a replica of a Jäger AP 74 (an M16A2 clone). The light gun is far more accurate than the Super Scope and has the weight and feel of an authentic weapon. The gun includes a scope used for aiming, and the light sensor is in the barrel of the gun. The cord that connects to the controller port of the SNES comes out near the end of the barrel.

Unlike Puyo Puyo, Mado Monogatari is a Japanese-style RPG. You play Arle, a five-year old apprentice magician. She is attending a special kindergarten, and it is time for the Final Exam. At the same time, Arle receives a mysterious letter that tells her that if she finds eight magical gems and takes them to the Wizard Mountain, she'll be granted one wish. Arle decides to search for the gems which are scattered all over the world, and to overcome all the obstacles with her great magic power!

The game features random enemy encounters and turn-based combat, which takes place on a platform (Arle to the left, the enemies to the right). You can't perform physical attacks at all, and your only way of harming enemies is through magic. During the game, you learn a variety of magic spells, which can be upgraded later. In battles you can't see your own and the enemies' hit points, and have to act according to your intuition.

To do this, you must defeat his army that stands in your way with whatever weapon you are carrying. Health is decreased by coming into contact with various monsters, attacks, traps, and the passage of time. It is increased by finding food. Every certain amount of points, a &amp;quot;Food Fairy&amp;quot; appears and drops off food as well.

Throughout your journey, you can smash open chests to find treasure and artifacts. Some of these artifacts can be recovered that alter gameplay, such as providing more damage or increased magical power. Also throughout your journey, you can collect keys, which are used to free imprisoned allies, who not only help you defeat monsters, but also leave you an item that will help you on your quest. Only one person can join you at a time.

As you progress through the tower, you will be granted new magical weapons after each boss you defeat. The weapons are affected by a &amp;quot;magic bar&amp;quot; that charges over time. When this bar is fully charged, the weapon has a powerful ranged attack, but when not charged only a close attack is produced. A magical staff will grant increased range attack ability. A magical blast may be generated by jumping and attacking, but doing this costs health.

There are multiple paths in the game, and two separate endings. Hidden doors can be used to skip levels when found - usually by attacking a wall or a particular spot.</resource>

2. Puzzle: You have a limited time to clear a fixed set of balloons before time runs out.

When using magic, Princess will consume star powers.  Different types of magic requires a different number of stars.  Stars can be collected throughout the game and you can also get stars after defeating a foe.  In the first stage you will only have access to Princess' magic beam powers which shoots small beams of laser at enemies.  Later, you will receive the ice, fire and other powers.

The sword can only be used to perform close range slashing against enemies. But it does not cost any stars.

In each stage, Princess will be confronted with a number of enemies that she must fight off to advance.  There are many mini-bosses and at the end of a stage, you will have to fight the main boss.

Princess' health is indicated by the number of hearts she has in her health meter.  There are various items that will help refill the meter: Candy refills half a heart, A slice of cake refills a whole heart and a birthday cake will refill the entire meter.

You will be taken to the game over screen if you lose all your lives.   But, no worries, there's an unlimited number of continues. There is no save feature in the game.</resource>

Mickey's mission is to save his dog Pluto, who's been kidnapped and kept inside emperor Pete's castle, in a magical land, guarded by mysterious creatures. 

The originality of the game lies on the possibility of wearing different costumes to incorporate different characters, all taken from old Disney cartoons. Each one has a special ability. As a wizard, Mickey has magical powers; as a fireman, the mouse can deal with fire; and, as a climber, he can reach the top of high platforms.</resource>

In the game Taru must cross levels in five worlds to reach and defeat Raivar to save Honmaru's girlfriend Iyona. Taru can attack enemies in a level with his tongue, and he can also eat the many takoyaki scattered throughout the level. Takoyaki can also function as platforms, though, so they shouldn't all be eaten. At the end of a level Taru can use the takoyaki he's eaten to purchase temporary power ups. On the worldmap taru can run into friends and enemies who will challenge Taru to minigames. Win and he gains extra takoyaki and powerups.</resource>

One day a young boy named Alex is attacked by four monsters but is saved by a Knight of Anatea. Alex, the son of a shepard, grows up idolizing this knight and once the proper age, wishes to enroll in the Arena tournament, though his family forbids him. Entering the tournament Alex and two other warriors: Gina the Magician and Getz the Mercenary, all are defeated in the first round and sent to the Inn to recuperate. However during their absence, the Demon King plans a surprise attack on the Arena and kills everyone there. As the only surviving warriors from the tournament, Alex, Gina and Getz are mistakingly assumed to be strong enough to withstand monsters, and made knights by the King and given the mission of defeating the Demon King. They set out on an epic journey...

Magna Braban: Henreki no Yusha is a console-style RPG with party-based combat and random enemy encounters. The game's main view is an overhead map of a specific location, such as a town, where the characters move and can interact with NPCs. Upon leaving an area, the view changes to a larger overworld map showing locations of interest. The battles are viewed from an isometric perspective and the characters automatically engage and perform their actions. While the player does not directly control any of the characters, they can pause the battle at time and assign new strategies (such as melee, use long-ranged attacks or use Magic) to each character. Experience points and gold are awarded after each battle, the later of which can be used to purchase equipment and items.</resource>

It plays similarly to other match-3 games of the era, like Columns, in that the player has to line up three identical pieces horizontally, vertically or diagonally. Pieces fall in square clumps of four, sometimes including cloud pieces which immediately vanish, and very rarely including a sun icon that can remove all the icons of a single type.

The game features a competitive two-player mode and a one-player story mode. In the story mode, the player takes on a series of monsters. The monster intermittently casts spells at the player that randomly transforms blocks into &amp;quot;enemy blocks&amp;quot;. By casting magic back at the monster, best done by creating chains and combos, the ground beneath them moves towards the ceiling. Once high enough, the monster is crushed and the player moves onto the next stage.</resource>

It is based on a comedy anime starring the same characters. In this game, the children must defeat the evil demon Giri to save the world.

Battles are fought in real-time with one player controlling two characters. This amounts to lining up the children in such a way that Nike can swing his sword and hit the enemies while Kukuri shoots her magical balls at them at the same time.</resource>

Majin Tensei and its successors put a turn-based strategy twist on the usual Megami Tensei gameplay formula.


In the late 1990s, ethnic battles around the world result in a large amount of deaths and a large portion of the world being closed off. Decades later, in 202X, a boy living in Neider Tokyo in the area D-03 suddenly receives a mysterious Demon Summoning Program on his COMP from someone called TAKEUCHI, with demons appearing immediately after. After fighting his way to a mysterious building, he finds a young woman in cryogenic sleep, who decides to join him. There are 3 possible endings: a bad ending, a normal ending, and the best ending.</resource>

You control a group of three special agents whose task is to stop a demonic invasion from a different reality. You receive missions such as capturing enemy base, exterminating invaders, etc. After you complete a mission, you move to the next one in a linear fashion, without exploration. The gameplay consists of large strategic battles. You move on the battle field, trying to complete your mission and exterminate the demons on your way. Attacking (or being attacked by) a demon results in a short auto-battle sequence.

&amp;quot;Spiral Nemesis&amp;quot; contains many classical Megaten elements, such as demon classification, Light/Dark and Law/Chaos alignment axis, etc.

The Skins game has players compete for prize money on each individual hole.

Match play involves 2 golfers competing to see who can win the most holes out of 9 or 18 holes.

Stroke play counts the total number of strokes over a course of a golf game. The golfer with the least amount of strokes wins.

Tournament mode has golfers competing in either one day (18 holes) or two days (36 holes) of golf. Scoring is figured out by how many strokes over or under par a golfer made to finish a hole.

Gameplay consists of first choosing a golfer type of either a power hitter, all-around, technician, or magician. Each type has its own proficiencies in the drive, power, accuracy, hook, slice, and back spin categories.

When on the golf course the player can choose a club, their stance, direction of where to hit the ball, and the power of the swing. Once that is decided, the swing is determined by a meter which measures the accuracy of the shot and determines whether the ball gets hit straight, hooks, or slices.

This time he's set up his headquarters in Antarctica and created portals to 25 famous cities around the world, so that his Koopas can wreak havoc in our own world. He's also kidnapped Mario, hence the title of this game. You play as Luigi who must foil Bowser's plans by entering through each of the portals, tracking down the Koopas who have stolen famous artifacts, and looking for clues about your location. Once you've set everything right and determined where you are, you call Yoshi on your Globulator so he can track you down. You need Yoshi's help to eat the Pokey (a cactus-like creature) that's guarding the return portal, and when Luigi returns he can close the portal forever.

By exploring these 25 cities, children can familiarize themselves with the landmarks and artifacts that each city has. When Luigi returns the stolen artifacts to the proper places he can even take photographs of them. There is also an add-on disk you can purchase that adds ten additional cities to the game (it originally retailed for $24.95).

    <resource id="c85df56768a880c7b6d4a36d0384378558e601cd" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">A sequel to Mario's Picross on the GameBoy, Mario's Super Picross features the same gameplay as its predecessor. The game is played slab of stone with a grid on it. Above of every column and next to every row are numbers that acts as clues as to where a filled square is located along that column or row. The point of the game is to find all the filled squares on the grid by using your hammer and chiseling out squares that you think are filled and marking those that aren't with X.

There are two different sets of puzzles available but you start off with only one, Mario's Picross, and when you completed the first level, Wario will pop in and offer you his set of puzzles. The difference between the two is that Mario's Picross have to be completed within a certain time. Every time you chisel out the wrong square, it will deduct time. If time runs out before you can solve the puzzle, it's game over. Wario's Picross are timed to see how long it will take you to complete it, but will not run out. The catch here is that you will not be notified of a wrong square.

Other features includes game-saves, hints and tutorials.</resource>

Within these woods lives a sprite, and those who meet it find happiness, or so the tale goes. One day, Mario came to the woods to confirm the legend. Peach and Yoshi should have been together with Luigi......but alas, the visage of Luigi was missing. Mario's group of three have separated to find lost little Luigi.

At once, the suspicious sound of an engine was in the air. I wonder what it could be? It was Wario riding his personal plane, the Bulldog, and it dropped a bucket from the sky.

&amp;quot;Whew, woosh!&amp;quot;

And suddenly, the bucket was a snug fit on Mario's head.

&amp;quot;Uwagh, I can't see in this thing!&amp;quot;

The sprite of the woods, Wanda, witnessed it. The petite pixie did not have the strength to remove the bucket on her own, but she desired to help somehow. Thus, Wanda sends Mario a signal with her magic wand, determined to reunite him with Luigi......</resource>

The game also includes a Parent's Information Center, which explains what each of the activities does and how to complement them. Options to configure the activities to each parent's wishes are also provided.</resource>

With Mario?s help, your child learns to define and identify these subjects without pressure. Your child simply guides Mario, selecting objects on the screen which Mario bonks and bounces through, frequently affirming your child's correct choice. With Mario, Luigi, Princess Toadstool and all their friends as classmates, your child just may make the biggest stride since learning to walk.

That's because MARIO'S EARLY YEARS is all about learning to think in a way that doesn?t seem like learning, but much more like playing. Moms and Dads get to interact and play, too. Mario invites them to join in the fun and observe their kids as they become totally involved in the learning process.</resource>

The gameplay is reminiscent of Super Black Bass.  The player picks a location to fish using an overhead map where the player is then taken to a behind the person perspective to cast their reel.  Once the player casts their line, the view will change to a split screen with the original view on the top with a underwater view on the bottom to view the bait and an approaching fish.

Each lake has a different criteria to meet such as a weight limit, time limit, etc., to advance to the next lake and ultimately compete in the major tournament.  Players can also assemble their own set of authentic fishing gear including rods, reels, bait and various equipment.  The game also boasts that the fish in the game act realistically to their real-life counterparts.</resource>

When Marko's football comes in touch with the substance it gets magical powers, giving Marko the power to stop Colonel Brown.

Now Marko has to find his way through numerous platform levels filled with enemies and obstacles. Using his magic football, he can perform various moves and attacks. He can kill his enemies with different kicks, header shots or even bicycle kicks and also use his ball as a trampoline. 

The SNES version features two additional moves for Marko (the ability to balance on the ball and a different method of returning it to him), but they do not have a great impact on gameplay.

Adam Warlock calls on the heroes to recover the 6 Infinity Gems before they are used for evil.

You may choose ones of five heroes: Spider-Man, Hulk, Captain America, Iron Man and Wolverine.  Each one has different stats and abilities.  (i.e. Spider-Man is agile. Hulk is strong, Iron Man can double-jump with his rocket boots, etc.)  Initially you can choose a training area in Avenger headquarters or four levels.  As you complete levels, most open up.  Each hero can be equipped with gems to boost their abilities in each section.  These must be obtained by finding them in the levels.

Gameplay is fairly similar to X-Men-Mutant Apocalypse.  Combat is all on a 2D plane.  Each hero has basic jumps and attacks and special moves that can be executed with button combinations like quarter-rolls.  Enemies include various villains from the Marvel Universe and evil doubles of various Marvel heroes.</resource>

    <resource id="3fd18e6a609bc6725b764cfbf3004514596c85bd" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Based of the 1994 movie remake of Frankenstein, the player is the artificial man created by Victor Frankenstein. After Victor rejects his creation due to its hideous appearance, the creation flees from Victor and swears revenge on him.

The player goes through a number of levels, battling anything that attacks with a wooden stick. It's possible to set the tip of the stick on fire, by swinging it at the fire torches located on the walls. The player can also use a special attack: a blue ball coming out of the hands of the creation, which takes some of the player's life away. There are also some simple puzzles to be solved in order to get through the levels.</resource>

He battles through levels inspired by the movie, including his apartment, the city streets, the bank, the park, the jail, and the night club for the final showdown.</resource>

You find yourself in the middle of the Tokyo district Akihabara. But is this really Akihabara? The buildings have turned into ruins, and you wander around the deserted streets without any idea of how you could possibly be in such a place. A strange giant head appears in front of you, and defeats you in battle. When you wake up, you find out that Japan is floating in the air, and is attacked by a mysterious force that spawned countless demons who brought destruction to the cities. People are hiding among rubble and in underground passages. Some of them are fighting the demons, joining an organization called Self-Defense Forces. The hero's first objective is to find a way to his home district Shinjuku, where he will obtain more information about the power that threatens Japan, and discover mysterious artifacts from an unknown civilization, called ooparts (out-of-place artifacts).

You can play as either one of the five characters presented to you in the beginning of the game: Rage, Rai, Hokuto, Seigi, and Daigo, each one having his own initial strengths and weaknesses. The entire game plays from first-person perspective. You navigate a cursor over the city map and check out your radar device to find out places of interest. The claustrophobic, extremely complex first-person 3D dungeons have a distinct Shin Megami Tensei flair. The battles are random and turn-based. Your main character doesn't gain levels, but instead accumulates energy points which can be then distributed freely to raise his strength, mental power, defense, etc. Certain characters join your party later in the game, and there are also friendly demons who would join you if you choose a correct way of behavior when you encounter them.</resource>

The game allows students to practice basic addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division skills in addition to fractions, decimals, percents, estimation, and number patterns. The subjects can be practiced separately or together in review. Six levels of difficulty are provided. Like the previous titles, the game also includes an editor to create new problem sets (present in the PC version only).

Math Blaster's friend and assistant, Spot, is kidnapped by the evil Trash Alien at the beginning of the game. The Galactic Commander gives Math Blaster the mission to follow the Trash Alien to his home planet and rescue Spot.

The game starts with a complete mission (story mode). The mission consists of a series of four (three in the console versions) math activities (mini-games) strung together with cut-scenes. The activities can also be played separately, for practice or for score.

The activities are as follows:

1. Trash Zapper - Solve equations to gain tractor beam power, then use the tractor beam to collect space trash.

2. Number Recycler (PC version only) - Create equations by pushing around columns of numbers and operators. Correct equations allow you to turn the trash you collected into fuel.

3. Cave Runner - Use Math Blaster's jet pack to fly through a cave. He has a number on his chest, and it must be arithmetically between the numbers on each side of an opening in order for him to pass through. Droplets of water falling from above can change this number by performing an operation on it. There are also gems which can be collected for bonus points, and in higher levels, monsters appear that can knock Math Blaster down.

4. Math Blaster - The Trash Alien's spaceship displays an equation, and the four portholes serve as multiple-choice answers. Use the jet pack to fly into the correct portholes while avoiding floating trash and energy blasts from the ship. Bonus gems also appear at random, and after five problems a bonus round occurs where players get a chance to collect as many gems as they can within a time limit.

Upon finishing the complete mission, the player is presented with a certificate that can be printed out (PC version only). Their final score is also added to a high score board for their account.</resource>

Animated cutscenes between levels tell the story of the game.

The Mazinger Z comes with a full armory of anti-robot weaponry, from super-powered karate moves to missiles, Breast Fire, and its signature Rocket Punch. Special moves deplete a regenerating energy meter, while Rocket Punches can be preformed at any time, although Mazinger will be unable to punch until its arms return. Each level contains several varieties of enemies, all of them from the show and unique to each level, that must be defeated to progress. Some enemy robots will fire projectiles from a distance while others will rush in attempt to grapple the Mazinger, and sometimes more than one enemy must be fought at once. Enemies will drop healing items and occasionally an item that upgrades Mazinger's Rocket Punch to the Iron Cutter for a limited time. At the end of each level is a fight with a stronger boss robot with more dangerous attacks.</resource>

The player doesn't get to play as the robot, instead they attempt to beat the robot in a standard 18 rounds of regular golf including weather conditions and obstacles such as sand traps, bunkers, water hazards and trees.  Players can also practice their swing on the Driving Range to learn the basics of the game.</resource>

While you were away, unknown attackers destroyed your home, killed your entire family, and stole the Chalice that you need to win the throne. When you are implicated in your own family's death, you are forced into exile. With a help of an old friend who contributed an old Jenner and some credits, you must become a mercenary. You must travel the Inner Sphere in search of clues to who set you up, and eventually avenge your family and recover the Chalice. You have five years. Good luck and good hunting. 

Mechwarrior was the first 3D BattleTech game developed. Dynamix (who later developed the Starsiege series) created it for Activision. You go to a planet and in search of &amp;quot;fixers&amp;quot; who will set up some contracts with the local authorities. The terms are a flat payment and some salvage payments. Some houses are very stingy but they tell you a lot about the mission. Others pay well but may not tell you everything. You can buy/sell/repair 'Mechs, hire/fire pilots, decide which planet to move to, as you try to maintain decent relationships with all five houses of the Inner Sphere, while trying to uncover clues about where you need to go. This ground-breaking game is very replayable, as each mission is randomly generated. There's even some extended campaigns where you run 2-3 missions in a row. 

(The following is the plot from the SNES version of Mechwarrior.)
You are Herras Ragen. When you were 12 (3017) your father Colonel Joseph T. Ragen, a soldier in the House Davion army, was working to infiltrate and destroy a renegade mercenary cartel called the Dark Wing Lance and he had got in over his head.  Somehow the members of the cartel got the location of your family's house on Redondo leaked to them from an unknown source. Before making their covert strike the lance made an agreement that they would separate for 10 years and maintain an absolute code of secrecy before regrouping again to continue their nefarious operations.

One night the Lance attacked your families home killing everyone inside.  Over at a friend's you heard sounds of explosions. Rushing home you found a roaring inferno of what used to be the home you grew up with your family. Newly orphaned you vowed revenge on whoever had done this.

The year is 3027. Now a young man, you cannot serve House Davion after what happened all those years ago. Now you make your living working as a freelance Mercenary on the planet Galatea selling your services to anyone whose contract will lead you closer to the insidious Dark Wing Lance.</resource>

With this defeat, Wily was thrown in jail, seemingly for good. The world would no longer be subject to his madness.

But remember, Dr. Wily is mad, but he's not stupid. He had a backup plan...and all he had to do was just wait...

6 months had passed, and somewhere from deep within Wily's abandoned lab, 4 hidden capsules activated and opened. His backup plan was in action...he had hidden 4 new Wily Robots that would spring him out of jail so he could continue his mad reign.

When Mega Man hears the word that Wily was busting out of prison, he rushes onto the scene, only to encounter a strange robot he had never seen before named Bass. Bass tells Mega Man to back off, that he would stop Wily, and that Mega Man was no longer needed.

Think that's gonna stop Mega Man? No way! Mega Man takes off to put a stop to Dr. Wily and find out exactly whose side Bass is on...</resource>

Dr. Light immediately responds by forming a soccer team of Mega Mans to counter Dr. Wily's latest scheme.

Mega Man Soccer is an overhead view soccer game featuring characters from the Mega Man series. Players begin by selecting either Exhibition, Tournament, League or Capcom Championship modes. Depending on the mode, a team must be formed using either all of one type of robot, or a mixture of different types assigned to different positions on the field. In any case, each soccer team has 8 players on the field including the goalie. The goal of each team is to score on the net of the opposing team, earning points to win the game. The action follows the ball as it is tossed around the field from player to player. Once a player's team member has the ball they can choose to pass it to another teammate, shoot the ball straight ahead or perform a clearing kick (if the goalie). If the player does not have the ball, they are given control of the nearest player to the ball and can slide tackles or shoulder tackles to try to gain possession. Each type of robot has a special move that can be initiated.</resource>

The game is split into 10 levels - the first 9 are groups of 3 territories which can be completed in any other, while the final 'Mother of All Battles' has its own surprises. 

Land is mostly of sand, grass or ice. You start with 100 men and you can use whatever quantity you find necessary on each island. The rest men left will go to another level with another new 100. In the second half of the game you can freeze men to save them for the Mother of All Battles.
 
Once you select your island and place for your HQ, you must do some research for better weapons and defences. On the roof of your buildings you can put protectors like archers, gunmen, boiling oil men, and later on even laser turrets. If you send a team of unarmed men into an unoccupied square, they will build an additional base there, with larger armies completing this more quickly.

Later on higher levels, you'll also build mines and factories, as you'll need to dig a certain material for higher level weapons, depending on whether the area you're on is rich with a certain material or not. With each next level, you'll start from a higher technology level and be able to progress to one higher level up then the at previous level.

If there is more then just one enemy, you can make an alliance until you crush the other one - three of you can form an alliance against fourth enemy. For what its worth, a certain numeric level of defence is always stronger from the same level of attacker, and men that are not armed (conscripts) can only kill enemy soldiers, not destroy or attack enemy fort.

The main thing as it always is in strategy games is to be the sole survivor and lead your men to victory, experimenting on vicious technologies, equipping your men, making a perfect soldiers out of them, produce shields, weapons, planes... to dominate the world and crush your opponents. 

You can do the battling only in a certain quadrant, but don't be long as your men will automatically start building the fort, and it will be at the bottom of age level and you'll need to invent everything for that one again.

But the world did not return to peace and instead new Chiefs and new machines rose up to rule the world. Like before, the Chiefs use giant robots known as Standing Tanks (STs). Seeing the world in trouble, the hero pilots who had defeated the Battle Chiefs decide to once again enter the Battle Game using an improved version of their ST, the Falcon. The truth behind the Battle Game will take the Falcon deep into space...

Metal Combat: Falcon's Revenge is a first person shooter designed for the Super Scope Light Gun. Gameplay is identical to Battle Clash. The player takes the role of the gunner of the giant robot, movement is handled automatically by the game, scrolling the screen. Players must keep the enemy robot in the gunsights and blast away at different parts of it, while also intercepting enemy missiles and counter-attacks. All robots have a weak point that will increase the damage done to them. Power-ups such as Neutron Beams and Plasma Bombs can be picked up following the completion of certain stages, and equipped at the beginning of combat.

The once great continents have been drastically changed into thousands of tiny islands and various cities have washed into the oceans.  During this turmoil,  Zorgeuf the Great rushes to conquer the bewildered world along with a troop of commanders and declares the Earth Empire. The only hope to defeat him lies from without Earth, as the Colonial Forces send a command carrier from the major orbital base. With so many armies gone, the ground infantry unit has been replaced by the Metal Marine, a fifty foot armored robot that can be sent into battle for attack or defense. From their respective Command Center, each side in the conflict will need to direct the placement of facilities on the ground to defend against enemy attack, manage resources and successfully strike the enemy.

Metal Marines is an isometric strategy game. Controlling one side of a conflict, the player must wage a campaign across several islands to defeat Zorgeuf and his lieutenants. The player controls logistics of the base to ensure that there are the necessary assets to wage war. On each map, the player places three underground command bases, if all of these are destroyed the battle is lost.  The player must manage the resources of their money to construct new buildings or upgrade existing facilities on the map. Different buildings include Energy Plants, Factories, Economic Centers, Radar systems, Anti-Aircraft missiles, fake buildings and fake HQ bases, mine fields, gun pods, missile launchers, metal marine hangers and even ICBMs.  At any time, the player may order an attack and choose which assets to fire at the opponent. Missiles, Metal Marines carriers and ICBMs all use different levels of fuel. Metal Marines once deployed in an area will automatically fire rifles at nearby targets or engage even closer targets in melee attacks. Gunpods, while stationary, will also fire on nearby enemies. Metal Marines are largely autonomous but can be manually controlled to a minor degree (directional) by the player.</resource>

    <resource id="216c9690ddce906807ae0309d1269133bfc4d6fc" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">This is a sequel to Metal Max. The game is set in a futuristic world. An evil organization known as the Grapplers terrorizes the world, destroying entire cities if they notice a sign of resistance. The elders of Mado City invited four famous monster hunters to defend the city against the Grapplers. One of the hunters, Maria, brought a friend with her - this friend is you, the hero of the game. But even the hunters can't withstand the Grapplers' assault. Their leader, the giant machine-like Ted Broiler, kills Maria. You are left on your own, and you decide to fight the Grapplers and to become a hunter yourself.

The game is a Japanese-style RPG with random encounters and turn-based combat viewed from third-person perspective, like in Final Fantasy games. There are two kinds of combat in the game: standard character-to-character combat, and vehicle battles. vehicles can be purchased, equipped, and modified just like the characters themselves. Various vehicles have different special attacks, and there are plenty of items to collect that will upgrade and repair your vehicles. As a hunter, you can also hunt down various giant monsters that populate the world, and kill them for a reward.</resource>

You are a little boy who lives with his father in a town in a futuristic world dominated by machines. Your wish is to become a &amp;quot;hunter&amp;quot; - to kill monsters that roam the world and to receive rewards for that. The storyline and the gameplay basics remained unchanged in this remake. You fight enemies in turn-based combat, and use vehicles, such as your own personal tank Mosquito, to transport yourself through different areas, and to participate in battles. You can also buy equipment and upgrade your vehicles.

The remake features enhanced graphics and sound, background pictures for battles (they were black in the original), slightly different locations (more houses in towns, sometimes different layout of the towns and of the world map), and reduced difficulty level.</resource>

As their ambassador, they choose to send the Metal Morph, a being made from living metal, as he is the only being that can survive the inter-dimensional travel.  The people of Earth have created a Hypergate, which links the two galaxies together.  Upon arriving at the alien destination, the Metal Morph is quickly ambushed and is taken to an alien lab for study so that they can travel through the Hypergate themselves.  The Metal Morph quickly escapes and begins to get back to his sabotaged ship...

Metal Morph is a side-scrolling platformer.  As the Metal Morph, you can jump, duck and shoot, as well as transform into an invulnerable liquid blob of metal.  While as a blob, you can also travel through pipes to get to areas you couldn't normally.  Power ups such as triple shots and homing missiles make battle easier for you.

The game also has sections where you fly your spaceship to track down your stolen pods.  In flight mode, you can move the ship up, down, left and right while shooting enemies and dodging their incoming shots.  Power ups such as speed up (which makes the ship travel faster to its destination) and shields (which prevent instant death) can also be found.</resource>

It appeared on various Sega systems and the Amiga, though they cancelled the snes version. It is a simple platform shooter game. The game was shown at the Winter 1993 CES.

A prototype rom image of this game shows that it was at a beta state at the very least for the snes. When you first load the rom, there is a bunch of debug stuff, which allows you to choose various levels. The levels seem to be pretty much complete, but there isn't really much you can do. Most enemies are static and do not harm your character. You can also use the L button to float around the levels, which is very necessary since pits do not kill you. Pressing the R button skips you to the bonus stages for each level.</resource>

    <resource id="c8802d1e5c6664b2cdae5bb894268e38746de2da" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">One night, as Mickey (or Minnie) lay in bed reading a book of fairy tales, he started to wonder how it would be to live in a far off land, in a magic castle. As he fell asleep, he woke up in the Kingdom of Beanwick, which is constantly tormented by earthquakes. Then, he offers his help to solve the mystery behind those earthquakes.

Mickey's Ultimate Challenge is a puzzle game in which the player chooses either Mickey or Minnie to play with. They'll find five characters from the Disney's universe in the kingdom, and will be prompted to help them in several tasks.

Each task is a different puzzle, given by a specific character. Daisy, for instance, will ask help to clean the castle's paintings hanging on a wall. The task is in fact a memory game, where Mickey or Minnie must clean the pictures matching pairs. After completing one task, they'll receive a gift.

After completing all tasks, Mickey or Minnie must trade the gifts they won with the right characters. For instance, after finishing Goofy's task, they will receive his hammer. The player must then guess who among the other characters would like to receive that hammer.

Giving the right items to the right characters will allow Mickey or Minnie access to the last puzzle and character.</resource>

    <resource id="0ba7fefcc70509f0a2efa06fdadd6774bd2a1293" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">If you're bored of racing Formula 1 cars, rally cars or MotoGP bikes in their natural habitats, the Micro Machines series could be for you. It involves racing miniatures representing particular vehicle types across a particular terrain found around the house. The Sports Cars race on the desktop, 4x4s in the sandpit, Formula 1 cars on a snooker table, and so on.

These levels were packed with variation. The Snooker tables has the track painted on, although this is open to deviation (as are most levels), and had you racing through the pockets and across the rim of the table. Tanks raced as well, with the chance of shooting out your opponent if they got directly in front of you. The desktop levels include binders to jump across, pencil-sharpeners to avoid, and lots of visual jokes in the open homework.

Viewed from overhead with small graphics, the races include up to 4 cars. In one player challenge mode you race through the 21 tracks in a set order, selecting your 3 opponents as you go along (adding a fair amount of strategy - ideally you should aim to eliminate the better CPU cars early on), eliminating one after every third race (assuming that you can finish in the top 2 of a race within your 3 lives). If you win 3 races in a row without using a continue you get a time-trial race which can earn you an extra life.

The real innovation of the game was in the multiplayer modes. You started with 4 points each, and when one car gets far enough ahead to force the other car off-screen, the slider moves in their favour. Once it reached the end (which involved beating them 4 times more than they beat you) you win the level, although if 3 laps were completed, the person leading at that point is declared the winner - with a sudden death play off if scores are level. 9 of the tracks are available in this mode, although you can also play this Head to Head system as a 1-player game across all the tracks.</resource>

In this game, you can choice among 8 playable characters: the Power Rangers' Zords (Thunder Megazord, Mega Tigerzord, Ninja Megazord, Shogun Megazord) or some of their known villains (Lipsyncher, Silver Horns, Goldar, Lord Zedd). The title offers 3 game modes: Story Mode (1-Player only), Fighting Mode (2-Player) and Trial Mode (a survival mode for 1-Player only).

During Story Mode, the goal is to defeat all the 4 Zords, the 4 villains up to Lord Zedd and last, but not least, Ivan Ooze. In this mode, you can opt by the Thunder Megazord (formed by the 5 original Rangers) or by the Mega Tigerzord (formed in conjunction with the White Ranger). The Fighting Mode is an traditional 2-Player head-to-head combat, where you can choose any of the 4 Zords or even the 4 villains. Trial Mode is a Endurance-like option, and the main goal is to win as many battles as possible using only 1 health bar (that will be partially replenished after each battle).

As well as many fighting games, you can take advantage of a Power Bar (here, it fills automatically): if you execute a Super Move when this bar is flashing, it will be cause more damage, besides increasing 1 level. Once you having reached its maximum status, it's possible to execute power-up versions of Special Moves or even unleash high-damage blows (Super Moves).

There are six different levels to play in each with their own standard obstacles and enemies, mid-level bosses and of course end bosses that range from Mordant, Lord Zedd to Ivan Ooze himself.  There are no weapons that can be used, instead the player must rely on kicks and punches to dispatch enemies and pick up health items left behind.

Additionally, the Yellow, Black, Pink Rangers are extremely fast and can jump into higher areas but are more weaker than Blue, Red, White Rangers who are much stronger, but lack the speed and jumping abilities of the other Rangers.  Players can refill their health by picking up heart icons and power icons to increase their morphing meter.  Once filled, the morphing meter will increase the Rangers power, attack capabilities, speed and jumping abilities.

This makes Mini Yonku Let's &amp; Go!! the rare case of a game based on an anime based on a manga based on a toyline.

The story of Power WGP 2 (WGP stands for World Grand Prix) has the TRF Victorys team take on other Mini Yonku teams from across the globe. The game itself is a top-down R.C. car racing game in the vein of a Micro Machines or R.C. Pro Am.

The game was released simultaneously as a retail game and one of the games distributed digitally via the Nintendo Power service.</resource>

It was exclusive to the Japanese Super Famicom.

The cars are actually Mini Yonku: a brand of toy car produced by Tamiya Corporation. These cars are usually battery-powered and are greatly scaled down versions of real vehicles. Shining Scorpion is the first Super Famicom game to use the license, but the third to appear on a Nintendo console.

The game specifically uses the Let's &amp; Go! license, a manga written with the Mini Yonku toyline in mind. This serial manga features two brothers, Retsu and Go, who get involved in the world of Mini Yonku racing when the inventor Dr. Tsuchiya gives them two powerful prototype models. Let's &amp; Go would also be the basis for this game's follow-up, the 1998 SFC game Mini-Yonku Let's &amp; Go!! Power WGP 2, as well as two Game Boy games.</resource>

The game was published by Carrozzeria and an unknown developer: the title screen credits Yuzo Kashiro and his development studio Ancient, though it's not clear if they created the game or simply contributed to the music design.

The player and four opponents move around a board after rolling dice, acquiring casinos along the way. Occasionally, the player will take part in gambling activities like roulette and blackjack. At the end of the game, the player with the highest earnings wins.</resource>

Miracle Girls is based on the characters of the manga and anime of the same name. The player starts the game by picking either Tomomi or Mikage, although they both have the same abilities. Either can jump or toss candy, which will render enemies harmless for a few seconds as they eat it. Enemies incapacitated in this way can be used as platforms. Hidden in levels are bombs that fill the screen with candy, turning any onscreen enemies into heart rings, fruit that increase health, and doors that lead to a celestial slot machine that can reward additional lives. At the end of each level is a different challenge with a boss, such as a top-down squirt-gun fight or a game of matching cards.</resource>

Four youkai are sent out by the King of the Netherworld to keep the other rowdy youkai in check. Up to four players can take control of the four youkai, which include: a hitotsume-kozou, or cyclops boy; a kasa-obake, or umbrella poltergeist; a yuki-onna, or snow woman; and a kappa.

The game follows the blueprint of the Dokapon series, with the player(s) moving around a board occasionally earning money and fighting other youkai in automatic RPG battles. The money can be spent on acquiring new items, and these items can also be acquired by moving around the board. Multiple boards are linked together with teleportation gates, though enemies grow increasingly more powerful the further the player goes: some time spent leveling up on an easier board is recommended.

The eponymous Shigeru Mizuki is the manga artist who lent his artwork to the game. Considered an expert on youkai and Japanese mythological creatures, Mizuki is perhaps better known as the creator of the GeGeGe no Kitarou franchise.</resource>

As was the case with its predecessor, the player can explore a hub area (this time the Boardwalk Hotel) that leads to various Monopoly games, as well as areas that allow players to learn the history of the board game or its rules. There is also a Monopoly quiz the player can try. Players earn tokens as they win games, which unlock higher stakes games and more difficult opponents.</resource>

    <resource id="c2504d65db8b3ab8fd942168ff9c5e6d0463e00d" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">The hero of the game is Fron, a sixteen-year old boy who lives on the island of Monstania. One day, strolling in the forest, he notices a strange light. The light lead him to a clearing, and then suddenly disappeared. But Fron realized what was the meaning of that light - it was a fairy! Of course, everybody knew that fairies had been long extinct, but Fron never believed in that. All his life he wanted to meet a real fairy, and now, when the opportunity has come, he firmly decides to find her. His girlfriend Tia helps him on the dangerous journey, during which they meet a mysterious little girl named Chitta, and get involved in a grand adventure, that will ultimately lead them to the battle against the dark force that threatens the whole Monstania!

&amp;quot;Monstania&amp;quot; has a somewhat unusual gameplay within the frames of console RPGs. You don't explore the world in the game: it is entirely linear and takes you to the next destination by itself (only at a few points you can choose where to go next by selecting an appropriate answer). Once within the location, you cannot leave it until you complete all your objectives there, which then take you to the next location. The objective is usually a large strategic battle. You navigate your party members on the battle field, attack with melee and long-ranged weapons, and use special technique which require action points. Unlike most other turn-based strategy games, an enemy makes a move immediately after you did the same with one of your characters, without waiting for the &amp;quot;enemy turn&amp;quot;. The RPG element is not very significant: your characters level up automatically after each battle. There are also some puzzles to solve in certain locations.</resource>

With this third game, Sofel built a standard RPG from the setting and lore from the Monster Maker franchise.

The Super Famicom saw one more Monster Maker game from Sofel: Monster Maker Kids, which plays more like a board game. The previous two Sofel Monster Maker games were Game Boy exclusives.</resource>

Shang was accompanied by Prince Goro, a warrior of the Shokan race (a four armed half-human/half-dragon). Knowing that if ten tournaments in a row were won by the Outworld champion, the Earth Realm would be conquered by evil and fall into darkness, Shang entered Goro in the tournament and had him defeat the great Kung Lao. Goro has been  reigning supreme as the undefeated fighting champion for five hundred years now. As the last tournament required draws near, Raiden, Thunder God and protector of the Earth Realm, enacts a plan to tip the scales in the humans favor, Seven fighters step into the arena on Shang Tsung's mysterious island: Shaolin warrior Liu Kang, Special Forces operative Sonya Blade, the mercenary thug Kano, fame-seeking actor Johnny Cage, the ice wielding Lin Kuei warrior Sub-Zero and his undead adversary Scorpion, and Raiden himself.

Mortal Kombat is a side-scrolling 1 on 1 fighting game. Fighting is set as one on one kombat, allowing each player to perform a variety of punches, kicks, and special moves in order to defeat their opponent.  When the opponent faces their second round loss, the winner can perform a finishing move called a &amp;quot;Fatality&amp;quot; on the loser.  The Fatality is a move unique to each fighter that graphically kills the loser in a blood-soaked finale.

Mortal Kombat began its life as a 2-player arcade title. It is notable for its use of digitized actors to represent the game's fighters, as well as its use of copious amounts of blood during gameplay.</resource>

In order to revive his Queen Sindel, the emperor Shao Kahn used the Outworld Tournament from Mortal Kombat 2 as a diversion while his Shadow Priests revive his fallen Queen on Earth. Once enacted, the dimensional bridge between the two realms connects, allowing Kahn's extermination squads to invade and destroy Earth, and enslave the population's souls.

A small team of Raiden's &amp;quot;Chosen Warriors&amp;quot; survives the attack: Mortal Kombat champion Liu Kang and his ally Kung Lao, Special Forces agents Sonya Blade and Jax, the shaman Nightwolf, the riot cop Stryker, the nomadic Kabal, and former Lin Kuei warrior Sub-Zero, who has gone rogue from his clan. Facing the warriors are the mercenary Kano, cyber-ninjas Smoke, Sektor and Cyrax, Sheeva, a female Shokan, the sorcerer Shang Tsung, and Queen Sindel herself.

Mortal Kombat 3 brings new elements to the 2D fighting series: multi-level playfields, &amp;quot;Dial-A-Combo&amp;quot; attacks, a &amp;quot;Run&amp;quot; button to speed up the battles, and &amp;quot;Vs.&amp;quot; codes, which unlock new powers and abilities once both players enter a code sequence in pre-match-up screens. Also included are more stage fatalities and finishing moves as each warrior attempts to go one-on-one with the Centaurian enforcer Motaro, and Shao Kahn himself.

Mortal Kombat 3 is the last traditional one-on-one fighting game game in the series to feature motion-captured digitized graphics for its kombatants, and introduces online network play to the PC version.</resource>

To win the main tournament, the player must beat each of the other human players, before taking on Shang Tsung, Kintaro and finally Shao Kahn.

    <resource id="f829f036944aa3be89322b6d9de36e2a2afd1df4" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Set partly in modern-day world and partly in a fantasy medieval Japan, the game is based on the manga/animé series Madara. Loosely connected to Buddhist and local Japanese myths, it tells the story of Madara, the son of the evil Emperor Miroku. An ancient prophecy said that a young warrior with tremendous powers will dethrone Miroku, and for fear of his son's might he ordered to cut his body into eight pieces. Raised with artificial limbs, Madara soon discovered his true origin and   understood he was destined to bring down his father. 

The game puts you in the role of a teenager named Kamishiro, who lives in modern-day Japan. One day he and his girlfriend Subaru venture into a mysterious shrine on the outskirts of their home town, and Kamishiro met the princess Sakuya, who explained to him that he must travel to a different world and to help Madara to get rid of Miroku. During his travels Kamishiro meets many characters from the original manga story, including Madara's brother and rival, Kage-Ou, and discovers the secret connection between the two worlds.

The game is a console-style RPG with random battles. The combat system is turn-based, but the battles are set in auto mode, and you must pause them in order to assign commands to your characters. The battles are viewed from a dynamic third-person perspective, and the characters move around the battle field when executing their attacks. You can also change formation of your party, and use a variety of magic spells.

However, there are numerous bad guys out to get him! Mr. Do can defend himself from the badguys in two ways: first he can push the apples located throughout the playfield on top of the enemies and crush them. Secondly, Mr. Do is armed with a power ball. This can be thrown to destroy an enemy. Mr. Do has only one power ball, though, so he will need to wait for it to return to him before it can be used again. From time to time an alpha monster will appear on the screen bearing one of the letters in EXTRA. If you use the power ball to destroy an alpha monster you earn that letter; when you've earned the complete word EXTRA you receive an extra life. When you successfully collect all of the cherries, you will move on to the next, more difficult level.

The mobile version of the game includes the original arcade version, as well as an enhanced mode with new levels, power-ups and graphics.</resource>

The game was done by the same people as Super SWIV, and as such, the graphics are incredibly polished. The game was apparently too ambitious, and was never fully complete (although the game engine and graphics certainly indicate that it is close).
The game follows a demolition robot known as Mr. Tuff. After the entire population of earth escapes to the planet Utopia, the army robots take over the world. It is up to Mr. Tuff to save the world for the peaceful domestic robots. The levels involve standard platform action, though there are a few shooter-esce hoverboard levels. Each world is set up into standard levels and a boss level.</resource>

This sequel continued on the &amp;quot;eat the dots/avoid the ghosts&amp;quot; gameplay of the original game, but added new features to keep the title fresh.

Like her boyfriend, Ms. Pac-Man attempts to clear four various and challenging mazes filled with dots and ever-moving bouncing fruit  while avoiding Inky, Blinky, Pinky and Sue, each with their own personalities and tactics.  One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Ms. Pac-Man.

Ms. Pac-Man can turn the tables on her pursuers by eating one of the four Energizers located within the maze. During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Ms. Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points (ranging from 200, 400, 800 and 1600, progressively). The Energizer power only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghost's eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Ms. Pac-Man again.

Survive a few rounds of gameplay, and the player will be treated to humorous intermissions showing the growing romantic relationship between Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man, leading all the way up to the arrival of &amp;quot;Junior&amp;quot;.</resource>

The first mention of Muhammad Ali Boxing was at the Summer CES in 1993. It is not clear why this game did not get released, but it perhaps was due to Virgin's focus on the Genesis version (which happened with Mick and Mac, also unreleased on the SNES).

A prototype ROM image exists for this game. It is unknown what the source of it is. The prototype is a relatively early version of the game. The graphics are largely the same between the boxers (the head sprite is different in the boxer selection screen, but nothing is different during actual gameplay). The game seemed to feature an interesting rotating boxing ring. There are no sounds in the game, aside from an announcer at the title screen. The gameplay is not very polished, and computer opponent usually beats you within seconds. There are no visual clues as to what causes the TKO, aside from the TKO meter that is not necessarily depleted when you lose.</resource>

It was first released on the PC-98 computer in 1994 and ported to the Super Famicom two years later.

The player's character washes up on a desert island when their flight crashes into the ocean. They must carefully ration out the water and food they recovered from the crash while exploring the island for more resources and other survivors. Much of the game is spent exploring zones and recovering food and water, though there are also encounters with NPCs that lead to conversations and can possibly end with the NPC joining the player's group. These NPCs then appear and talk to the player while exploring the island.

Mujintou Monogatari was followed by several sequels. The original computer version includes nude scenes of its female characters, though these scenes were edited out of the Super Famicom version.</resource>

Amusement Leasing Co. for the SNES platform. It plays like a combination of Tetris and Qix, with the player attempting to trace the outline of falling shapes before the screen fills up with them and causes the game to end. If every side of an object has a red outline, left by travelling around its circumference, the object vanishes and adds to the player's score, as well as dropping any objects sitting on top of it. The player has access to a single-use emergency satellite, which instantly eliminates everything within one third of the screen.

The game has a sci-fi theme, with a brief intro animation of the player's starship warping into a star system to begin the stage. The game was never released outside of Japan.</resource>

Seven heroes who were brought to a mysterious temple on a remote island and transformed into statues. Seven heroes who are chosen to bring harmony back to the universe: Miriene the witch (wizard), Lux the tetsujin (a race of iron people), Reeshina the grappler (monk), Tokio the ninja, Kamio the ogre, and Mesia the priestess. The seventh hero is you, the protagonist of the game - the knight Remeer or the female warrior Ferris. Your first task will be to release your companions from the statues they are locked in. You must travel to the Cat World and to retrieve an important artifact. But your main objective is to visit all the seven Worlds and to find seven mystic arks - the items that will re-unite those Worlds and bring peace to them.

&amp;quot;Mystic Ark&amp;quot; is a RPG closely connected to  7th Saga. You travel on overworld map, visit towns, buy equipment, and descend into dungeons. The combat is turn-based and viewed from a third-person &amp;quot;over-the-shoulder&amp;quot; perspective. The battles are not random: the enemies can be seen as white dots on your radar, and if you don't want to fight, you can sometimes outrun or avoid them. The game also contains elements of pure adventure: often you must investigate objects closely and use items from your inventory on them.</resource>

The game is different from usual basketball games of the era because it is played in a vertical view. Most basketball games previously had a side scrolling or isometric view. Building upon this technique, the game features large player sprites and graphics. The game features the NBA roster from 1995 complete with player ratings. Gameplay consists of true 5 on 5 basketball but in a more arcade like style with alley-oops and high flying dunks. The audio includes action oriented commentary, in the style of NBA Jam.

Gameplay is fast and action-packed, with few rules, no fouls, and deliberately unrealistic jamming. Players are rated on eight ability categories, from steals and blocks, to dunks and 3-pointers.

Up to four human players can take part, each always controlling a single player for their team, and AI for missing players. This allows for four players to face each other in teams of two, or for two players to team up against a third player with a CPU team-mate.

The Tournament Edition ups each team's roster to three players, and allows for substitutions between quarters. Shoving players now results in injuries, which lower a player's stats; encouraging you to sub them out and let them recover. Aside from the usual secret characters and cheat modes, the T.E. also includes four new additions you can individually enable from the special options menu:

1. &amp;quot;Hot Spots&amp;quot; are randomized zones on the court that reward extra points (up to a 9-point shot!) for making a basket while standing within them.

Powerup icons appear randomly, and convey temporary arcade-like benefits when picked up. Some examples are instant &amp;quot;on-fire,&amp;quot; enhanced 3-point accuracy, monster dunks from anywhere on the court, or a bomb that knocks all other players to the ground.

&amp;quot;Juice Mode&amp;quot; increases the speed of the game up to 4x.

&amp;quot;Tournament Mode&amp;quot; disables all other modes, special characters, and cheats, and challenges you to defeat all the NBA teams to unlock extra players (2 extra players for almost every team). Winning Tournament Mode also unlocks a higher CPU difficulty level.

You not only coach from the sidelines, you also control all the movements of the players on the field. Run, pass, catch, kick, punt, jump, tackle, block and dive... Refs even call penalties. No matter what kind of fan you are, whether you know the rulebook inside-out or just watch an occasional game on TV... this is the one football game you've got to have!</resource>

In the QB Challenge, the player chooses from one of nineteen different NFL quarterbacks to compete in a series of challenges that will test their accuracy, speed, power and knowledge.  Players can also create their own custom quarterback and throw them into the competition.

Players can also customize their options including quarter lengths, weather conditions, rules, etc. The game also contains a battery backup to save games and created characters.</resource>

The control system makes it possible to execute one-touch passes, and several special trick moves to quickly advance the ball.

Graphics are improved from the previous version with the players being less angular, and thanks to 3Dfx support, with less pixels showing in the textures. The in-game presentation follows a TV-style script, zooming in players while displaying stats during clock stoppages.

As far as game modes go, in the year of the first Olympic Tournament with professional players, NHL 98 introduced the first real international competition, with 18 International teams to choose from. Other game modes include Season (option to pick between 25 or 82 games) and Playoff (best of 1, 3, 5 or 7 matches) and a Penalty Shootout mode.</resource>

Aside from the licenses, the gameplay for this edition sees for the first time the inclusion of the devastating one-timer shot, but to keep forwards (literally) in check, defenders also feature harder body checks, with new animations. For an additional challenge, players can also choose to control the goalkeeper manually. A popular feature in previous editions, fighting is completely removed from the game. Game modes include exhibition games (or &amp;quot;regular season&amp;quot; in-game), playoffs (best of one or best of seven) and an all new shoot-out mode. The main options remain basically the same couple since the establishment of the series - period length (5, 10 or 20 minutes), line changes (off, manual or the new automatic mode) and penalties. (off, on, on but no offsides). 

While there are some minor differences between platforms (Genesis  features record keeping for users and the MegaCD version has more stat screens, CD quality audio backdrops and the usual highlight clips here and there), only the PC version released at the same time features complete season action.</resource>

It features five heroines who compete with one another in highschool-related events to escape back to their homeworld.

These battles are represented on a grid-like battlefield, common to strategy games of the era, and when two units meet on the battlefield the game switches to its card-based combat system. The player randomly draws a hand of five cards when combat begins, spending one and then drawing a new card every round. The cards can involve attacking the opponent, defending from incoming damage, using magic to heal the player character's HP, a chance to escape combat as well as a number of other abilities that appear less frequently, like exchanging health with the opponent or switching costumes.

The game saw a 1997 Sony PlayStation sequel: Nage Libre: Rasen no Soukoku.</resource>

The player can select between various competitions, each increasing in difficulty and course number, and compete against CPU opponents in races across the world. The player can also choose to do practice runs or time trials on the various courses in the game. There are various customization options for the player's car, though if they so wish they can simply choose a pre-selected &amp;quot;Type&amp;quot; that automatically customizes a car to maximize handling or top speed, for example.

The game was endorsed by Japanese F1 driver Satoru Nakajima, who was active throughout 1987 to 1991. Super F-1 Hero was not released outside of Japan, neither was its direct sequel Nakajima Satoru F-1 Hero '94. However, the original Nakajima Satoru F-1 Hero is better known in the US as Michael Andretti's World GP.</resource>

His only wish is to surpass his father and to show him he has become a better fighter than him. Laila is a cheerful treasure hunter. She dreams only of valuable things, adventure, travels, and life in the capital city.  Gaou is experiencing a personal tragedy: he wants to discover the mystery of the disappearance of a woman he loved, Asuka, aided by his best friend Froz. Naaga is a girl who wears a heavy armor, which - as she thinks - will prevent her from losing any battle. At present, she has problems since she owes a million gold pieces to her guild. What do those heroes have in common? As their ways cross, they will find out they are in fact pursuing one and the same goal...

&amp;quot;Burning Heroes&amp;quot; lets you start as either one of the four characters. Each one starts in a different place and is seemingly absorbed in his/her personal quest, but as the game progresses, the four heroes meet each other. You should also find and &amp;quot;unlock&amp;quot;  four other playable characters as you advance in the game. The gameplay system of &amp;quot;Burning Heroes&amp;quot; is similar to other console-style RPGs: you fight random enemies and bosses in turn-based combat, viewed from third-person perspective, like in  Final Fantasy games. As you get hit in a battle, your &amp;quot;passion&amp;quot; (literally &amp;quot;hot blood&amp;quot;, nekketsu in Japanese) level rises, and the more damage you take, the quicker you reach 100%. Once the passion bar is full, you can summon a powerful monster and to unleash a devastating attack on the entire enemy party.</resource>

Long time ago, Duke was exiled from the country by his father. Traveling in faraway lands, Duke heard that his homeland was under attack. He decided to return to Neugier. On the way his ship was attacked by pirates, lead by a mysterious demon named Ord. After he barely escaped the ship, Duke found his way into his father's castle. He realized now that the pirates' attack and the monsters roaming the castle are connected. Although his father doesn't trust him, Duke is determined to save Neugier.

&amp;quot;Neugier&amp;quot; is an action adventure game in which you fight enemies in real-time, slashing them with your melee weapon. You have a &amp;quot;throw chain&amp;quot; ability, which allows you to press objects to the walls, destroying them. You can also push enemies to the walls this way. Duke can also jump and equip armor you find sometimes in dungeons.

Both it and True Golf Classics: Waialae Country Club were released in the same year of 1991, with the Japanese release of Waialae and True Golf Classics: Pebble Beach Golf Links the following year.



Harukanaru Augusta is an in-depth golf simulator, rather than an Arcade-style golf game. It has a lot of customization options for the player's stance and clubs, and the player can consider the wind direction and topography before every swing. The golfers are depicted as digitized sprites of actors, both in the portraits and whenever the player's character takes a swing.</resource>

Yatterman features a team of three heroes, all called Yatterman, who attempt to beat the supervillain team Doronbo (also a group of three) to a set of skull coins which will reveal the way to a giant treasure horde. The heroes often use toys and mechs to defeat their incompetent opponents, such as the male protagonist's kendamagic.

The game is similar to First Star's Spy vs. Spy series, in that both teams are attempting to reach the treasure first. They can trip up their opponents via a number of traps, some of which have conditional uses. By burying mines and setting off missiles, the player can whittle down the health of their opponents as well as keep them off their tracks. If the two teams meet, they fight each other in a three-on-three tag team battle with the losing side taking a large hit to their health. The game can be played single-player (as either the Yatterman team or the Doronbo team) or multiplayer.</resource>

The player has the option to drive a single race (where the option to practice is hidden) or go for the crown against 12 other drivers in 15 tracks (with some variety, not only ovals) across North America, with the season opener in Queensland, Australia. It is possible play solo, with a friend in split screen or with split screen against the computer, and if music or engine sounds are played in the race.
A key choice in the game is selecting between Arcade and Simulation mode - in the later, the car can take a lot less damage before giving up, fine-tuning must be done by the driver and rules are enforced, under the risk of a disqualification.

Graphically, the game is less sterile than most driving games of the platform (and in 16-bit consoles, generally), thanks to the inclusion of several polygonal buildings scattered around the circuits.

The game supports up to two players who compete on eighteen different courses. A single-player option, in which the player goes through each course sequentially, is also available. Each course takes place in a different part of the world, and tends to include unusual features like ice, stalagmites and other unlikely obstacles.

The game uses a rudimentary polygonal landscape to convey the lay of the land to the player, though this increases the loading time in many parts of the game as the topography has to be loaded in every time it shifts, either after a shot or while adjusting the camera to aim the ball a different direction.</resource>

Crazy Climber: An action game where the protagonist scales a building. Best known for its complex controls that independently control each hand.

Frisky Tom: An action game where the protagonist has to maintain a plumbing system and protect it from rogue rats.

Moon Cresta: A single-screen shoot 'em up similar to Galaxian in which the player's ship can dock with larger ships between stages to become more powerful.</resource>

It takes three steps to dig a pit big enough, and aliens will quickly fill holes that aren't large enough. If an alien catches the policeman, he will be eaten.

The enhanced version adds wooden blocks that can be chopped down, but this takes as long as digging pits and puts the player in peril during the time it takes to remove them. The game also includes a two player versus mode that gives each player half the screen. When an alien is removed from one player's side, it appears on the other player's side, so players must quickly remove aliens so they don't get overwhelmed by the sheer numbers.</resource>

The events in the game are based off of the actual game show events with the main goal being to score as many points as possible while trying to beat the clock.

In Elastic Sports, the player is strapped onto a long bungee cord and is bounced around.  There are three events: Slam Dunk is a basketball game, Attack is lacrosse and Spiral where the objective is to throw a football through a hanging tire.

Action Sports is an obstacle course which someone would find at a boot camp and is divided into two events:  Basic Training involves poles, swinging ropes and punching bags and Tornado Run which adds water jets and moving platforms.  Players can also pick up bonus items that will add time or replenish health and a chance at the bonus round.

The final event is the Aggro Crag which is a giant indoor mountain the player must climb while avoiding various obstacles such as confetti cannons, moving platforms and smoke vents.  The goal of this event is to navigate the mountain and activate five different sensors located on the mountain before being able to activate the last one at the very top of the mountain.

There is also an option for two friends to compete either head-to-head or alternating depending upon the event.  Elastic lets the players compete against each other on a split-screen while Action Sports and the Aggro Crag has to be played through alternating play.</resource>

The game was pitched somewhere in between a full-blown simulation like F1 GP and action games like Continental Circus. Only 12 cars were in each race, which could last from between 3 and 20 laps.

Before each race you can customize wing downforce, gear ratio, tyre selection and fuel load choices – pitstops are a standard feature of the longer races. The 16-bit versions include a unique 'Improve With Mansell' mode, in which a digitized version of Nigel's head appears in the top corner of the screen, offering instructions and praise.</resource>

Using this ability he has taken over the military forces and now appears unstoppable. However, resistance forces lead by Mulk have been developing a new weapon: Cybernetic Special Forces with the ability to think, dubbed the Ninja Warriors. Untested, these machines are given the orders to assassinate Benglar...

Ninja Warriors plays as a side scrolling beat 'em up, and is a single player adaptation of The Ninja Warriors arcade game. Players can choose from 3 different Ninja Warriors: Ninja, Kunoichi or Kamaitachi. The characters play differently, but share some common controls. Each can attack, jump, grab the enemy, block attacks or unleash a special attack on the entire screen. This special attack charges up gradually and can be reset by being knocked to the ground.

It is also the fourth Super Famicom game to be based on the Nintama Rantarou manga and anime license, and most closely resembles the first game.

The game's story mode has the player move from character to character while cutscenes play, with some gameplay sequences to break it up. Shinbei's first sequence starts as an adventure game, and segues to a runaway horse sequence, while Rantarou and Kirimaru progress through side-scrolling levels. Rantarou can use a grappling hook to cross large gaps, while Kirimaru can climb mossy walls.</resource>

The emphasis of Super Scope 6's gameplay is on first person shooting, using the required Super Scope accessory to aim. It features a total of six game modes, categorized as either Blastris or LaserBlazer.

Blastris Mode features a variety of unrelated games.

1. Blastris A is a falling block game based on Tetris and plays very similar. Blocks appear on the left side of the screen and move towards the right side of the screen, where they will fit into play. The goal is to have the blocks on any column line up and destroy themselves. Each level requires five of these to happen. Unlike Tetris, the player cannot move or even rotate blocks. Instead each section of the block can be destroyed by shooting it. Higher difficulty levels increase the speed of gameplay
2. Blastris B is a falling block game based on Columns and Puyo Puyo. On each screen are a number of &amp;quot;jelly blocks&amp;quot; which must be destroyed to complete the stage. New blocks appear at the top of the screen and move towards the bottom where they fit into play. Blocks can be destroyed by lining up a row of 4 blocks of the same colour. The player is unable to move the falling blocks but may cycle their colour by shooting at them.
3. Mole Patrol is combination of Whack-a-Mole and a shooting gallery. A number of moles appear on the screen with a flag indicating the amount that need to be destroyed that level, before jumping into a pipe. From there the moles will climb out of any one of 12 holes on the screen and the player must shoot them as fast as possible. Along with regular moles are pink moles that will temporarily speed up gameplay, making shots more difficult.

LazerBlazer Mode feature a group of games set in a military atmosphere.

1. Type A: Intercept is a first person shooting game where the player shoots down incoming missiles and airplanes. These missiles/planes appear on the right side of the screen and move towards the left side. A radar is also given to the player to keep track of overall positions of these objects on the screen. Ammunition is limited and the player must shoot down a certain amount each level.
4. Type B: Engage is a first person shooting game where the player shoots down incoming missiles and airplanes, which will cautiously open fire on the player. These missiles/planes appear in front of the player, in the distance and move towards the player. The player has limited energy which is decreased when hit by an enemy. A radar is also given to the player to keep track of overall positions of these objects on the screen. Ammunition is limited and the player must shoot down a certain amount each level. 
5. Type C: Confront is a first person shooting game where the player shoots down incoming spacecraft, which will actively open fire on the player. These UFOs can appear anywhere on the screen and the player must shoot them down before they open fire on the player. Each hit by an enemy decreases the player's shield energy. A radar is also given to the player to keep track of overall positions of these objects on the screen. Ammunition is limited and the player must shoot down a certain amount each level.</resource>

After this game, the Nishijin Pachinko series would move to the Sony PlayStation with the new subtitle Tengoku (or &amp;quot;paradise&amp;quot;).

Unlike the first two games, which used a life sim framing device and had Monogatari (&amp;quot;story&amp;quot;) in the title, the game simply presents two machines that the player can practice on. Since these are virtual approximations of real-like pachinko machines, the player can glean a strategy for winning big in the pachinko parlors with enough training.</resource>

The game is named for and features virtual versions of machines produced by the Nishijin company: a real-like pachinko machine manufacturer. It follows the likes of Heiwa Pachinko World and Kyouraku - Sanyo - Toyomaru Parlor! Parlor! in creating a game based around the actual pachinko machines of specific manufacturers with the intent being to prepare players for the real thing.

Nishijin Pachinko Monogatari was followed by two more sequels for the Super Famicom: Nishijin Pachinko Monogatari 2 and Nishijin Pachinko 3, both released in 1996. After that, the series would move onto the Sony PlayStation as Nishijin Pachinko Tengoku.</resource>

A secondary goal of the game is to teach players how to master the real-life versions of these machines, a common trait for pachinko games developed at the time. Other Super Famicom series, like Heiwa Pachinko World or Parlor! Parlor!, also features machines from other manufacturers.</resource>

J.T. Robbins, whose only objective of the game is to escape an island. After shooting his commanding officer, Robbins is imprisoned and eventually sent to the island Absolom as a war criminal, from where there is no escape possible. To do this still, the player must explore the island with side-scrolling platform gameplay for clues, finding items and combining them to make weapons and traps.  

Robbins can talk to some prisoners to help him in his quest, but he must also avoid violent prisoners, either by attacking them with punches or kicks or using traps and stealth to bypass them. The graphics are based off of rotoscopes of the actual actors from the movie.</resource>

Many dreamt of conquering the land, becoming the Shogun and ruling the entire country. One of those daimyos was the ambitious Nobunaga Oda, a merciless ruler and a renowned strategist. Players take on the role of Nobunaga Oda or one of many other daimyos to try to conquer Japan.

Nobunaga's Ambition is a turn-based strategy game which can be played in different modes.  Players begin by selecting either a 17 regions scenario or a larger 50 scenario. Then, the player must select a daimyo, each of which is rated attributes in several categories; Age, Health, Ambition, Luck, Charm and IQ. As the game progresses, these values change depending on events in the game. The age value represents a time limit of sorts, as an elderly daimyo becomes increasingly likely to die of old age or sickness.</resource>

It was released exclusively in Japan and is based on the Nontan books for younger children that follows the eponymous mischievous kitten and his animal friends on their adventures. The game is a twist on the standard block-stacking puzzle game.

Nontan to Isshi: KuruKuru Puzzle is one of the few games that Game Freak worked on before they created their breakout hit Pokémon.

The goal of Nontan to Isshi: KuruKuru Puzzle is to stack blocks so that two matching icons are connected to one another adjacently and vanish. The player cannot rotate the two-piece blocks that fall from the top: instead, they flip the blocks around to reveal two different blocks on the opposite side. Most of the flipped blocks are linked to their originals: a fish becomes a fish skeleton, an apple becomes an apple half, etc. Sometimes they're rare bee or character face blocks instead: both are rare and are therefore difficult to clear once one appears, but two face blocks will eliminate an entire row when connected and are thus worth the hassle.

The game has an endless single-player mode that only ends once the blocks reach the top of the screen. There is also a two-player mode.</resource>

The gameplay consists of a combination of arcade elements and first person view much like Eye of the Beholder and Dungeon Master.  One of the more remarkable features is in the first person mode, rather than having just 4 directs to face and flicking between them there are 8 directions and the view scrolls smoothly as you turn. This smooth scrolling continues when you move forward, giving the game more of a 3D feel.

The arcade elements consist of horizontal scrolling areas where you fight enemies with your bow while avoiding their attacks.  Later you encounter a similar type of gameplay that involves exploring castles and adds 4 directional movement.</resource>

The game uses the real-life golf course of Ko Olina Golf Club in Hawaii. Ko Olina hosted the LPGA Hawaiian Open between 1990-95, when this game was developed.

Okamoto Ayako to Match Play Golf is a much more serious simulation-style golf game. The player has to select their direction and golf club (though the game will automatically select suitable defaults) and accurately hit the power meter to get the most out of each shot.</resource>

The game's puzzles resemble normal jigsaw puzzles: the player has to take several pieces, often flipping them vertically or horizontally, and place them in their correct locations on a grid. The complication is that the image is animating in a constant loop. Often, this provides a hint as to the correct orientation of the piece (if a figure is climbing a wall, for instance, all the wall pieces should be scrolling downwards), but is often used by the game to be disorienting.</resource>

A typical button masher, includes 10 events (100m sprint, 110m hurdles, pole vault, long jump, triple jump, javelin, high jump, discus, skeet and archery) and 32 countries around the world compete in custom or full Olympics, or just practice. Two players can compete head to head in the sprinting events, and a total of eight can play in the same game. Three difficulty levels allow competitive events for both rookies to veterans in the genre.

Sprinting events are a short and straight button mashing frenzy. 4 athletes compete simultaneously, the first winner advancing to the next round (two qualifiers and then the medal run). Only fast fingers and quick shotgun reaction can earn world record times. 

Jumping events are a mix of shorter button mashing bursts combined with timely pressed jumps. From the straight forward high and long jump events (run and then set the jump angle) to the more elaborate triple jump (as the name suggests, three jumps must be carefully measured for world class results) and the complex pole vault, where a strong run must be followed by a sharp pole fixation and good a release upwards. Both long jump and triple jump have a first round composed by three jumps, the better eight progress into the second round, where they are given three more jumps. In the high jump and pole vault the competition continues until all athletes miss three consecutive jumps.

The throwing events (discus and javelin) work in the same fashion as the jumping events, although trickier to pull, as the setting of the angle must be followed by a timely release. Each player is entitled to three throws, the top eight allowed three more attempts.

Finally, the shooting events. Archery is a three-round competition where the goal is to amass as many points as possible by shooting at the inner rings of the target. With six arrows per round, each shot must be calculated according to the wind, choosing between steady aim and lower tension (must be aimed upwards and compensating the wind) or higher tension but a jumpy aim (can be aimed directly at the &amp;quot;gold&amp;quot; points). Skeet is a five round competition where the goal is to hit five clay pigeons before they disappear off-screen with two slugs for each.</resource>

    <resource id="ff28be76dfa4f522822f38142c86128a76a6efde" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">There's a kind of knick-knack you may find in dusty games rooms, a maze through which you navigate a marble by subtly tilting the board, dancing with gravity and momentum, deftly rolling your sphere out of dead ends and around the obstacles posed by holes in the board. Marble Madness explores this theme in a fudged 3-D perspective, Cloud Kingdoms in a flat 2-D one -- both by directly influencing the actions of the ball.  The game takes a different approach toward a similar end; instead of moving the ball around the board, you move the board around the ball.

That's right; from the get-go, gravity pulls ever down, down, down on your ball toward the bottom of your screen regardless of board orientation; the task of the player is to rotate the board now clockwise, now counter-clockwise, to further a timely and unobstructed path beneath the ball in its progress toward each level's goal before the timer ticks down to zero.  The game might as well have been named &amp;quot;inertia.&amp;quot;  Many obstacles can be avoided, but some must be engaged head-on: a certain momentum, if not terminal velocity, must be achieved to break through crumbling brick barriers; other obstacles toggle on and off like traffic lights, demanding not only speed but timing.  Some influence the ball's direction, and in addition to merely delaying the ball's progress, touching some impediments incurs an additional time penalty -- conversely, some blocks bestow time bonuses, if you can afford the ever-diminishing time needed to take the scenic detour and collect them.

It may seem like a transparent attempt to cobble together a game around a technical demo of the SNES' Mode 7 on-the-fly graphics-rotation capabilities, but Taito actually cooked up this kooky game interface two years earlier for an arcade release of this game.

(Now if only someone could explain the &amp;quot;Camel&amp;quot; part - referencing the Japanese title.)</resource>

Playing as the bionic soldier, this game is a top-down shooter. The player must blast their way through enemy forces and the activate various switches to progress. Accessing computer memory banks throughout the facility will reveal footage of the accident and give some idea of all it happened. Additionally, dimensional holes have opened up all around the levels allowing monsters to appear and making certain paths, walls and technologies inaccessible until the area has been stabilized.

The soldier uses a main weapon and a secondary weapon to progress, both of which can be cycled at any time and upgraded to new weapons found in the area.</resource>

An airliner is hijacked by terrorists en-route from Paris to Boston, who threaten to kill all hostages on board if their mates aren't released from jail. Instead of reaching its destination, the airliner makes a landing in Kalubya, Africa, and all the hostages are hidden in various locations. The authorities have asked the hero from Operation Wolf to rescue the hostages, but only this time, the hero brings his friend along for the ride.

There are eight missions to complete in Operation Thunderbolt, and each one has you shooting down soldiers, choppers, and tanks. The gameplay varies every one or two missions. In some missions, you are driving a jeep or controlling a boat, while in others, you are walking while you're shooting. You have a limited supply of ammo, and a limited supply of rocket bombs, but you can always stock up by shooting down crates falling from the sky, or by killing a cat or dog that get in the line of fire. Also from crates, you can get special items like bulletproof vests, rocket bombs, and different weapons.

You also have a life bar to worry about. If you're shot at by soldiers, or if rocket bombs or grenades are thrown at you, you 'll lose energy, and once you're energy is depleted,  you lose one of your three lives. You can lose a lot of energy by killing hostages on purpose,  and you can't easily avoid killing them if you decide to use rocket bombs to wipe out enemies. The eighth mission, the mission that involves you fighting terrorists on a plane,  proves to be difficult because a woman in a blue dress stands up and gets in the line of fire, and you have to very careful when you're going to use rocket bombs.

There are two endings to this game, and which ending you can watch will depend on the number of hostages you've saved, and whether or not you shot the pilot instead of the mission eight boss.</resource>

The player has a four-by-four grid with which to plant crops, each of which will grow at a specific rate. They must also fight off various creatures which show up to eat or damage the crops. Once each crop has fully grown, the player can run down to collect them and use the empty land left behind to plant something else.</resource>

The single-player has a fairytale literature theme to it as characters as diverse as Lewis Carroll's Cheshire Cat and The White Rabbit, as well as traditional characters like Little Red Riding Hood and the seven Dwarves, challenge the player to Othello duels before they are allowed to proceed onwards.

Othello World was eventually followed by a PS1 sequel: Othello World II: Yume to Michi e no Chousen.

As is traditional in Othello, the goal is to sandwich the opponent's pieces between two pieces of the player's own color. Doing so flips all of the opponent's tiles between the two, awarding them to the player. It's generally imperative to reach the boundary of the board, and especially the corners, as pieces placed there are in more defensible positions.</resource>

A nonogram is a puzzle on a square or rectangular grid the object of which is to reveal a hidden picture. Along each row and column there is a number or series of numbers which indicate how many squares will be colored in that row or grid. Example; &amp;quot;5 9 4&amp;quot; would mean there would be sets of five, nine, and four colored squares in the grid, in that order, with at least one blank in between. 

Ou-chan no Oekaki Logic adds a story mode where Ou-Chan, representing the player, competes with other blobby anime characters in finding hidden images in the nonogram grids.</resource>

Anyway, the game closely resembles &amp;quot;The Road Warrior&amp;quot; (Mad Max 2). Your objective is to drive your car through the wasteland, trying to survive motorcycle gang members' attacks and to avoid running out of gas.

The gameplay is a split of two genres: racing and side-scrolling. In the racing parts you have to destroy enemies like motorcycle gang members, gyro-copter captains, red trucks, etc. Your car has a machine-gun installed in its front, and if some guy drives along side of you, a little window pops up, allowing you to shoot them with your shotgun.

Along the road there are several towns, and every time you pass through one of them, an alarm will warn you. As your gas run low, you have to stop on these towns and refuel your reserves of gas and ammo. When doing so, the game turns to a side-scrolling perspective, as you get out of your car, dealing with your enemies in hand-to-hand combats. In the cities you'll also find new equipment to your car, such as missile launchers, nitro, etc.</resource>

It features 5 courses from across Europe, and 60 top European pros, rather than the US-leaned lineup of the original. The graphics are much more detailed and colorful, as you'd expect considering the intervening years of advances in programming skill.

The control system is the standard three-click method used in most golf games, but you can now define intended draw/fade levels in advance of playing the shot, so that a perfect aim leads to a measured effect, and an imperfect one exaggerating the effect.

As well as the Stroke Play games of the original (where you count the total score across the whole round of 18 holes, and compare this to your opponent), there are also Match Play (where the aim is to win as many individual holes as possible) and Skins (the same, but with money) modes as well.</resource>

    <resource id="e660815d713af385243483e1c4e8dfe0e59d8a13" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">PGA Tour 96 was the last of the series released for Sega's 16-bit console, and technologically the most advanced one. Instead of offering  several generic courses, the three available (Spyglass Hill, Sawgrass and River Highlands) are in 3D, with height differences visible (as well as the limited 3D abilities of the console allow).

The player can either chose to play as one of the 10 PGA Pros (whose swings were digitized), or go Pro - the game keeps track of statistics (longest drive, driving accuracy, best round, etc), a game (Tournament, Strokeplay, Skins, Match and Shootout), as well as a replay.

Gameplaywise, PGA 96 uses the tried-and-proved triple click system - one to start the swing, other to set strength and a final one for accuracy. It's possible to fade or draw the ball (to bend the trajectory), add backspin and pitch or chip the ball (for some medium range attempts at the hole or go above a bush).The difficulty level affects mostly the leniency of the triple click hit areas - while at novice it is possible to let the accuracy a bit off-center, in pro levels the ball goes where your swing took it - no excuses taken. However, only in Pro it is possible to make the longest drives, as the amateur and novice levels take a few yards from the total capacity of the club.</resource>

The three-click control method (the first to start the swing, the second setting power and over-swing, the third setting draw or fade) allowed for a multitude of different shots, and required a sense of timing. 

Four courses are included, one of them a fantasy 'links' course designed by the programmers. Some of the holes are fiendish, with bunkers, water hazards and trees, and the need to plan strategies to get the best approach to the green.

When playing a tournament there are 60 opponents, each representing top US golfers - ten of these appear with tactical advice for each hole.</resource>

    <resource id="e8aba579b5428fd6f91d1f27ca8a42a69cc9aa43" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Based on Namco's Japanese-only arcade puzzler Cosmo Gang the Puzzle, Pac-Attack is similar to many block-dropping puzzle games from the time, such as Puyo Puyo.

The objective of the game is to place ghosts and then, after three pieces (which can include one or two blocks as well), make Pac-Man eat as many ghosts as possible to try and clear up the game area. Pac-Man's directions are chosen at random between left or right, but as he goes moving on the game area (after you place him, of course), if he bumps against a block or a &amp;quot;wall&amp;quot; on the game area, he will change his direction. As with many block-dropping puzzlers, if a line of blocks and/or ghosts reaches the top, the game ends. However, by filling up a meter on the left of the game area, a fairy may appear that can clear approximately 6 or 7 lines with ghosts, but it only clears the ghosts, although the blocks that were on top of them will drop.

Also, like many puzzlers, it contains a versus mode against another human player. It's similar to the many versus modes of puzzle games: eat plenty of ghosts and your opponent will recieve many ghosts on his area.

The game also includes a Puzzle mode. It features 100 levels, in which you have to eat all ghosts with no more than 4 Pac-Men at least (the number reduces in certain levels), and, unlike the other modes, you can change Pac-Man's direction with the press of a button.

All of the handheld versions (including the one on Pac-Man Collection) lack the versus mode.</resource>

The &amp;quot;Special&amp;quot; in the title was added for Super Famicom entries. It would also be the last Pachiokun game for the system.

Unlike its predecessors, each of which presented a new setting, Pachiokun Special 3 instead revisits the first four Pachiokun games for NES: Pachiokun, Pachiokun 2, Pachiokun 3 and Pachiokun 4. All four games have been recreated with 16-bit graphics, and each begins with a video message to Pachiokun that fills him on the plot for that particular entry. The gameplay remains identical: play various pachinko machines to reach a target amount of winnings to progress the plot.</resource>

Thirteen years ago a strange disaster befell this world and killed many people. Upon the ruins of a great city and sealing back a great evil, a school of magic was built. Young Chezni is a student of that school of magic, striving to become a great spiritualist and control the elements. Meanwhile, a dictator to the south, Zaygos has conquered the entire continent and seeks to conquer the other half of the world. One day, after class Chezni is dared by a fellow classmate to enter and explore the forbidden tower that sits outside the school of magic. Entering the tower, Chezni will soon learn of the machine, Dal Gren that has been sleeping there for 10,000 years. What consequences will his actions have?

Paladin's Quest is a 1-player RPG where the player moves around the world and in locations using an overhead view with up to four members in the party. Randomly encountered monsters engage in a first-person view battle mode that is played using turn-based commands to each player. Along with weapons, magic is available and uses the character's own hitpoints to command. There is no healing magic and no healing items, rather some characters have &amp;quot;bottles&amp;quot;, one type of which can restore HP and these can be filled (nine uses per bottle) at most towns. Each character has a different profieciency in one of eight different elements, which may be combined to produce additional spells. New element usage can sometimes be learned by main characters in temples.</resource>

Mini: Pachinko Jikki Simulation Game (&amp;quot;Jikki&amp;quot; means &amp;quot;machine&amp;quot;) is a pachinko game for the Super Famicom and the first in an off-shoot series based on Telenet Japan's Parlor! Parlor! series which intends to teach Super Famicom owners how to win big on real-life versions of the machines they feature. The Parlor! Mini series focuses on a smaller number of machines - typically two per game - and were sold for a budget price. Parlor! Mini was followed by seven sequels released throughout 1996, 1997 and 1998.

The first Parlor! Mini features a machine with an aquatic theme and another with an Asian dragon theme. Both have a pachi-slot component, where aiming pachinko balls for the device in the middle of the table would cause slots to spin. The player is free to practice on the machines with an infinite supply of pachinko balls, scrutinize the peg configurations for both and get tips and advice from the game to learn how to master their real-life equivalents.</resource>

The Peace Keepers is a side-scrolling fighting game similar to games in the Final Fight series. The player can choose from four characters (plus two that become available later in the game) with different strengths and weaknesses. In addition to combinations of standard attacks, jump-, run-  and throwing attacks, all characters can also block attacks, perform single heavy attacks, special attacks that consume a certain amount of energy and super attacks. Super attacks damage all enemies on-screen, but can only be used twice per continue. If a character is hit repeatedly, there is a chance that they temporarily switch into &amp;quot;angry-mode&amp;quot; during which they are invincible and more powerful. 

Most levels offer different paths and exits, and after every level, a different character may be selected. This means that levels may be played through in different orders and that it is not at all necessary to play through all the levels to reach one of several endings.</resource>

There were a total of eight volumes in the series released on a bi-monthly basis from April 1999 to June 2000. Each volume includes a substantial number of puzzles of varying sizes and difficulty. A large number of these puzzles would later be rereleased as downloadable content for Picross DS. The puzzle solving gameplay of the titles is nearly identical to that of their direct predecessor Mario no Super Picross just with minor changes in the presentation. Notably, Mario and Wario are no longer featured as guides through the game modes. Also, the stone chiseling archeologist motif that was present in the previous titles has been dropped in favor of a simple pen-on-paper style.</resource>

So, when the vegetables start attempting to run away from him, he has no choice but to chase after them.

Out To Lunch is a platform game set across 6 countries, starting off in Switzerland and finishing in Paris. To recollect the vegetables he must first stun them, either by firing at them or jumping on them, then walk over them, in a manner similar to Fire &amp; Ice. Unusually, the game was converted from the SNES to the Amiga, not the other way around.

Each one has a range of ramps, combos, light sequences and targets to shoot, as well as general themes which are less influenced by real tables than those in Pinball Dreams.</resource>

It seems that a port of this game was in development for the Super Nintendo but never completed for various reasons. Thanks to an anonymous contributor a playable version of Pinkie SNES was leaked and can now be preserved.

This is a developer build and has various debugging features turned on, such as the controller Select button will allow you teleport the character anywhere in a level and the map screen automatically unlocks the next level without you needing to complete the previous level. There's lots of other bits in there as well ? along with various parts that are completely broken such as the level exit effect which will cause the game to lose frames and never properly recover.</resource>

The pieces are offered in random order, and there are seven different types - straight lines going horizontally or vertically, corners rotating in each of the four directions, and cross-over pieces which carry the flooz straight across horizontally and vertically. Each of these can be entered from either side. When the flooz hits a gap, or a piece which the previous piece can't flow into, the pipe is finished.

Before the flooz starts flowing from its randomly-selected starting position, the player has several seconds to start placing pieces. They can be put down anywhere. However a situation that can often occur is there will be a long and complex piping arrangement set up, yet a gap somewhere remains to be filled. Players are able to  replace a piece with another in the same square (to make it easier to flow the flooz that way), but for a slight scoring penalty.

Bonuses are awarded for looping the flooz through both sides of at least 5 cross-over pieces, or passing the flooz through every square on the screen. Later levels have some squares on the grid blocked off, a few gaps in the side-wall (allowing flooz to thread to the other side of the screen). After every four levels there is a bonus game for points, in which the player can only place the pieces in the lowest open space in each column, similarly to the board game of &amp;quot;Connect 4&amp;quot;.</resource>

Prince Ren and his companions must find the Treasures of Rule to control the Dark Water and return Mer to its former glory. Always hot on their heels is the evil pirate-lord Bloth who wants to find the treasures to rule over Mer.

Based on a cartoon series by the same name, The Pirates of Dark Water is a side scrolling fighting game similar to Final Fight or Streets of Rage.

The player chooses a character, from among Prince Ren and his two companions Tula and Ioz, who differ in strength and agility, but who use the same basic attacks. There are two attack buttons, one for fast attacks and combinations and one for a single heavy attack. Other controls include: blocking attacks, grabbing and throwing opponents, dash attacks while running, and a special attack that hits multiple enemies consuming life energy at the same time. Most levels also require you to avoid obstacles like chasms, falling rocks or spikes that shoot out of the ground.</resource>

Princess Luna has been kidnapped by a gang of evil demons and its up to Shinto priestess Pocky and her raccoon buddy Rocky to rescue her.

As in the previous game, the gameplay involves taking control of either character to clear stage after stage of enemies in classic top-down shooter manner by blasting them with your magic cards or other collectable unique powers. New for the sequel is the ability to play with optional AI-controlled partners that add team-up special moves required to beat certain bosses as well as unique abilities that take the game in different directions (opening locks, or digging to get to the underworld sections of each stage for instance).</resource>

It was licensed outside of Japan as Rocky Raccat!.
In-game, animals have stolen the sweet treats of Pokonyan's human friend Miki Konoha (known as Amy in the Rocky Raccat version) and Pokonyan quickly pursues them. Pokonyan collects food items along the way - each of which adds to a bonus after the stage is complete - and Pokonyan can jump, sprint and change shape with his powers. His other forms give him stronger jumping and attacking capabiltiies, depending on the shape.</resource>

Heroes Light and Pastel decide to go out and help a young maiden bring sense back to her scientist father, who apparently has bumped his head and transformed into a evil mastermind that seeks world domination.

As the other games in the series Pop'n Twinbee is a vertically-scrolling arcade shooter in which you and a friend get behind the controls of Twinbee and Winbee, the cutest starfighters ever created, and try to clear stage after stage of enemies with your  weapons. Being a console original instead of a port, Pop'n features a number of additions to the gameplay mechanics, including an energy bar, eight difficulty levels and a handicap feature when playing with a friend (which makes most enemies target one fighter instead of the other).

The upgrade system remains consistent with the series's: you shoot colored bells which give different power-ups when collected, including multiple shots, &amp;quot;options&amp;quot; and shield energy. Also when correctly powered-up both fighters can join and perform powerful team-up moves.</resource>

In this mode the second player takes control over one of the two characters left. Either way your task is to find and defeat the evil Dr. Warmon who tries to enslave the islands of Dunburi.

To deal with the many villains Dr. Warmon throws at you, you need to collect colored bells. Depending on the color of the bell you can use different attacks like a laser (blue bells) or a lash (orange bells). But even without the bells you're not defenseless. Your standard-attacks include a shock wave and the ability to fly.

After Popeye trounces his nemesis the Sea Hag, she gets her revenge by separating all of Popeye's friends from their lifeforce, causing them to turn to stone. Popeye has to recover all their life energy (in the form of hearts) from a board game-like grid while avoiding the various heavies that have been sent to deter him, including his rival Bluto who is hoping to win Olive Oyl's heart by rescuing her first.

Each stage takes place in a grid, and Popeye moves around by rolling a die and moving one to six spaces around the board. Some tiles allow him to purchase upgrades, recover health, move to other map squares and play through small platforming sequences. Occasionally, Popeye can bump into moving enemies on the map (similar to the overworld enemies in Super Mario Bros. 3) and fight a quick one-on-one battle with them for bonuses. His goal is to land on every square with a heart on it and find the heart in the stage somewhere. By collecting them all, Popeye saves a friend and moves onto the next board.

The game was released only in Japan for the Super Famicom.</resource>

While you might think that a cute Anime chick would have no trouble making a living slashing bad guys with her sword, Popful is having a hard time making ends meet.  One day, however, Popful learns about a magician who has gone rogue and has a hefty bounty on his head. So, her adventure begins as Popful fights her way through a new adventure, and makes new friends along the way.

Primarily this is an action game with very slight RPG elements. As you make your way through the plethora of levels, you will have to collect money from slain foes. You use this money in the shops to buy weapons, armor, health, and so on. Also, this game features interaction with many, many characters through both on-screen dialog and fully animated sequences. Some of these characters become playable as you progress through the game.

This release has the same story and general gameplay style as the  earlier version, but otherwise was made from scratch, having entirely different graphics, locations, enemies, challenges, etc.</resource>

To win, you must help your chosen people take over the world and wipe out the vermin who worship that other god.

Each god starts out with a single human, dumped into the middle of the wilderness.  Sometimes there is inhabitable land in sight, sometimes not.  To get win, you must change the landscape, creating flat land for your followers to build on.  The more followers you have you have, the more powerful you will be, so take care of them. Build as fast as you can, because the other god is doing the same.

When you have enough followers, you can make the leader of your people into a hero.  He will then go around the land you have built, literally taking strength from the people into himself, and working his way toward the enemy.  When he gets there, he will engage in holy warfare upon your enemy's people.  He will burn; he will kill.  And he won't stop until they're all dead... or he is.

But you don't have to let your people have all the fun; the god's have other tools as well.  You can drown your enemies one at a time with your land lowering powers.  Submerge their towns in swamps. Raise a volcano in the middle of their best farmland.  Even better, you can flood the land and drain all the people who didn't build on high-ground. 

And when you win, you'll have 500 more worlds to conquer.  A god's play is just never done.</resource>

The gameplay mechanics are similar to Populous, but PII features a wider array of spells, digitized sound, and high-resolution graphics to give the spell effects extra punch.  Multiplayer is supported via serial link and dial-up.

One day, he meets an old martial artist who tells him he should travel all over the world to meet other teachers and to learn from them. During his travels, Joe encounters many other fighters, and has to become more and more skillful in order to prove that he is the greatest fighter in the world.

Unlike most other fighting games, you can control only one character (Joe) in single-player mode. In two-player mode, you can choose to fight as any of the seven available fighters, and also choose a scenery. The game plays like a standard 2D fighter: you can punch, kick, and jump on you opponents, but the fights are not entirely 2D, since you can also take a few steps vertically.

Each pilot has different attribute levels for Acceleration, Speed and Grip, providing a more balanced competition. Besides several obstacles and speed energizers scattered by the courses, players can attack opponents by firing Blasters (a la Super Mario Kart special items) at your adversaries; the limit is 5 Blasters per race except by Cog Soldier's infinite Blaster amount.

Along with 1-Player game modes (Race, Time Trial and VS CPU), the game also offers 2-Player split-screen gameplay through Race and 2P VS plus 3 alternative modalities: Point Race, where players must to race over objects to earn points; Bumper Chase, with the main objective to ram the opponent off the course; and Blaster Master, a Life Energy-based deathmatch.

The Super Nintendo version was going to be one of the few games to make use of the FX chip. It was being developed by Elite. Another racing game by the name Power Slide was eventually released for PC but it doesnt seem to be connected to this game in any way. The car handling physics in Power Slide were very advanced for the time, as were the visuals. Frame rate was less impressive unfortunately. A playable demo of Power Slide SNES does exist and it was leaked thanks to Eludevisibility! The in-game screens dont look anywhere as nice as the original tech demo tough. The game would have probably been like Dirt Racer, the other SNES racing game by Elite, released in 1994. Power Slide was basically a rally game, with real rally cars, Dirt Racer was a more arcade style game. The 3DO and PC versions of Power Slide were being developed by Maelstrom Games for Elite.</resource>

Nintendo PowerFest '94 was a 1994 Nintendo-promoted video game competition. Most of the town competitions were held in customized trailers outside of department stores. It was based on scoring points in a special Game Pak. The three Super Nintendo Entertainment System games (Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels, Super Mario Kart, and Ken Griffey, Jr. Presents Major League Baseball) were played within a time limit of six minutes.

The tasks on the games are as follows:

Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels: Players must complete the first level as quickly as possible.
Super Mario Kart: Players must finish the first track of five laps.
Ken Griffey, Jr. Presents Major League Baseball: Players must play a home run derby and hit as many home runs as possible.

After the time expires, the final score is calculated like this:

Score from Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels+ ((Coins collected in Super Mario Kart x 1,000) + Finishing position score)+ ((Total distance in Major League Baseball x 100) + (Number of home runs x 10,000 in the regional events or 1,000,000 in the Finals)) = Grand Total</resource>

The game cast the player as a dispossessed warlord plundering his way through 195 territories on the way to world conquest. Several other leaders have the same goal.

The gameworld is now made up of polygons, so the view can be rotated and moved with greater freedom than Populous. Trade, diplomacy, inventions, and scorched earth invasions all play a key role in how the player progressed through the game.  Two-player games via modem links are available on computer versions.

You're not going to let that happen are you? Try to escape from the dungeon, take out Jaffar's guards, find your way through the Sultan's palace and defeat Jaffar himself. Now go, you've got 60 minutes!

Prince of Persia is a 2D platformer with run and jump gameplay. Your hero must avoid deadly traps, solve some simple puzzles and engage in sword fights with the guards. The player has an infinite amount of lives, but has to restart at the beginning of a level each time he dies, and must complete the game within an hour. An especially noteworthy aspect of the game is the very fluent animation of your character.

The Game Boy Color and SNES versions of the game feature additional levels and new enemies. The Genesis version has a new intro and an altered set of graphics but the level layout remains almost identical to that of the original.</resource>

In the kingdom of Whistler, the best fighters are young, beautiful women, proficient in many styles of combat. Princess Minerva is one of them. She participates in a tournament, battles against the best female fighters of the country, and ultimately joins forces with them, building a super-powerful party that is bound to defeat the archenemy of the Queen of Whistler, the evil sorceress Dynastar.

The game begins where the girls are already united and are getting ready for the grand quest. Your party contains nine girls, each one with various statistics and magic spells. The large party is divided into three smaller ones, and you switch between them while participating in random battles and fighting bosses. The combat is turn-based, and is viewed from a top-down perspective, like the locations you visit. You travel on the overworld map, visit towns, and descend into dungeons. The three active girls in your party can also unite to perform combo attacks.</resource>

Since this game doesn't have an NFL or NFLPA license, there aren't any real NFL teams or players here, although the teams included in the game represent the cities of their real life NFL counterparts and also mimic the colors of their team's uniforms.

The games options allow the player to choose to play on 6 different field surfaces (grass, mud, dirt, snow, rain and artificial turf) and to choose how long the game will last (2, 5, 10 or 15 minute quarters). There are also no penalties in this game whatsoever. 

Gameplay consists of playing on both offense and defense. There are 26 different offensive plays and 18 different defensive plays to choose from. The game has a down the field view when on offense, so the game doesn't have receivers in windows.</resource>

The game uses the mascots of the Nippon Professional Baseball league as its playable characters, and is licensed to use the team names and mascot characters.

The game features standard versus modes and a puzzle mode where the player has to remove all the blocks in a limited number of moves.

The goal of the game is identical to that of Puyo Puyo: players remove blocks on their screen by stacking four or more icons of the same color in any arrangement, as long as it forms a contiguous unbroken line. By setting up chain reactions of eliminations, the player can create trash that gets dropped on their opponent, making their game harder.

Pro Yakyuu Nettou Puzzle Stadium adds extra features to coincide with the baseball theme: one player is &amp;quot;batting&amp;quot; while the other is &amp;quot;pitching&amp;quot;, and the game alternates which player is which. The goal of the former is to create combos and quickly eliminate sets to fill bases, which eventually leads to points on the table. The goal of the latter is to quickly eliminate sets so they can be the batting player again. The pitching player has the advantage, as trash vanishes quicker for them, which means the batting player has to move fast to score any points before they change back over.</resource>

Pro Yakyuu Star would become the last game in the series.

Because Pro Yakyuu Star does not feature the franchise's traditional &amp;quot;superhuman league&amp;quot; mode, the name was changed. It is functionally identical to the previous games in the series beyond that exception, however. The player can take part in exhibition matches and pennant races with a second human player or the CPU, as well as a single-player training mode.</resource>

    <resource id="2706cc3967da57ea567b0e51b508f18056c689ac" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Psycho Dream is a side-scrolling action game with light platforming elements, similar in style to Valis games, though less story-driven. The game is set in predominantly modern-day environments. The player can choose to control either Ryo Shizima or Maria Tobari, two demon hunters who must save an innocent girl named Sayaka and rid the world of rampaging monsters. The two protagonists share the same stages; only single-player mode is available.

Both demon hunters rely mostly on close-range attacks - Ryo with a sword, Maria with a whip, though they can also use guns. Most of the gameplay consists of slowly walking through monster-infested areas, eliminating enemies and avoiding obstacles, which often requires jumping and ducking. Power-ups are obtained from fallen foes. Depending on their color, these power-ups can increase the attack level of a weapon, envelop the character in a protective force field, or restore his/her health. Rare red power-ups are unique to each character: Ryo dons a special armor that hits enemies with bouncing lasers, while Maria gets in touch with her angelic nature, growing wings and firing homing energy balls.</resource>

    <resource id="6bb91a0f93a0881cc8e8d2616258246eb438a1c4" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">You're playing a small ant that is willing to help a friend in rather inconvenient situation. Apparently, your friend, doggie, likes to eat cookies that has his picture on their box, and he got himself so carried away that he lost the balance, and a bag of cookies fell deep down into an ant-hill. Now, you're goin' in, in a mission of solving puzzles, and retrieving the cookies for your friend.

Now, this ant-hill is a bit different from the ones you saw, and especially from the one you live in. It's path is filled up with boulders, and all the gates, and you must travel the quest to find the cookies. After each different place inside, you'll fins a small bag of cookie, and bring it back to your friend doggie.

The main quest consists of you carrying your-size boulders, and placing them in a well imagined line, so when you push the exact one, all must fall, and the one that marks the end must fall the last, or the door will stay shut permanently. Beside we know that ants are very easy, and can live almost every fall, you cannot practice that, so if you jusp from a little bit too high position, don't expect much, but to retry the level.

Every block, or boulder in a game has a different markings. Like for example, the yellow ones are bricks you can push, and they will just as easily fall, and push, or not, the brick in front of it. The red ones will do the opposite, you cannot push them, and if the yellow, or any other brick hits it, it'll continue falling back to the other side. Some bricks explode when you push them, or other brick hits them, and that way they leave the hole, so your brick can continue spining, or yet again, not. Some spin without stop, 'til they hit some other brick that can fall, some replaces the spaces, like building a bridge on that place, some go high and when hit the top, they stick to it, and push, or not, the brick in front of them. Anyway, that's the game basics.

Each level gives you the new code/password, so you can continue from the position where you ended each time you type that code. Perspective of your ant is like in any other platform game, and you control it with arrow keys, or joystick. But beware, the time is clicking, so you'll have to solve each level in a hurry.

The gameplay has less of a puzzle element than the original, and is more of a standard platform game - to whatever extent a game in which you can become an all-conquering Terminator Putty, must face pups throwing grenades at you, and can use Uncle Ted to play a tune to distract enemies can be seen as a 'standard' example of anything.

You take control of the same amorphous blob as before, which has the ability to 'stretch' left and right (using this as a weapon which kills on contact) and to stretch upwards to make jumping easier. He can also explode himself and absorb other objects, even becoming them physically to gain an advantage.

There are stars littered around the level, and collecting these upgrades Putty's abilities, starting with a super punch for 10 stars, going up to the Terminator ability for 40. 

The pups from the previous game are no longer on your side, and are out to get you. These have all manner of abilities - shooting mortar bombs at you, paradropping towards you, and even flying a helicopter.</resource>

Depending on the aiming, the bubbles may float up directly or bounce off the walls, changing their trajectory. The goal is to aim the bubbles in such a way that they will touch identically colored ones. When such bubbles form a group of three or more, they pop and disappear from the screen.

If the ceiling of the area is covered by too many bubbles, it will gradually descend; the game is over when it nearly reaches the player-controlled pointer. Should the player fail to release the bubbles within a specific time limit, they will be released automatically, unaffected by the pointer's aiming.

A two-player mode is included as well. Each player competes on an area occupying half of the screen, dealing with identically generated bubbles. Whenever a player successfully disposes of a bubble group, a part of it is transferred onto the opponent's part of the screen.

The game features the two dinosaur protagonists (Bob and Bub) as well as other characters from Bubble Bobble, even though the two games have distinctly different gameplay.</resource>

It is the third of five Super Famicom games based on the license.

The game sees the usual three ninja student protagonists, and their three kunoichi student opposites, involved in a series of puzzle battles. In these battles, players match colored tiles in groups of three or more to remove them from their grid. Depending on the icons on the tiles, different effects occur, such as bombs removing adjacent tiles in an explosion. The goal of these battles is to outperform the opponent: points are earned through combos and chains, many of which drops junk tiles on the opposing player. If both players survive to the end of the time limit, the one with the highest score wins the round.</resource>

Nichibutsu. The protagonist's village is suddenly attacked one day by a demonic presence that drops hundreds of colored blocks on the panicked citizens. The hero decides to fight back by removing them all and defeating the demon.

The game is a combination of Puzznic and Sokoban/Boxxle. In order to remove these blocks, they need to be lined up with blocks of a similar color. Pushing a block causes it to keep moving until it either hits another block or a wall. The stage can only be completed if every block is removed, so the player needs to be careful not to leave remainders: while lines of three are sufficient, if there's four or five blocks of the same color the player needs to figure out how to line them all up at the same time.</resource>

    <resource id="360632c5551b20a1e01e6f2b16fce895dd1a53fd" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">RPM Racing was preceded by Rareware's R.C. Pro-Am in 1988 and Electronic Art's Racing Destruction Set in 1985, with the latter being the larger influence. It is a precursor to Rock 'n Roll Racing, which was done by the same developer.

Combat, obstacles, and traction on the non-flat tracks play a significant role. There are 3 vehicle types to choose from that perform differently on pavement, dirt, ice, flat or bumpy tracks. Cars can be armed with oil, nitro, and mines. Additionally, there are 3 levels of tires, engines, shocks, and armor.

There are full race season, single race, and custom track modes. In 1 player games, the 2nd player is replaced with one of 8 AI opponents who are each associated with their own vehicle.

In season mode, each track has an entrance fee and cash prize for placing 1st; often lesser cash prizes for lesser placements are also awarded. For an additional fee, racers can opt to move to a higher racing class (levels) where fees and prizes are bigger. Each class has its own set of tracks that the player may choose from. No track is mandatory or unavailable within a class. The player also has the option of going back to a lower class for free, which may become necessary if funds are eaten up be fees without winning prizes. However, going up always incurs a fee, even if the player has been there before.

Custom track designing is not intuitive but fairly easy to learn. Players can set the track's laps, gravity, and starting line type. Each track section can be pavement, dirt, or ice. Track sections are laid out like puzzle pieces on a 2D non-isometric grid (Pipe-Mania style). Sections include horizontal and vertical straights, four standard 90° turns, eight T-sections for diverging and converging multiple paths in any direction, and a criss-cross. Either a horizontal or vertical special straight section is used as the starting grid. The starting grid can be oriented forward, reversed, face-off with player 1 forward, or face-off with player 1 reversed. 7 points are used to adjust the 6 slopes in straight sections to 5 different heights. Slopes can be flat (0:1), inclined (1:1), or steep (2:1). Non-straight sections can only be adjusted for height for the entire section at once. An isometric view of individual sections is provided to help to orient the section's design to the adjacent sections. If the edge of a section does not match the height of the adjacent section(s), the player is warned immediately but may proceed without correcting the error immediately. But such error must be eliminated before the track can be saved. Also required for a track to be saved is no dead ends, and a starting grid section. The track verification is surprisingly liberal, even allowing diverging and converging paths that are against the flow of traffic (like turning around and going the wrong way up a freeway merging lane). The AI opponents are generally not able to discern the fastest or shortest route and can even be diverted into a path with no natural exit, or with very clever path designs, valid lap paths can be entirely different for player 1, player 2, and AI players; which can lead to interesting traffic patterns.</resource>

The game consists of 10 levels set in the prehistoric age. Radical Rex can use a skateboard or glide down hills, jump, kick and breath fire. Tougher enemies need multiple hits and when burnt Rex needs to kick them once more to destroy them or use his scream (hits everything on the screen). While playing Rex collects eggs, health, power-ups for his fire breath and scream refills. Checkpoints are shown as torches that need to be charged with fire. After each level, there is a Bomberman-like sequence to earn an extra continue. Enemies include flies, turtles, toads and all kinds of dinosaurs.</resource>

The World Alliance of Nations has developed a supersonic attack fighter, Raiden, to defend the Earth. A pilot must take control of the experimental fighter to destroy the alien warships that just happen to look like odd variations of typical military tanks and planes with gadgets attached to them. 

Raiden (called Raiden Trad on the Genesis and SNES) is an over-head vertical-scrolling shooter, based on an arcade game of the same title. It features two forms of weapon upgrades and two types of missiles (normal or homing). You start the game with several bombs which you can use to destroy most enemies on the screen to get yourself out of a jam. Each level ends with a large boss or bosses.

As in previous games the premise simply involves the cast of the series going at each other's throats for ultimate supremacy, although this time you can select any character in either the single player or Vs gameplay modes.

The gameplay itself involves controlling your character in a side-scrolling arena and trying to defeat your opponent either with your basic attacks, special moves (triggered by specific controller motions) or super moves that require you to charge buttons and can only be dealt under specific situations (ie, when your life-bar starts flashing), while avoiding your opponent's attacks in turn.

    <resource id="0d78babba2a30575c166d35f800ce2c17f7885ea" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">The game is based on the animÃ© series Ranma 1/2. It tells the story of the young martial artist Ranma Saotome. Traveling with his father Genma across China, Ranma discovered a cursed spring. When he and his father fell into that spring, they were both transformed: Ranma into a little girl, Genma into a panda bear. Hot water restored them to their original appearance, but whenever they are splashed with cold water, they turn into their &amp;quot;cursed&amp;quot; forms. 

The story of the game begins as Ranma and Genma are having breakfast by their friends. Suddenly, several cat-like creatures burst in and kidnap Genma. Ranma finds out that the cats belonged to Akaneko (Crimson Cat) Gang, who kidnaps strong fighters for some reason. Soon Ranma discovers that Kamusaru, the leader of the Crimson Cat Gang, is looking for an ancient treasure that will allow him to turn into a Nekomaou (Cat Demon King), and take over the world. Ranma and his friends will do anything to rescue Genma and to stop Kamusaru's evil plans!

The game features many characters from the animÃ©, including Ranma's fiancee Akane, the fighter Ryouga, the amazon warrior Shampoo who is in love with Ranma, and others. The game is built like a traditional Japanese RPG: your party fights random enemies in turn-based combat viewed from a third-person, Final Fantasy-like perspective. In battles, you can attack physically, or use various offensive and defensive techniques, which consume &amp;quot;ki&amp;quot; (an equivalent of magic points). Not only Ranma and Genma, but also the other characters in your parties can take a different shape. You carry around a bucket of cold water, and every time you use it on one of your characters, he/she is transformed into a &amp;quot;cursed&amp;quot; form. This is sometimes required to advance the story of the game (for example, Ranma can enter a certain location only as a girl).

Ranma 1/2 : Chougi Ranbu Hen pits 12 characters from the series (including the male and female versions of Ranma) against each other in best 2-out-of-3 rounds matches, with the goal being to defeat all the opponents and thus claim a magical lucky cat that will grant the champion whatever he wishes.

Gameplay involves controlling your character in a 2D scrolling arena, in which you attempt to defeat your opponent by using your basic attacks and special moves, all the while avoiding your opponent's strikes. You can also charge up your character until he reaches &amp;quot;super&amp;quot; mode, which allows you to unleash super moves for extra damage, but performing any basic attack negates the super mode.

Features the standard single player and Vs modes along with a Tag Team Vs mode in which two players select a pair of characters and can exchange them in mid-fight for strategic advantage.</resource>

In a similar manner to Tetris, the player can rotate the blocks to stack them, using pieces that defeat other pieces (e.g. paper over rock) to eliminate stacks. Doing so adds garbage pieces onto the opponent's screen to make it more difficult for them to eliminate their stacks of blocks. The objective is to fill up the opponent's screen up with blocks so that additional ones can no longer fit. Each character has two special attacks which can be used when large combinations are completed. Once in each round each player can also use a bucket of water that can transform a cursed character into their alternate form, which weakens their attacks until the effect wears off. This does not affect Akane or the Gambling King.</resource>

A prototype ROM exists, but is extremely incomplete to the point of being unplayable. For instance, the opponents are frozen in place, and the player is unable to shoot or score points.</resource>

Out of this chaos, Earth's last hope has arisen with a Biomech cyborg that travels through the five realms (levels) of the game in order to destroy the alien menace and bring humanity back from the brink of annihilation.

The gameplay is a side-scrolling action game, where the player travels throughout stages using weapons such as lasers, heat-seeking missiles and plasma boomerangs to destroy the various enemies scattered throughout the stages and face the standard huge menacing bosses to advance to the next level.  Power-ups can also be picked up that range from weapon upgrades to crystals that can produce a temporary shield to protect the player from enemy fire.</resource>

    <resource id="fdb95c2079228b23bfbd409ceade558c76023bf2" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">This game is quite different not only from the GameBoy title  Aretha 3, but also from the first two Aretha games for the SNES. &amp;quot;Rejoice&amp;quot; is a semi-serious, semi-comical RPG that is only loosely connected to other Aretha games. The heroes of the game are four thieves who live in a small village, occasionally robbing people, and exploring ancient ruins in search for treasure. One day, a terrible flood drove the village inhabitants out of their houses, and one of the thieves, Treno, was washed away to a sea shore, near a forest. There, a mysterious old wizard found Treno, and the two ventured into the forest to find the way back home. As the plot thickens, the heroes discover that none else but the Demon King Howard is plotting an evil scheme, and they are the only ones who can stop him!

Unlike other Aretha games, &amp;quot;Rejoice&amp;quot; is not a turn-based, but an action RPG. Monsters roam the game world, and you fight them by using weapons with elemental charges. You can pause the game at any time, access the menu, use items, and also switch characters. You can also jump, although this ability is not an integral part of the gameplay. You visit towns and can buy weapons, armor, and items in stores.</resource>

It's a great day for baseball!&amp;quot; And you'll hear that very statement along with dozens of others from the actual, digitized voice of Jack Buck, one of the most famous baseball announcers in history. Jack Buck's play-by-play is just one of many great features that makes Relief Pitcher one of the most realistic baseball games ever produced for the Super NES.

Take the long walk in from the bullpen and toe the rubber in a tense, game-saving situation as the stopper, or take it right from the national anthem as the starter. And don't let the game title fool you - Relief Pitcher won't take the bat out of your hands! You'll be taking your cuts in the batter's box too, as well as fielding, throwing, and running the bases.

Fastballs, curveballs, knuckleballs, changeups and more. Power swings, suicide squeezes, steals and double steals, sacrifices - even the infield fly rule. Relief Pitcher has it all!</resource>

Ren, who is always on the lookout to get rich, eagerly gets to playing with the video game system on the quest to earn big bucks. 

In the game, you control Ren &amp; Stimpy through various side scrolling levels which are based on different episodes of the cartoon show.  Episodes the levels are based on are Space Madness,Out West, and Robin Hoek. 

In Space Madness, Space Cadet Stimpy must get a dazed Ren to the sick bay to feed him some chicken soup to cure him of his space madness. You will guide Ren through the Space Diner, the Laboratory, the Button Room and the Zero Gravity Bathroom to get to the sick bay. There are also parts of this level in which you will control the spacecraft that involves side scrolling shoot em up gameplay.

Out West pits Three-Fingered Hoek and Stimpy the Kid, in the role of horse thieves. You must guide the buckeroos through the outskirts of town, past the corrals, through the rusty frontier town and to the stables, where you'll find the sheriff's horse to steal.

During Robin Hoek, Ren is the finest archer in all of Logwood Forest. Armed with trusty bow and turkey baster, you must make your way through the village and rescue the fair Maid Moron from the clutches of the evil sheriff, who is holding the maiden captive in his castle.</resource>

You start as the dimwitted cat Stimpy who has to search through the different levels of a firehouse to find these objects to proceed: a helmet, hose, pair of socks, rope, trampoline, uniform, and a beaver(!).  They all have to be placed on a fire truck before time runs out.  You can jump, climb up stairs and firepoles, and grab items while avoiding or putting out fires with water and eluding a speedy fireman by painting yourself like a dalmatian to avoid getting thrown out. 

A short 30 second bonus round follows where you must find Ren, the psychotic chihuahua.  This is followed by another 30 second round to bounce as many bags of Gritty Kitty Litter into a bin as you can.

The second level has both Ren and Stimpy holding the trampoline to catch objects falling from a burning building.  Again, there is a time limit by which all items must be caught.  If successful, you return to the firehouse again the next day and must survive a week to gain the award of the Sacred Golden Fire Hydrant Helmets.</resource>

There is an evil nation putting the youth down and banning our beloved rock music. Who you gonna call? Aerosmith!

Almost all of the graphics are digitized and Aerosmith themselves are too! There are also lots of fmv videos.</resource>

Rex must be asking himself, &amp;quot;My parents put a mortgage on their house to put me through eight years of medical school just so I could scrub tar off someone's lungs like a window-washer?&amp;quot;  But it gets worse: Big Tobacco, pre-emptively attempting to silence the turnabout whistleblowing revelation they anticipate in the unlikely event of this salesman's recovery, have some shrinking technology of their own, and have introduced sinister nanobots into his body to ensure his -- and Rex's -- untimely demises.

Washing off goo and attempting to survive the robot sprites' poor collision-detection routines comprise the large part of this game (albeit in exotic, well-rendered environments such as The Mouth, The Heart, The Lungs, and eventually The Brain -- where you struggle to clean up regenerating blobs of nicotine addiction); sporadically you also encounter mines which grill you on smoking-related health facts and myths, rewarding correct answers and blowing up when presented with falsehoods.  Though the majority of the game plays like a 2D platform shooter, there are also over-the-shoulder 1st-person inter-level sequences where you pilot a futuristic vessel through bronchial tubes and blood vessels like something out of Space Harrier or Tempest -- only with more globs of diseased sputum zooming straight toward you.</resource>

The HUD contains damage and energy meters along with a miniature ring up the top of the screen, useful to see the player's position in the ring so as not to get backed into a corner real easily.

Players can compete in the standard, 1-Player v. CPU, 1-Player v. 2-Player or even a career mode, where there are four preset fighters to choose from along with an option to create customers boxers. The career starts out at position #25 in the ranking and players slowly work up the ladder, going to the gym in between bouts to build up stats to eventually take on &amp;quot;Big Daddy&amp;quot; himself, Riddick Bowe.

The game is practically a copy of Evander Holyfield's Real Deal Boxing, save for the graphics style and the included fighters.</resource>

There are 20 boxers and two hidden characters. There were only six voices for all the 22 boxers, voice actors in this game include Daisuke Sakaguchi, Tetsu Inada, Hiroshi Kamiya, Shinichi Yamada, Ito Asako, and Atsushi Kisaichi.

Ring ni Kakero is a simulation of amateur boxing rather than professional boxing. Like in real boxing, there is a timer for each round. The game uses a manga outlook to the boxing scene as two fighters appear to fight using various cutscenes for action shots. Each boxer has a special move and an energy meter in addition to a stamina meter.</resource>

You play as the cyborg Eco35-2, half-man half-robot, created by the Electrocorp company, in order to counter the mutiny that is brewing in their Metropolis 4 factory, following the reprogramming of certain robots by injecting them with the EGO virus, making them aware of their situation and therefore aggressive. You will have to fight them one by one in duel battles to stop this rebellion.
The title was intended to be graphically revolutionary. But although the fighting robots are quite nice (with 3D sprites transcribed in a 2D universe), the scenery is only in dull static 2D. Also, the in-game animation is slow, even quite &amp;quot;heavy&amp;quot;, directly impacting the handling. 
The slowness of your robot and the varying power of the enemies (to the point that some robots are ultra powerful and atomize you in two shots) quickly make the fights unbalanced.</resource>

Living in Rococo is a famous inventor, Dr. Akihabara and his son. All is peaceful until suddenly a group known as &amp;quot;Hackers&amp;quot; appear and begin causing trouble. The Hackers and their robotic monsters take part in robberies, vandalism and destruction around the world. Dr. Akihabara leaves on a voyage determined to thwart the Hackers plan, leaving his son behind in Rococo. As strange things begin to happen in and around Rococo, Akihabara's son decides to investigate.  Idolizing his father and also wishing to grow up to be an inventor, he builds himself a robotic fighting machine and sets out on his Robotrek...

Robotrek a fantasy RPG with sci-fi and steampunk elements. Player's take the role of Akihabara's son, living in his lab at Rococo. The majority of the game is an overhead view, traveling through areas, talking to people and using items. Early on in the game, the player will learn how to create a robot in the laboratory and will use this this robot in a side-view battle mode to combat monsters and gain experience. The robots can be upgraded and equipped with different types of weapons, both found and invented. The player can have a total of three different robots to choose to send to battle, which allows customization strategies for certain situations and enemies.

Akihabara's son will also need to think up new inventions to thwart the challenges in front of him. He gets the ideas for these inventions from talking to people or witnessing events which cause a lightbulb to go off above his head. New items then become available for production in the lab. Also, many existing items including his own inventions can be combined properly in the lab to create new items and weapons. Items no longer wanted can often be turned into scrap which sometimes is also able to be combined.</resource>

In order to find Melody, Rocky Rodent has to complete a number of fast-paced, side-scrolling platformer levels. While he can also defeat enemies by jumping on them, his most important weapons are four different hairstyles: His first hairstyle allows him to skewer and throw his enemies, destroy porous blocks as well as cling to and jump up certain ledges. A mohawk can be thrown at enemies like a boomerang or thrown into certain walls, from where it serves as a trampoline. Braids can be used as a grappling hook and a corkscrew-like haircut lets him bounce on his head to jump higher than normal. When Rocky is attacked by an enemy, he looses his current haircut. If he is attacked while not wearing any special haircut, he looses a live.</resource>

In  Roger Clemens MPV Baseball players play a standard a 9 innings baseball game in Exhibition mode and a full regular season can be played including the World Championship Playoffs in the Regular Season mode. While playing in Regular Season mode the player can see their chosen team’s progress by using the in game calendar showing all the games.

Players select a fictional team from the following groups:

1. National Division West: San Francisco Quakes, Los Angeles Apaches, Cincinnati Big Cats, San Diego Suns, Houston Mustangs, and Atlanta Condors.

2. National Division East: Chicago Swords, Montreal Lumberjacks, New York Buffalos, St. Louis Commandos, Pittsburgh Panthers, and Philadelphia Generals.

3. American Division West: Oakland Bashers, Seattle Pioneers, Minnesota Hounds, California Waves, Texas Cowboys, Chicago Red Birds, and Kansas City Kings.

4. American Division East: Toronto Bears, Boston Hornets, New York Rebels, Detroit Wheels, Milwaukee Marshals, Baltimore Eagles, and Cleveland Tomahawks.

Each team has a set of players the make up the team each with their own skill level and statistics which, like the teams, is fictional other then Clemens himself who is on the Boston Hornets team. 

When controlling the pitcher the player can control the speed and spin of the pitch as well as the pitchers position on the plate. The pitcher can also stop the opponent stealing a base which can be seen via windows showing the positions of all the baserunners. When controlling the batter the player has to time the hit to successfully hit the ball so it will not be a missed hit or a foul, or has the option to not hit in case of a ‘ball’.  The player can also steal a base while batting. After the ball is hit the game goes into fielding mode where the camera shifts to a view that is lower than the normal 45 degree angle (the fielder gets smaller as he moves away from the camera). The player then controls the closest fielder to get or catch the ball and then throw it to the selected base. There are many different cameras angles that the game selects depending on the location of the ball. The camera can be on the left, center, or right side of the field in ether infield or outfield position and all cameras can pan to follow the ball. 

The player can use a password to save their progress in Regular Season mode. An exhibition match can be played in two player mode with the use of two controllers.</resource>

He has a reputation as a powerful fighter among delinquent gangs as a result, though despite being violent he has a code of honor.

The Famicom and Super Famicom versions of the game are subtly different due to console differences, but both share their genre, developer and publisher. The Famicom game was released in October 1993, with the Super Famicom version following in April 1994.

Characters from this game have appeared in Jump crossover games, specifically Famicom Jump II and Jump Ultimate Stars.</resource>

RTK can be said to be much more 'stable' where players no longer have to worry that much about time length in the game, as the game take a slower time rate to allow the players to build up their forces without much interference.

Many years ago, four great races dominated the Earth: the wise Danans, the beautiful Mermaids, the proud Reptiles, and the strong Giants. But those races had to give place to a newly born race: the humans. During the era of the humans, the planet's air has become filled with smog and the water dirty with pollutants. The cult of the Rudra have appeared and begun fortelling the end of the world. As the 4000 year deadline approaches, three characters each embark on their separate yet intertwined quests.</resource>

Proud of the warrior traditions of their family, Borgan sends Arm to retrieve a powerful sword from the depths of the dungeon Arff. When Arm returns home, he finds the village attacked by soldiers from as hostile empire. His father loses his memory, and he has to find a magical herb to cure him. The king of Rondium and his court magician send Arm and Linda on a quest to find out more about the attack, and Arm discovers the secrets of the ancient Mediom empire and its evil emperor.

This is an action RPG in which you control Arm and his party. You can either let the computer AI handle the actions of the other characters, or control them on your own, one at a time. In battles, characters have their own attacks: Arm uses physical attacks, Linda casts magic, etc. The dungeons are complex, and many of them have puzzles that you can solve by making two characters co-operate.</resource>

He hopes to create new functions in nature that will remove the pollution from the Earth before it is too late. Unfortunately Dr. Bruford's experiments go wrong and genetic monsters are unleashed upon the world. The only thing that can stop these creatures are Dr. Bruford's previous achievement: Genetically enhanced warriors known as the Run Sabers. Two of the Run Sabers, Sheena and Allen are ready to activate.

Run Saber is a side-scrolling platform game similar in gameplay to Strider. Players assume the role of one or both of the Run Saber characters. Choosing either Sheena with her Ice powers or Allen with his Thunder powers, players must defeat mutant monsters. The Run Sabers can move side to side, jump in the air, attack with a sword, climb along walls or roofs, slide across the ground and drop-kick. Additionally, each character has a special move, which damages everything on the screen with either Ice or Lightning, and which can be activated by collecting orb power-ups. Other power-ups include small health, large health, extra life and a larger sword. Players progress through 5 different levels, often encountering powerful boss and miniboss mutant creatures.</resource>

Many of the problems that existed in the first game have been fixed in this installment (it is easier to execute special moves, you no longer have only Ryo or Robert to choose from in 1 player mode, etc.).

The entire cast from the first Art of Fighting is here (with the exceptions of Todo and Mr. Karate), along with a few new characters: Takuma Sakazaki, Ryo and Yuri's father; Yuri Sakazaki, Takuma's daughter and Ryo's sister; Eiji Kisaragi, a sworn enemy of the Sakazakis; Temjin, a Mongolian trucker; and a younger version of Geese Howard, whom you face as the last boss if you beat the game without losing a round.</resource>

You set off in your little submarine and board the ship where a horde of passengers desperately need your keen oversight and &amp;quot;shipsmarts&amp;quot;.

In 60 levels you have to rescue as many passengers (dubbed the Dim Passengers) as possible. At the beginning the passengers fall through a tube in the level. Similar to Lemmings you have to find a way for the passengers to the exit of the level. In order to do so, you must blast hindrances such cargo boxes and bulkheads with bombs or, when no bombs are left, reposition the boxes with a crane. There are also conveyor belts in the levels. If the belt moves in the wrong way, the passengers either can't use it or may even be transported to their dooms, being dropped off into water, fire or steam jets. You can usually choose the direction of the belts by pulling a lever.

There are several types of scenarios that Kevin Codner (you) are faced with throughout the game. Of course the puzzles get progressively more difficult, involving things like patching up cracked pipes to stop a lethal jet of steam from cooking the distressed passengers. You can blast away obstacles and stack crates in creative manners. For instance, you can have them fall onto each other to form a bridge across a gap or to provide shielding from fire. This is usually done by hoisting them onto conveyor belts using a crane.

Each level has a certain &amp;quot;save limit&amp;quot;, meaning you have to save at least a certain amount of passengers. This again is akin a bit towards Lemmings, and lots of levels have a built-in time limit, represented be water pouring into the compartment, rising ominously. When the water rises high enough, the passengers will get carried along with it, and they can only swim for a short period of time before getting exhausted and drowning, so you'd better be on time with some assistance.

At the end of each level you receive a password (again, Lemmings-style) so that you may pick up your game from the current level without having to progress through them all from the get-go.

Rather than featuring real teams and drivers from Formula 1, it features ten anthropomorphic characters riding very small versions of the various Formula 1 open-wheel vehicles. It still features the licenses of FOCA and Fuji Television, two organizations that control the Formula 1 licensing rights in Japan.

The game is loosely inspired by Super Mario Kart and its imitators. The game depicts the course from behind the player's vehicle, with the second half of the screen taken up by either the second human player (if applicable) or an overhead map of the course and the progress of all the competitors. Uncommon for a cart racer, SD F-1 Grand Prix allows the player to earn money based on how they ranked and use that money to upgrade their vehicle between races.</resource>

When four blocks of the same color are adjacent to each other, though not necessarily in a straight horizontal or vertical line, they are destroyed and disappear. Placing four differently-colored blocks in a row will also cause them disappear.</resource>

The player can choose to play one of the game's many scenarios, each of which has a pre-determined map and number of allied units and enemy units, or they can opt to create their own campaign. A campaign can be configured by the player before it begins, including the number of turns, the number of CPU opponents, each side's starting capital and the banners of each side.</resource>

The player can go to school once per day to enact various events involving Hitomi, or train Hitomi in a dungeon, all of which involves plenty of adult content.

    <resource id="03601a6d2ed050691b27763a60eaf84bec202ca8" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">The date is Tuesday, September 13th, 1921.  It's a stormy night, and the luxury ocean liner &amp;quot;Lady Crithania&amp;quot; is about to be capsized by an enormous wave.  Many of its crew and its 2300 passengers will be killed outright in the initial overturning; in the transfigured catastrophic ship environment, most of the remainder will be unable to locate, reach and secure a safe exit from the sinking ship before it floods entirely.  Will you?

Inspired by Paul Gallico's 1969 novel The Poseidon Adventure, this game puts the player in the shoes of one of four denizens of the fated vessel: Capris Wisher, architect; Redwin Gardener, counselor; Luke Haines, sailor; or Jeffrey Howell, doctor.  Each of these gentlemen possess certain exclusive skills and distinct backstories and motivations -- a successful strategy toward winning the game will vary greatly depending on which character you initially select to play.  And just how is the game won?

Here's a hint: don't be on the ship when it goes down for the last time.  Accomplishing this demands mastery of a new skill hitherto untapped by its platform-game spiritual predecessors Prince of Persia and Flashback: exploring and navigating the ship in both an upright and an upside-down position, as well as many of the gradiated permutations between -- thanks to dizzying Mode 7 abuse, the game environment will tip, tilt and skew at predictable (and predictably inconvenient) intervals, granting access to some hitherto unreachable areas (those doors at floor level are of little use when you're on the ceiling!) while denying access to other portions of the ship you perhaps intended to go back through.  You're going to need to recognize where you can and can't -- yet -- reach, and make a note to revisit when the pendulum swings the other way.

You're not going to make it out on your own.  A successful evacuation is going to require the assistance of other survivors.  Supposing you can find ( -- and reach!) them, you're still going to have to safely lead them past obstacles and hazards (as the ship flip-flops on its way to Davy Jones' Locker)... and as with all NPCs, they're slower and less agile than you, necessitating plotting out the simplest, safest course possible (... given the circumstances.)  Which of the endings you conclude with will be determined by who you rescue and how many of them there are -- but I'm sure you'll have your hands full the first few dozen play-throughs just staying alive and trying to figure out how to get to where you're supposed to be going.

Did I mention there's a time limit of one measly hour?  For once, it's your friend; since your injury in this dangerous and unpredictable environment is so frequent and, indeed, inevitable, death has been replaced by a deduction of 5 minutes from the time remaining -- but no matter how safe and dry a hidey-hole you manage to find, when the countdown reaches zero, it's game over.

Hope you packed a towel!</resource>

The Swat Kats are a trio of mechanics by day, but secretly also a group of superheroes defending their home, MegaKat city, from creatures and evil villians. Swat Kats is essentially a side-scrolling action game. You start off using T-Bone and Razor and guide them through 5 different worlds of action packed excitement. Game levels are based on different episodes of the show. As you progress through the game you can increase your weapon levels and gain new weapons. Mode 7 graphics are featured in some parts of the game. A unique feature to the game is the ability to start on different levels.

The game splits its time between strategic battles featuring multiple soldier units and an &amp;quot;adventure&amp;quot; mode where Liu Bei visits towns, discusses topics with NPCs, purchases new equipment and recruits for his army. 
During battles, players select which units to take into combat with them (though several major characters, like Liu Bei, are mandatory) and fight skirmishes with the enemy units. Depending on the player's choices in combat and in the adventure mode, the story may branch and they can end up fighting different battles.</resource>

The player assumes the role of a warlord and conquers territory from rival kingdoms. Unlike most games of its type, the campaigns play out in real-time and requires that players remain vigilant.

The game is based on Wolf Team's earlier game Tenbu: Sangokushi Seishi for the NEC PC-9801, which had many sequels on the same platform. Tenbu Spirits is an enhanced port built specifically for the Super Nintendo. A Sega CD variant, Tenbu: Mega CD Special, was created the previous year.</resource>

Ten wrestlers with different fighting styles and individual special attacks are available. They are controlled with three buttons; one for jumping, one for attacking and one for pinning. When close to your opponents, you can grab them to perform various moves ranging from ordinary attacks to body slams to throws. Since the action takes place in a ring, it is also possible to climb the turnbuckle or use the ropes to your advantage. You can also leave the ring for a limited amount of time to fight with different weapons that can be found outside the ring.

Apart from a standard Single Match mode, the SNES version also features a Battle Royal mode for up to four players. This mode is not available in the Genesis version, which features a Death Match mode that can not be found in the SNES version. A Death Match is a no rules match in which weapons can be used used and the rope is replaced with barbed wire.</resource>

While the gameplay is similar (exploring levels to collect clues and solve the mystery), there are four different episodes for this version.  While visiting the Drabwell Ranch, ghost's interrupt the festivities and the gang must find out who is behind the hauntings and why.  Another adventure takes the gang to Deadman's Cove where a ghostly pirate has been scaring off tourists and it is up to Scooby and the Gang to bring it to a halt. The other two mysteries take place at a fun fair and a haunted mansion.

Players can use Scooby's unique sniffing ability to find clues. Scooby also consume Scooby Snacks to reduce the fright meter.  Additionally there are a series of mini-games that player can participate in such as &amp;quot;Wac-A-Monster&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Make a Scooby Sandwich&amp;quot;.  The graphics are faithfully recreated to resemble the long-running Hanna Barbara series.</resource>

    <resource id="b01a35649eb22af5a5725f1fdc176f7df79861a5" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">You start out as a nameless boy and his dog, literally from the town of Podunk.  You chase the dog into an old abandoned mansion, where a scientist lived 30 years ago.  Some of his equipment is still operational, and when your dog chews on it, you're both sent to the strange world of Evermore.  Now you must try to get back.
The action-RPG gameplay is very much like Secret of Mana, with a few key changes.  Multiplayer is out.  Rather than three characters, there are just the two.  The equivalent of magic is alchemy, where each effect requires several base ingredients which you gather as you go along.</resource>

    <resource id="e59f2c91923a109993bec540d871a8dcba327f05" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Once upon a time, the power of Mana was used by all people and helped their civilization grow. But as evil forces took control of Mana Fortress, there was no way out but a war which destroyed the Mana-based civilization but eventually brought peace to people. The events of the past became but legends to the new generation of humans. But history repeats itself... One day, a young village boy finds a rusty sword stuck at the bottom of a river. He doesn't know this sword is the famous Mana sword, the one that won so many battles before. By drawing the sword out of the river bottom, the boy unwillingly summons hordes of monsters, and is expelled from his village. A mysterious knight Jema is the only man who helps him and gives him instructions for the future. First, he must repair the sword, and then, with its help, take control of Mana seeds which can be found in eight great castles.

&amp;quot;Secret of Mana&amp;quot; is an action RPG, featuring real-time hack-and-slash type of a combat. Like in Quest for Glory games, you have a stamina gauge. The more stamina you have, the more powerful your strike is. You upgrade your weapons and abilities and meet many different types of monsters, while roaming around the country and performing your quests.</resource>

    <resource id="4a52386f21458e8e0e15dab79b8622abeb354a29" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Trials of Mana is set in the same world as the two previous Mana games (Final Fantasy Adventure, and Secret of Mana). The mysterious power of Mana is also the center of all events in Trials of Mana. Years have passed, and all the destructive powers of Mana have been securely sealed by Mana Swords into eight seeds, all placed in eight different kingdoms. But some people know about those sealed powers, and they don't want to free them for the sake of humanity, but for their own gain - such as the kingdom of Altena, which is slowly freezing and which can be saved only by the legendary powers.

The game features several plot lines connected to each other by their common background. In the beginning of the game, you are offered to choose a group of three among six different characters of different classes: Duran the Fighter, Angela the Magic User, Lisa the Amazon, Charlotte the Cleric, Kevin the Grappler and Hawkeye the Thief. Each one of them has her/his own background story and dwells in a different land. Gradually, the connections between those different characters become apparent, and the seemingly loose story lines are connected into a whole.

Trials of Mana, like the previous game in the series, is an action RPG with real time combat.</resource>

Unfortunately for them they also get caught in a time-warping scheme caused by the evil Nobunaga who attempts to invade the time period with mythical warriors and evil creatures from the Japanese sengoku period.

The game thus takes you from the city to a spirit-realm from time to time, in which you must fight all sorts of Japanese mythical figures, and release three haunted spirits that can aid you in your battle. Collecting orbs from defeated enemies allows you heal up, gain weapons and even energy attacks and also summon the warrior forms of the spirits you released, which change your character's form and give you a new collection of attacks and powers.

The player selects one of the many daimyo (warlords) of the period and attempts to conquer the other territories. The game's full title is Sengoku no Hasha: Tenka Fubu e no Michi, which translates to &amp;quot;Supreme Ruler of Sengoku: The Road to Tenka Fubu&amp;quot; where Tenka Fubu was Oda Nobunaga's governing credo that roughly means &amp;quot;to rule the world with force&amp;quot; which he took up after announcing his intent to unite Japan through warfare.

The player can select to begin on various dates within the Sengoku period, starting with 1555 CE and leading up to 1600 CE. This simply determines the layout of the map dependent on who owns what prefectures at that moment in time. The Sengoku era officially ended in 1603 CE after the Tokugawa shogunate took total control over Japan.</resource>

Saunders' Combat! is a 1995 strategy game for the Super Famicom that takes an isometric perspective and liberally uses clips and images from the black and white ABC TV show Combat!, which ran from 1962 to 1967 and continues to hold the record for the longest running TV show based on the second World War. Sgt. Saunders was one of the major characters from Combat!, played by Vic Morrow.

In an unusual twist, Activision purchased the license to use it for video games, and permitted ASCII Corporation to publish the game in Japan first. The Japanese version of the game credits Activision for the use of the license. However, when it came time for the North American version of the game to be released, it was cancelled mid-production instead.

The game is reminiscent of many of other ASCII's strategy games; it has a lot of attention to detail regarding characters from the show and the vehicles and weapons that were used during WW2, and is deliberately paced.</resource>

    <resource id="031083a5469fc026934ec054ae01e0f766a6385d" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Shadowhawk is a comic by Image Comics (or rather their sister studio, Shadowline), a studio set up by people who worked for places like Marvel, but wanted to retain copyright of their creations. Jim Valentino was one of those people, and he created Shadowhawk, an anti-hero who went on a vendetta after getting attacked and infected with HIV. This comic came out during the explosion of the medium in the early 90s, and I have to admit that I was not into it at all.
Valentino, seeing the success of the 16-bit era consoles and a crossover with Shadowhawk's main audience, apparently decided to finance the creation of a video game. However, it never saw the light of day, much like other games based on lesser known comics, such as Prime and Firearm.
The game is split into two modes. It featured one or two platforming stages, followed by a Mortal Kombat-style boss fight. After beating each level, you get a cut scene with the story, and usually a hint at who the next boss is.</resource>

Having defeated hundreds of enemy soldiers, monsters suddenly appear and kidnap Aska. It is up to Shien to defeat them and rescue Aska from these creatures beyond the Time Gate.

Shien's Revenge is a first-person Operation Wolf-style shooter that puts the player in the role of Shien the ninja. Movement is automatically controlled by the game, which scrolls horizontally or vertically. The player must use his weapons, long-range shuriken (throwing stars) and a close-range dagger in order to defeat various enemy ninjas and creatures that appear on the screen. A set of candles indicate the player's life meter. Power-ups such as rapid fire and scrolls can be picked up by defeating enemies. The use of scrolls produces a powerful attack that damages everything on the screen. At the end of each area, the player encounters a boss who must be defeated through the depletion of its life meter.</resource>

Ace Striker was licensed by Italian Football League and AIC (Associazione Italiana Calciatori) featuring all clubs and footballers from the Italian Serie A (Season 1994â€“95).

The football players are drawn in the &amp;quot;deformed&amp;quot; anime style. There's no different formations to choose from, but all the players (except the goalkeeper) can be positioned anywhere in the field. During a football match, an animated image will appear whenever a goal is scored. One of the particularities or flaws of this soccer game is that during the penalty shoot-out, the goalkeeper can move and jump before the rival player actually kicks the ball.</resource>

One day, he has a strange dream: he is being sucked into another dimension, a strange maze-like structure. A spirit appears in front of him and asks him his name. As he proceeds further, he meets a man who is hanging on a cross, another one who is being tormented by a demon, and a mysterious young woman who is bathing in a pool...

&amp;quot;Wake up!&amp;quot; - the voice of his mother cuts through the dream. The young man wakes up and checks his computer. Suddenly, a message arrives: the world is headed towards destruction. Only he who can summon demons through a virtual space will be able to prevent a disaster. What could that mean? The young man goes outside and finds out a murder has occurred in the nearby park. The district must be cut off from the rest of the city until the murderer is found. This was the beginning of the demon summoner's story...

&amp;quot;Shin Megami Tensei&amp;quot; is a first-person RPG set in modern-day and futuristic Tokyo. The hero of the game can summon demons, who use a mysterious energy called Magnetite. The demons can fight for you and perform other useful tasks. The first-person combat is turn-based. In the beginning of the game, you can set the statistics of your party members, determining their strength, stamina, intelligence, etc. You'll need to make some crucial decisions during the game, that will also influence the outcome of its events.</resource>

The events of this game take place 20 or 30 years after the hero of the first game followed the neutral path, defeated the Asura Lord and the seraph Michael at the Cathedral, and founded a state where followers of both Law and Chaos ideals could live freely. But his reign of freedom doesn't last long. The Mesia faith gains power, expanding the Cathedral into a new enclosed environment named Millenium. The Gaians rise up, but their rebellion is repressed by the Mesians' elite warrior class, the Temple Knights. Some years later, a retired arena fighter Okamoto discovers a man fighting for his life against a demon. He rescues the man, who doesn't even remember his own name, and trains him to fight in the arena so they might both go on to a better living in one of the upper-class areas of Millenium. And thus the new battle for a better future begins...

&amp;quot;Shin Megami Tensei II&amp;quot; features all the gameplay innovations of the previous game. You can summon demons, fuse them, make them battle for you, talk to random enemies and receive information from them, etc. The combat is turn-based, and you explore the dungeons from a first-person perspective view.</resource>

The days of youth are flowing along. If... it was destroyed? If... this school was thrown into a separate world? This is the story of boys and girls who were suddenly thrust into the Demon World
and are now lost...

&amp;quot;Shin Megami Tensei If...&amp;quot; is a follow-up to the two classic SNES games. You choose your main character in the beginning of the game (by default it is the girl Tamaki, a character from the future  Persona series). Something weird is happening in the perfectly ordinary Karukozaka high school. One of the students made contact to a different universe that co-exists with modern-day Japan. With the help of your fellow students, you must investigate the matter and stop the insane plans of the student.

The gameplay contains typical Megami Tensei features such as demon summoning, demon fusion, and the ability to talk to enemies before (or instead of) fighting them. Enemies will react differently depending on your approach during conversation. The battles utilize a turn-based engine.</resource>

When he grew up, he defeated the evil demons from the Demon Island, and three years later found a way to save his land from the wrath of Emma, the King of Hell. But a new threat has appeared now! The demonic king Basara sends his henchman Karura to the moon, to kidnap Kaguya-hime, the legendary Moon Princess, in order for her to marry his son, Prince Daida. Momotarou prepares his magic carriage and flies to the moon, attempting to rescue Kaguya-hime. But he doesn't suspect how strong his foes really are...

The sequel to the first two Momotarou Densetsu games is very similar to its predecessors in terms of gameplay. Moving around Momotarou and his party members over the world map (which has become 3D by now), you visit towns, buy weapons and accessories, talk to people, and fight random enemies and bosses in turn-based combat viewed from first person perspective.

The eternal rebel Kunio and his pal Riki finally get to face the long arm of the law when they get both arrested for killing a couple of bystanders in a hit-and-run incident. Problem is they are innocent and   the lookalike killers are still out there! Kunio and his pal now have to break out of the prison and go kick some butt in the name of justice (and to clear their names of course).

Gameplay involves defeating all opponents using your arsenal of attacks and special moves (as well as any weapons you may find around) and completing the many side scrolling stages that make up the game, usually after beating an end level boss.

Kunio and Riki are not alone in their quest, as their hard boiled girlfriends, Misako and Kyouko, can join up and provide their unique collection of special moves to the mix. Biking sequences in which you try to get to another part of town while fending-off opponents  Road Rash-style are also added for additional gameplay and the game uses several non-interactive cutscenes and dialogues to carry the plot forward.</resource>

Chou Senshi in Tokyo Dome is the first game in the Shin Nippon Pro Wrestling series and was released in September of 1993. Varie developed two more Shin Nippon Pro Wrestling games for the Super Famicom: Shin Nippon Pro Wrestling '94 and Shin Nippon Pro Wrestling '95: Tokyo Dome . Other Shin Nippon Pro Wrestling games appeared on the N64 and PS1, which were instead developed by Yuke's.</resource>

It features multiple wrestlers active on the NJPW roster at the time, including both native and foreign talent. Like its predecessor Shin Nippon Pro Wrestling: Chou Senshi in Tokyo Dome (and its successor, Shin Nippon Pro Wrestling '95: Tokyo Dome Battle 7), the ring is depicted from a side view as wrestlers walk in from the two sides to start each bout.

The player can select between the Battlefield in Tokyo Dome event, the G1 Climax event (both of which are major annual events for the promotion), an IGWP Heavyweight Championship bout (a belt considered the highest accolade within NJPW) and a standalone versus battle. The Battlefield and Versus modes also allow for tag teams and multiple players.</resource>

Its roster includes many of the major talents involved with the promotion in 1995.

It is named for and based on the Battle 7 NJPW event which was the 1995 iteration of the January 4th show that the NJPW puts on every year at the Tokyo Dome. Battle 7 was the fourth iteration of the event. It would later be renamed a few times, but settled on Wrestling World in the early 2000s and later Wrestling Kingdom from 2007 to the present day.

The game includes a Battle 7 competition mode, which covers matches from the event, as well as a G1 Climax mode which is based on the August annual NJPW event of the same name. The game also includes standard Versus and Battle Royale modes, as well as a title match for the IWGP Heavyweight Championship belt. Every event has a singles or tag option, except for Battle Royale which is a four-person free-for-all.</resource>

SD Sengokuden and Shin SD Sengokuden recontextualizes the struggles of Gundam F91, V Gundam and G Gundam as fighting against a corrupt feudal lord in an alternate version of the Sengoku historical period of Japan. The game has the player raising mighty armies and taking on armies of enemy units in a turn-based strategy format reminiscent of Banpresto's Super Robot Wars series as well as many previous Gundam titles. The game doesn't have the standard system of one side moving all their units before switching control over to the opposing forces; instead, every unit has an active cooldown that the player can watch tick down as their next turn approaches. Some units are faster than others and can take their next turn sooner.</resource>

It is a traditional turn-based RPG, with the first-person combat view made popular by Dragon Quest and the earlier RPGs like Wizardry that inspired it. The protagonist is an amnesiac human woman (who the player names early on) that is rescued by a friendly dragonman during the game's intro.

The game was followed by a sequel, Shinseiki Odysselya 2, in 1995. Shinseiki Odysselya was intended to be released in the US with the name Lost Mission, but the localization project was canceled close to completion.</resource>

The game demo boots up to a Punk Development logo screen before heading straight into the action. Player One controls the red spaceship, Player Two, the blue. Both ships can fire with the B button and move up, down, left, or right around the strikingly phallic-looking space scenery. The game can also be paused with the Start button (although the starry background will continue to scroll). A few generic-looking space pods parade around as well as what can only be described as giant grasshoppers (spacehoppers?). Crashing into any one of these floating pieces of space debris will cause the player's ship to explode. Never fear, after going down in flames, a replacement ship will appear. Overall, this demo is very basic. A constant, low humming noise makes up the game's entire audio ambiance, unless if you count the single sound effect that plays during the opening. The scrolling level loops infinitely.</resource>

The player alternates between controlling the human Ashibe, as he escorts his friends across a world map while talking to NPCs and following the game's story, and the seal Goma-chan in 2D platformer stages where he must track down eight items by investigating his surroundings thoroughly. While Goma-chan can't be hurt by enemies, colliding with them causes him to lose one of the eight items he's already found - as the stages have a strict time limit, it's best to avoid this situation whenever possible.

Shounen Ashibe was originally a Shounen Jump serialized manga before becoming an anime TV series in 1991, a year before this game was released.</resource>

The game's title is a play on words on the common Japanese saying &amp;quot;Shounen yo, taishi o dake!&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;Boys, be ambitious!&amp;quot;, spoken by the American scholar William Smith Clark after helping to found the Sapporo Agricultural College in the 19th century.

To find a game that takes it as literally as this game does is harder to come by than one might think. Shuushoku Game is specifically based around the Trendy Drama sub-culture during the shift in its popularity from the mid eighties to early nineties when Japan was experiencing a &amp;quot;bubble economy&amp;quot;.

In this game, the player is part of a young team of white-collar Japanese workers and entrepreneurs in training who act as the player character's friends, rivals, and love interests, the main of which are in their early-to-mid twenties. The game ranges from doing everyday things such as hanging out with friends and grabbing drinks at the local bar to traveling to other cities, meeting bigwig business men with whom the player must make business proposals, and monitoring the business giants and making important business decisions to remain competitive. Despite the sound of it, the game isn't overly complex (and the ability to save between most events makes things easier).

Shuushoku Game will appeal to those into the whole &amp;quot;Trendy Drama&amp;quot;, soap opera business.</resource>

The game begins in 4000 BC. The player takes on the role of the ruler of a civilization, starting with only one settler unit and one warrior, and attempts to build an empire in competition with one to eleven other civilizations. The game requires a fair amount of micromanagement (although less than any of the simulation games). Along with the larger tasks of exploration, warfare and diplomacy, the player has to make decisions about where to build new cities, which improvements or units to build in each city, which advances in knowledge should be sought (and at what rate), and how to transform the land surrounding the cities for maximum benefit. From time to time the player's towns may be harassed by barbarians, units with no specific nationality and no named leader. These threats only come from unclaimed land or sea, so that over time there are fewer and fewer places from which barbarians will emanate.</resource>

After each stage completed (and some luck), a bonus stage will appear, as well as the chance to earn extra balls. You will only need a good target in the parquet block!</resource>

The first task is to place essentials such as housing, transport links, schools, factories and shops. There are 50 types of these, allowing for homes of all standards and different types of businesses. Make sure to consider which sites are effective for which tasks. Some power sources pollute, others don't but are more expensive. Taxes must be raised to ensure an income, and then portions allocated to public services such as policing and roads. Earthquakes, floods and fires are all emergency situations that must be dealt to contain any damage.

Successful mayoring will cause the small village to grow into a town, then a city and finally a metropolis. As the city's size grows so do it's needs. Commercial buildings may suddenly find that they need an airport to expand trade, or housing may find itself changing rapidly as vast amounts of people come and leave.

The game also includes 8 pre-defined time-limited scenarios, with specific challenges and targets. The environment varies in each game (especially if you have the Terrain Editor add on), and this should affect your choices.</resource>

This title adds numerous features over the original such as the ability of building &amp;quot;light&amp;quot; zones, subways, hospitals, colleges, zoos, and arcos which are actually cities in cities. You can now give names to places, and your city is surrounded by neighboring towns with which you can make trade. Finally, instead of the poll in the first game you now have the option of reading several newspapers to get an idea of your progress.</resource>

Players help foster new life and promote its evolution into lifeforms of higher intelligence. Guide civilization along the path of evolution until it can achieve Exodus, the ultimate goal of settling on another planet. The basic challenge of the game is to maintain a comfortable environment for the lifeforms by adjusting atmosphere and geological parameters. Small organisms called Prokaryote and Trichordate will grow and evolve into a multitude of lifeforms. Making a drastic change is a recipe for disaster. The key to success is to make small adjustments and see how the lifeforms react. SimEarth also includes planets with environments different from Earth, such as Mars and Venus. Try your hand at terraforming these planets with harsh conditions into a world where life can thrive.</resource>

The game provides a lot of information to players to help them decide on a winning strategy, including wind speed, batting averages and other statistics. When choosing a region on the grid to pitch to, the player can aim outside the &amp;quot;target zone&amp;quot; if they choose. When batting, the player can also send the command to steal bases with the four face buttons representing the four bases.</resource>

Forcing the people who live there to be his slaves, Sküljagger rules unopposed with an iron fist. A brave sailor named Storm 
Jaxon decides to rebel and steal Sküljagger's magical sword. Now he must fight for his life and ultimately to free the Westican people.

Sküljagger: Revolt of the Westicans is a sidescrolling platform game. Players select between a 1 player game, an alternating turn 2 player game or Bubblegum Practice. The player controls Storm Jaxon who is able to run left and right, jump and swing Sküljagger's magic sword. Storm must reach the end of each level before time runs out or risk losing a life. Under normal circumstances, touching an enemy or projectile will cause him to die, though the sword is often able to destroy projectiles. By collecting red jewels, Storm is able to both augment the sword with a projectile attack and be protected from one enemy attack. Green jewels will also protect from one enemy attack, however collecting 25 of them will grant an extra life. Blue jewels add additional time for Storm to complete each level. Finding a mask will make Storm invulnerable for a short time. These power-ups are either floating in the air of each level or hidden away in chests, boxes, rocks and coconuts. However these items which may hide items can also be picked up and thrown at enemies.

In addition to the power-ups listed above, fruity bubblegum can also be found. Only one bubble gum flavor can be carried at a time and it will be held until the player activates it. Grape bubblegum encases Storm in a giant invulnerable bubble that can bounce higher than jumping alone. Cherry bubblegum will require the player to inflate manually, but will allow Storm to fly. Beware as over inflating the bubble will pop it. Watermelon bubblegum will turn Storm into a projectile that damages anything on the screen, also gathering items. Orange bubblegum will let Storm spit out pellets at enemies which will destroy them. Bubblegum power-ups can be tested in the special bubblegum practice option of the menu.

The heroine of the manga (and of the game) is Lina Inverse, a seventeen-year-old girl who can use magic and is also proficient with the sword. Lina particularly likes money, and often robs rich people and hunts for treasure. She also has a sense for justice - if a village or a town is in trouble, Lina will do anything to protect it and to fight the bad guys! In the game, Lina is knocked down after a fight against mysterious attackers, and is found by the inhabitants of the nearby village. The trouble is, she can't remember anything! When she meets her long-time companion Naga, their first objective become to investigate the goblin attacks on the population, but Lina's ultimate quest is to regain her memory and to find out who or what has attacked her.

The game is a traditional console-style RPG with towns, dungeons, random enemies, and turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective, in a Dragon Warrior fashion. The characters can attack physically or use special attacks. Lina can also cast various magical spells. You cannot travel on the world map, but &amp;quot;jump&amp;quot; to various locations instead. The game features animé-style cut scenes.</resource>

Jerry moves by sliding across the ground and can latch on to walls and climb them. Jerry can also jump, stretch out to cling to ceilings, and also move at a faster pace. Jerry can consume balls that he finds during a stage and can then fire them out of his body at enemies blocking his path. Enemies can also be defeated by jumping on them and then flattening Jerry's body on them. Also, there are flowers that contain items for Jerry to collect. Items include life, which refills health, a 1-up that adds an extra life, and a seed, which will grow a climbable beanstalk when planted. If the player collects the scattered letters that appear in every stage that spell out the name Jerry, the player will earn two extra lives.</resource>

    <resource id="246c7dff7ae54bbdda81bee7e766c5d9737692e6" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Night falls at the Smurf Village. Inquisitive Smurf brings Smurfette along to Papa Smurfs' laboratory to see the Magic Crystal that allows them to travel to anywhere in the world, but suddenly Smurfette breaks it, and they are gone! Now they must face the challenges in all continents in order to retrieve all shards of the Crystal and return home.

A classic platformer, this title allows the player to choose between Inquisitive Smurf and Smurfette (there are no differences between characters) and collect all 10 shards scattered on the playfield.  There is a larger emphasis on exploring the levels rather than killing enemies (no score is given for them), so they can be avoided in most occasions, but if the needs arise, be dealt with a kick or in Mario fashion by jumping over them. Some shards can only be obtained by jumping on an enemy, using the sprint jump or using the scenario (ropes, or vines). While large falls don't harm the Smurfs, improper contact with enemies does. Each 1-up has four hearts, and at the fifth contact a life is lost and the player must restart the level. Once all lives are lost, the game is over - there are no continues. To fill the meter there are hearts and small Smurf icons scattered or hidden somewhere in the level, and on all stages there's a key that unlocks a bonus level if all three are collected at the end of the continent. In these bonus levels the player collects as much objects as possible which translate into hearts when the time closes. If the player fills the meter, a 1-up is awarded.</resource>

The player controls Woodstock and direct Snoopy as he performs all sorts of errands for different Peanuts characters. The player does a separate game for each character; some of them require him to do a little detective work, or to direct Snoopy to win a race, or to get a character to some place. The ultimate goal in the game is to get everyone in shape for Snoopy's concert. Games can either be played using stereo or monoaural sound.

The music was composed by Hirokazu Tanaka and Minako Hamano (??????),[2] in addition to arrangements of the familiar works of Vince Guaraldi known to longtime Peanuts fans. Many years later the game has been translated to English (by Aeon Genesis) and Portuguese.</resource>

Soccer Kid is a platform game with some unique elements.  As the name implies, you have to kill your enemies with your ball. Football-style tricks of keeping the ball in the air and under control are especially useful - headers and overhead kicks can be played with practice. You gain access to the pieces by collecting 11 Player Cards across each world.

Goemon has been captured and his friend Ebisumaru goes out to try to find and rescue him. In order to do so, he must traverse a series of maze-like levels avoiding obstacles and enemies and get to the end zone.

The game is played from an isometric perspective from which you can get a good view of the mazes and Ebisumaru. You have no direct control of Ebisumaru per se, but instead switch special blocks around the mazes that can change Ebisumaru's direction of travel and such. You must reach the end of each stage before time runs out, and get all the power-ups and items laid in each maze in hopes of getting to Goemon alive.</resource>

(&amp;quot;Graduation Extra-Story: Hey, Mahjong Present!&amp;quot;) is a mahjong game for the Super Famicom. It features a cast of highschool seniors from an all-girls school and their male homeroom teacher, who decide to play mahjong against each other. Despite the format, the game is not ecchi (adult) in nature.

The game is based on the Graduation (Sotsugyou) series of school simulation games. Many of those games featured the same cast, and the player (as their teacher) had to mold them into model students by tutoring them on their weak subjects. This game is designated as &amp;quot;bangai hen&amp;quot;, which means &amp;quot;extra story&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;bonus story&amp;quot; - a game not part of the core series, but related.</resource>

Will you be able to save Friel's subjects from their horrible fate?

Soul Blazer is an action RPG in the top-down style of The Legend of Zelda.  Like Zelda, battles are not turn-based - the player directly attacks enemies and dodges them.  As they progress, they also unlock special items which allows them to complete tasks for characters or access special areas (such as the Dream Rod, which transports you into someone's - or something's - dream).  Unlike Zelda, the game has an experience meter, and the player levels up and becomes stronger as they defeat enemies.  The game's unique hook is that there are &amp;quot;Monster Lairs&amp;quot; spread all over the land of Friel.  When they destroy all the enemies in a lair, they don't come back, and when they step on the empty lair, it restores part of the game world, bringing back anything from plants, to animals, to people, to buildings and more.  Each restored soul helps in some way - for example, the player can climb regrown ivy to reach new areas, reunite families by bringing back husband and wife, rebuild cities by restoring architects, and talk to characters to complete even more quests.

The player's main goal is to find six Stones, which allow them to gain access to the World of Evil, where Deathtoll resides.  These stones are guarded by key characters in different parts of the world, usually the rulers, who require the player to defeat a boss character to rescue them.  While most of the game allows them to progress in a linear fashion, there are certain souls that can only be restored by killing monsters that can't be harmed with their earlier weapons.  The player will need to find special weaponry and then backtrack to previous areas to rescue these souls.  It's also advisable to revisit previous locations, as certain characters may have new sidequests to complete which can reward them with new items to make them even stronger.</resource>

Stories can be saved either on a battery or through a satellite connection.

The game comes with a previously created graphic novel about exploring an old house. Due to the limitations in the game's engine, it can only show shadows of non-player characters that the player meets on his journey. Settings can range from a modern day train to a rural house and even wilderness can be included in various stages of wildness.</resource>

Naturally, Dexter cannot let this happen and sets out to stop Borf and rescue Kimberly.

While following the same story as the Laserdisc conversions, the SNES version of Space Ace obviously lacks the long video sequences of the original, and also features different gameplay. 

Instead of only pushing the right button at the right moment, the player has complete control over Dexter. Most of the time, he will be busy jumping over chasms and dodging alien attacks, but occasionally, an 'energize'-symbol will appear which, by pressing the correct button in time, will temporarily transform Dexter into his stronger alter ego and enable him to shoot at his enemies.

Once he boards his space ship, Dexter has to find his way out of a labyrinthine seen from a top-down perspective, destroying obstacles with the ship's laser and avoiding collisions.

In order to retain the atmosphere of the original, the SNES version features a large number of (short) death animations and the platformer levels always follow the exact same sequence, which results in a trial&amp;error-style gameplay somewhat similar to the original.</resource>

The hovercraft has the ability to accelerate, reverse, track the hoverball, and it can also fire at the opposing player to make him drop the ball if he's carrying it. If the player's hovercraft picks up the hoverball, they must try to get to the touchdown area within four seconds or else the hoverball gets automatically fumbled. Each game is played for a duration of 500 time units and the player with the highest score when the time runs out is declared the winner.

The playfield itself presents features that can affect the way the match is played. Some playfields contain things such as jumps, spinners, and force arrows which can help or hinder a players movement. 

There are a total of 12 drivers to choose from, with 4 per every speed level (slow, medium, and high).

It was released exclusively in Japan in 1995.

The goal of each stage is to defeat all the other opponents, though focusing on collecting power-ups is also important to overpower each stage's foes. Depending on the enemy vehicle type, they also have innate powers that the player does not. The player eventually faces a boss after a certain number of battle stages in each zone.

The game also features a multiplayer Battle mode, which provides a number of customization and stage options.</resource>

It is very different from the contemporary Genesis title Sparkster, as it does not continue the story from the first game and has completely different levels, enemies and gameplay mechanics. In that way it can be considered a spin-off in the series. The introduction merely shows how an elderly man captures a girl and takes her into his airship. At that point Sparkster appears and he decides to chase them.

Sparkster is a rodent carrying a rocket pack on his back. He can move around, duck, jump and hang from branches or rails. His regular attack is a sword slash that sends out a circular projectile. Through the L and R buttons he can dash left and right in a circle of fire. Keeping the attack button pressed powers up a rocket meter. When full, different types or actions can be performed: dashing left, right or up to cover a large distance, ricocheting off walls in a diagonal motion, or a stationary attack.

The game consists of nine levels of which the last two can only be accessed on higher difficulty levels. Sparkster collects diamonds for points, defeats all types of robot enemies and collects apples to restore his heart meter near the top of the screen. Most of the game consists of regular platforming gameplay, with a few diversions where Sparkster rides a robot bird, or is shown from a top-down view flying in the air like a vertically-scrolling shooter. All levels have a level boss along with a large number of mid-level bosses. The game supports a password system.</resource>

The game was later retooled and made into the game that is known as Kirby's Dream Course. It is unknown why the game was remade to feature Kirby characters, though it's presumed that it as because Nintendo thought that the game would prove more successful with a well known brand behind it.
The Satellaview video game had unique characters rather than already developed ones. Overall, however, the player character was uninspiring as it was simply just a red sphere that bounced around. Despite the fact that the game would be remade to feature Kirby characters, there are dramatic differences between the two titles, including the overall gameplay concept and levels. For example, in this game, the goal was simply to shoot the ball in the hole, while in the Kirby game you want to crash into enemies to destroy them. However, despite this, the games still share many similarities, such as graphics and the overall way the player controls the ball.

Interestingly, Special Tee Shot was featured not only in magazines but also on the back of SNES packages as advertisements before ultimately being cancelled and brought back with Kirby characters. It should also be noted that before being titled Kirby's Dream Course, the game was officially called Kirby's Tee Shot.</resource>

    <resource id="e8af8c6392a60427eb6b7928eb6ee7d37e25760f" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Spectre is a 3D shooter where the player drives a little red car/tank and blasts away enemies.  The gameplay is similar to Battlezone, and obviously inspired by it.

There is a selection of three tanks, each with three values (speed; armor; and firepower) balanced out to match its name: Tough Guy is heavy on armor, but slow and not very powerful; Speedy is fast, but low armor; and Balanced combines both strengths, but decreased. A fourth tank allows the player to design a custom variant.

Every level consists of a large plane filled with enemy tanks, several psychedelic walls with odd images that often flicker or warp resembling an acid trip, and tacky 3D models like windmills.  The object of each level is to either destroy all the enemy tanks in the level, or to collect all the flags. Every level has a certain theme to it, anything from plain green to a colorful blinking eye or images of sand dunes are to be found on the walls, windmills and flags throughout the level.

With every passing level, enemy tanks grow smarter and their rates of fire increases.  Also in later levels, new, smarter, more powerful enemy tanks join the skirmish. The player has a limited amount of ammo, but driving over ammo deposits replenishes a small amount of ammunition, as well as driving over shield deposits grants additional shields. The three different views (first, third, and top-down) allow the player to incorporate additional strategies into the battles.

The game boasts having supposedly an infinite amount of levels, though anything after level 80 is almost instant death.  A high score table is also included.

An additional note-worthy feature of this game is the multi-player mode. Up to eight players are supported over IPX, or NetBios (or two via modem or serial port). The network option offers three Cyberspace Scenarios: Arena - free-for-all battles, get one point for each opponent destroyed.
Flag Rally - a match point given for collecting six flags, destroy someone to get any flags being carried.
Base Raid - Akin to &amp;quot;capture the flag&amp;quot;.  Two teams, two bases; get match point for destroying opponent base.
The CD-ROM manual includes a &amp;quot;Cyberpunk story&amp;quot;, to give background information on the game which consisted of a cyberjock named Hart who lived for the battles in the Arena.</resource>

You play as Speed, an aspiring race car driver with his trusty car, The Mach 5, along with his GO team, out to travel the world and win every international grand prix on the circuit.

Along the way, you fight off the infamous villains of the series, out to stop Speed by any means necessary, even capturing his girlfriend, Trixie.  There are seven levels in all and in between racing levels you'll be on foot in a side-scroll style adventure, fighting off thugs and gangsters, collecting power ups to help you out, including green flags in order to keep your health up (not kidding about that).</resource>

Only Slowpoke escaped and sent for his cousin, the fastest mouse in Mexico... Speedy Gonzales! Following the trail of the Bandidos, Speedy will enter each level and try to rescue as many mice as possible while chasing after cheese and avoiding natural hazards. Ariba! Ariba!

The gameplay in Speedy Gonzales resembles the Sonic the Hedgehog series of games more than anything else. For the most part Speedy will run, run across fields and up slopes and into tunnels. There are also mousetraps which function similarly to Sonic's trampolines and will propel Speedy into the air. Speedy has a short range kick for attacking and can occasionally pick up items and use them at a later time.</resource>

Creating spells is a complicated process that involves finding components (powders, stones, jewels, etc.), mixing them according to a formula, and saying the magic word. Using a wrong formula will result in the player character's death. Besides the traditional attack and defense spells, the player can also create magic that modifies the terrain, and summon creatures that fight on the protagonist's side. Robert is just an ordinary guy - or so he thought before he received that fateful letter from a relative in England. Arriving at the mysterious Stonehenge, Robert is teleported to Valoria - a magical world populated by legendary monsters and wizards. And that is precisely what Robert has to become (a wizard, not a monster). Can he survive battles against evil creatures in the seven elemental realms of Valoria?</resource>

You start off with Spidey but in certain parts you get to choose between him and Venom, which takes you through an alternate routes. The gameplay is your standard beat-em-up, the regular punching and jump-kicking, with the addition of the all important webbing - ie web swinging, web shield etc.

Controlling GERALD, you must move through the isometrically viewed landscape (largely flick-screen on the ST). There are two skill levels; the harder one features more of the precarious ledges and falls of Spindizzy. Each one takes you to a different matrix of levels, which can be played in different orders and each consist of 10 screens, with a bonus level at the end.

You have limited energy, which can be recharged by collecting crystals. Fuel is limited, and is reduced by contact with hazards - generating a replacement GERALD takes time. There are many gates which are opened by running into spaces of the same colour. There are also aliens to avoid, and most movement is along thin slippery ledges with heavily inertia-based controls.</resource>

Each weapon has a powerful special power, but it is rarely used. Firstly because it requires a loading time and secondly because it uses up an energy bar.

The player must instill physical strength, tactical skills, and endurance in his bicycle racer just like a real coach would do. Bicycle racers become tired after training too hard; the coach must eventually assign free days when the athlete is tired. This would allow him to recover so that further exercise is possible. While spa vacations cost money, having the cyclist stay at home and rest cost nothing and accomplishes the same thing. Promoting the rider on television or other media may also bring in more money at the cost of training time.

As a male or female avatar, the player acquires horses and manages their training, entering them into races when they're ready and breeding them post-career to produce even faster horses. The races themselves offer running commentary on the race, letting the player know how well their horse is doing comparatively.</resource>

You play Benjamin Sisko, commander of Federation space station Deep Space Nine. When the station is attacked by Bajoran terrorists, your mission to uncover their plot leads you from DS9 to Bajor, beyond the wormhole and even through time itself.

Moving through the side-scrolling environments of DS9 and other places, Sisko must complete several missions like disarming bombs or rescuing hostages. If necessary, Sisko can use a phaser to stun enemies. To solve puzzles, he can use a tricorder and other items. The plot is often carried forward by interacting with other characters from the TV series.

The USS Enterprise is sent to monitor their activities and find out their real motives.

Gameplay is divided into three parts: commanding the Enterprise from the bridge, controlling an away team on a planetary mission and combat with other ships.

From the bridge you can control all of the ships main functions. Conn: Set course to a different planet or sector. Communication:  Communicate: with other ships. Sensors: Receive information on your surroundings or planets you are orbiting. Computer: Access a database that contains lots of information on planets, races, technology, your crew etc. Engineering: If the Enterprise got damaged during combat, you can use this command to allocate resources to the different parts of the ship that need to be repaired. Briefing Room: Receive orders and information on your current mission. Tactical Station: Engage in combat. Transporter: Assemble an away team and beam it down to a planet (which is only possible if your current mission requires it).

Before starting an away mission, you have to assemble a team of four crew members that differ in strength and in tactical and technical ability. Some crew members also have special abilities, Dr. Crusher can heal other crew members, Geordi and Data can see in the dark and Data can survive without air. Away missions are shown from a top-down perspective and you can control each team member individually or order different members to follow your currently selected character around. Most away missions are a mixture of simple (real time) combat and puzzle solving that usually consists getting hints from tricorder readings and finding objects that have to be used in the correct way.

Ship battles are also seen from a top-down perspective and let you attack enemy ships with phasers and photon torpedoes, while keeping an eye or your shields and trying to dodge you enemy's torpedoes. If your ship too heavily damaged you can surrender and hope that your enemy spares you.

While the SNES and Genesis versions are essentially the same games, there are some noticeable differences. The Genesis version plays considerably faster during ship battles and on away missions as well as on the bridge (meaning it takes much less time to repair the ship). There are many graphical differences and the map layout for away missions is slightly different from the SNES version as well.

It was developed by Axes Art Amuse and published by Hect, a company that focused on strategy and simulation games.

The player's squad is somewhat customizable and allows the player to equip different guns with various values for range, damage and magazine size. The player needs to make sure to make the best use of each soldier's weaponry, especially limited use items like grenades and RPGs, and ensure that they don't take too many casualties.</resource>

The action is viewed from behind your helicopter, with the 3D polygon world rotating around you, taking in mountains, rivers and deserts. 

There are 12 missions in total, each of which requires you to destroy targets in a set time limit. There are also training and head-to-head (against a CPU-controlled drone) modes. 

You have a limited number of automatically-targeting missiles as well as a cannon. A tracking map tells you where you are on the level, and where the enemies are.Contact with the ground, mountains or other vehicles will damage or destroy your helicopter.</resource>

Single player mode allows you to choose between two versions of the &amp;quot;hero&amp;quot; character (Steven) and then takes you through 7 best 2-out-of-3 matches against a collection of different martial artists. A 2-player Vs mode allows you to freely select any of the characters without restrictions.

Gameplay is similar to other one-on-one beat 'em ups, in which you control your characters movements and attacks in a scrolling 2D plane attempting to defeat your opponent with special moves (triggered by specific controller motions) and avoid his attacks.</resource>

New characters in this version include Gen (a wise kung-fu master), Rolento (who you may remember from another Capcom classic, Final Fight) and Sakura, a young school girl who follows her hero Ryu so close, she has the same type of moves. Dhalsim and Zangief also return to the fight with some news moves.

The other major difference is the loss of chain-combos and the gain of a custom combo system. Once you reach the required level (which is 1 at the least) you can execute a custom combo by combining any of the buttons (which there are 6 in total) or any of the special attacks (fireballs, etc.)</resource>

Unlike the original arcade and Playstation port, it features hand drawn 2D sprites in a style similar to the Street Fighter Alpha series. In fact, many portions of the sprites look as if they may have taken Alpha sprites and altered them heavily to appear as original creations. 
Although it is not mentioned in game, some PCB's have a sticker on them with a 1997 date. It is unknown when the game was first dumped into ROM format, but after being dumped remained unplayable until 2011 when a SNES programmer D4S documented and removed the copy protection. Since releasing the cracked version, new reprints of the game using the cracked ROM have surfaced. These differ from the original South American release by having a Japanese-style Super Famicom shell with a more professional looking label that features artwork from the original Sony Playstation version cover</resource>

Players select from one of eight characters: Ryu, Ken, Blanka, E. Honda, Zangief, Chun Li, Guile and Dhalsim to do battle with. They must then use their combat strengths to defeat the other seven fighters followed by four boss characters: M. Bison, Vega, Sagat and Balrog. Each character represents a certain country and has their own reasons for wanting to win against the others.

Each character contains his own selection of basic fighting techniques based on three styles of punches and three styles of kicks. The effect of each of these changes depending on the characters orientation (ducking, airborne or standing still). Street Fighter 2 made famous the &amp;quot;button combination&amp;quot; style of gameplay used to unleash powerful moves specific to each character. These include the ability to project fireballs, channel electricity or capture the opponent in a tight suplex.

Street Fighter 2 is one of the most cloned fighting games and its effects on gameplay and fighting games specifically can not be understated. Street Fighter 2 is responsible for making popular several different elements.</resource>

Instead of ice skates, roller blades are used as players can pick from nine different skaters and assemble their squad in a series of game modes.  There are five modes in all: Fat Point, Rush, Whack, Crammit and Hot Puck, each with their own rules, time-limit and scoring system (ex. Fat Point awards players different points by what kind of shot they scored the goal with).

There are six different environments to choose from ranging from empty swimming pools to construction sites filled with various obstacles that can stop the player dead in their tracks, but also has ramps so players can avoid the obstacles.  It also features multiplayer capabilities using an adapter to allow four friends to compete head-to-head.</resource>

The game features four modes of play: 
Speed Trax is basically an arcade mode where the player has to qualify for each upcoming race by reaching checkpoints while collecting items to restore his damage- and boost-bar. It is divided into a Novice-, Expert-, and Master class, with each class featuring four unique tracks.
In Stunt Trax the player has to complete courses filled with obstacles within a certain time limit while trying to collect as many stars as possible.
Battle Trax is a two player mode taking place on special tracks without any CPU-controlled opponents.
Finally, Test Run let's the player practice all tracks that have been unlocked.</resource>

Supapoon is inspired by games like Breakout and Arkanoid, but offers a few twists of its own, like being able to project the ball with additional power by using the &amp;quot;paddle&amp;quot;'s intrinsic elasticity, and a constant timer that ticks down faster whenever the paddle takes damage from skull drops or enemy attacks.</resource>

But all of a sudden, an evil magician turns your wife into a stone! As you begin to realize what happened, a bird grasps you and throws down somewhere on the island. You have to find your way back and to save your girl from the grim reality of petrification...

This emotional drama turns out to be a rather simple platform game. The short, linear levels are all timed, so you have to hurry up and not to get delayed by the many treasures you might find on your way. You will have a weapon, your old trusty boomerang, which you will be able to upgrade during the game. After a series on levels, you will be invited to a boss battle. The sooner you complete a level, the more bonus points you get.</resource>

But out of nowhere, a powerful tropical cyclone destroyed the idyllic mood of their honeymoon. And not only this: it separated the ardent lovers again. After the winds stopped blowing, Tina found herself somewhere on a tropical coast. As for Master Higgins, he went to the king of Waku-Waku and, along with his main quest to save his brand new wife, got an assignment to save also a princess, whom the king was about to marry. Is there a connection between those two events?..

No, this is not a detective/mystery game, but platform arcade action. What distinguish the game clearly not only from ordinary platformers, but also from the first Super Adventure Island, are its light role-playing and puzzle-solving flavors. You don't have a time limit, but huge levels with many secret sub-levels to find, puzzles to solve, and treasure chests to unlock. You also can have equipment, such as swords, shields, etc. By defeating enemies, you gain health items, money, etc. Your HP is measured by hearts, and it can increase during the game if you find appropriate items. You also encounter random enemies while traveling on a world map.</resource>

The general idea of the game is that the player is launched into a 3D war zone with the task of flying a fighter jet. The player must defeat enemies with various weapons like missiles and gunfire as quickly as possible while obtaining as little damage as possible. Altitude is judged in feet while speed is judged in the plane's Mach number. The player is given the choice between two Western-made aircraft: a F-15E Strike Eagle or a Mirage 2000.</resource>

Taking the role of a lone starfighter pilot, you are tasked with destroying an evil alien armada in standard 2D shooter fashion. And while you may be alone, you certainly won't be underpowered, with eight different types of weapons, each having six power-up levels for a grand total of 48 firing modes (not counting bomb power-ups) Super Aleste boasts one of the largest arsenals in 2D shooter history.

Gameplay is single-player only with 3 difficulty levels. Also included is a short campaign with different levels that plays mostly like a &amp;quot;survival&amp;quot; mode with the objective being to outlast the time limit and rack the most points.

In this side-scrolling platformer adventure, the gameplay is similar to Bonk 3. Super Bonk allows Bonk to travel through time from his prehistoric levels, the insides of a dinosaur, a version of modern Chinatown, and even the moon!  Along the way, Bonk can find power-ups that can change his form to creatures such as a shooting Bonk crab, a dinosaur form called &amp;quot;Big Kronk&amp;quot;, find candies that change his size from tiny to huge, travel through transportation tubes, and find multiple bonus levels.

Bonk still uses his head to smash his enemies, propeller seeds that allow Bonk to fly, and for the first time, can carry spring flowers on his head in his continuing battle against his arch nemesis, King Drool!

Unlike its contemporaries, the game does away with the premise of the player raising their own racehorses and is instead a details-heavy predictive engine. The player inputs the data of horses taking part in upcoming races, storing the data of over 100 horses simultaneously, and uses that data to predict which will win.

The game was the sixth horseracing simulation to be released for the Super Famicom in 1995 only three months into the year, making horseracing one of the most prolific genres for the system for that period. Though Copya System is not listed in the game's credits on the title screen, which instead credits both Teichiku and Asmik, the game shares many staff members with the contract developer.</resource>

During the 1 player game the player selects 1 of 13 fictional teams and plays the other 12 teams in a row. The overall goal, instead of just merely winning baseball games, is to play the perfect game and get a perfect rating. During a game, players start with an overall rating of a 100, and then after the game is finished game points are added or subtracted in 13 different rated categories such as number of errors made, the number of walks, pitched, number of times struck out, etc... The players final game points determines the difficulty level of their next opponent. The game has up to 5 difficulty rankings. Scoring a perfect 100 game points on a level 5 rated team will complete the game.

Both pitching and hitting are done from a behind the pitcher viewpoint and players can select whether to turn the designated hitter rule on or off.

The game also has an option to edit players.</resource>

Classic Battleship is the typical Battleship game where the players set up their ships on a grid, then take turns choosing 3 places at a time to target and hope they hit the opposing players ship. The game ends when all the opposing players ships are sunk. This mode contains four difficulty levels: Ensign, Lieutenant, Commander, and Admiral.

Super Battleship involves eight levels consisting of sixteen missions total. Missions include sinking enemy ships in a certain number of rounds, escorting ships to their destinations, defending cities from attack, and destroying enemy airfields. Gameplay consists of a turn-based moving of ships utilizing an overhead view. The player can then target any enemy units within the ship's range and attack. Attacking brings up an action sequence where both ships trade volleys of gunfire until one of them either sinks or retreats.

Much like its predecessor, the gameplay is a first-person tank simulation, using radar to scout out enemy tanks and using the main turret gun to disable and kill any opposing tanks, jeeps, APCs and various other heavy weapons including SCUD missiles.  If the player encounters and air resistance, they can mount their Phalanx machine gun to cut down enemy choppers.

Players also have smoke screens that can temporarily make them unseen to any enemy forces, plus they can call in supply drops to replenish their armor and ammo as well as air support that can level any opposing force in their wake.</resource>

Specifically, the game is based on the 44 episode 1992-93 anime adaptation with the same name, and features most of its cast of characters in the roster. The game includes two modes: a single-player elimination tournament against increasingly difficult computer opponents, and a versus mode for up to two players.

In the single-player mode, the player can only choose from two characters: Phoenix and Tiki. The two characters fight almost identically. They fight through the other six characters from the versus mode and a &amp;quot;clone fight&amp;quot; against the character they did not select. Beating the game leads to the ending and a password (A, B, L, R, X, Y, Start) that allows players to select the same character as their opponent in versus mode.</resource>

Player can fish in: Skywater Lake (Local Amateur), Clear Lake (Amateur), Murphy Lake (Pro) and Bluestone Lake (Super Bass), the goal of which is to catch a certain weight limit of bass before a certain time limit.

There are two screens, the boating screen where players navigate a lake using the D-Pad to navigate, the &amp;quot;A&amp;quot; button for acceleration and the &amp;quot;B&amp;quot; button for reverse.  The &amp;quot;Y&amp;quot; button is used to enter the fishing screen.  There is also a fish finder on the lower part of the screen that helps the player in locating a good place to fish.

When the player enters the &amp;quot;fishing screen&amp;quot;, they can use the &amp;quot;L &amp; R&amp;quot; shoulder buttons to increase the distance meter, the &amp;quot;X&amp;quot; button brings up the lure selection screen, the &amp;quot;B&amp;quot; button can bring an overhead view of the location the player currently has the lure set for and the &amp;quot;Y&amp;quot; button brings the player back to the &amp;quot;boat mode&amp;quot;.  To cast, the player presses the &amp;quot;A&amp;quot; button once to start the cast meter and a pressing it again when the meter is set at a certain limit to cast it.

While fishing, the player will have an overhead top-down mode of the lake, using the &amp;quot;A&amp;quot; button to reel in their lure and using the D-Pad to manipulate movement of the lure.  Fish can be seen through the water, outlined in a light color while bigger fish are seen stationary and cast in a dark shadow.  Once the player hooks the fish, a meter will show up at the bottom, showing the tension of the line, when it hits to the far right of the meter, the line will snap.  The line can also be manually cut by pressing the &amp;quot;A+B&amp;quot; buttons together.

There are eight different lures to choose from (Pencil Bait, Torpedo, Jitterbug, Frog, Crankbait, Spoon, Furry Sinker &amp; Plastic Worm) along with several different color variations to choose from and five fish to catch (Blue Gill, Rainbow Trout, Catfish, Northern Pike and the game's namesake, Bass).

There are also attributes the player can have, Technique and Strength, that can be upgraded by catching more bass and  progress can be kept through a password feature.</resource>

This game was an overhaul of the entire system of bombermans from before.  Again there are new levels and a new story but there are also a lot of new features.

Super Bomberman 3 adds in 5 player support using a multitap and the extra controller slot.  The &amp;quot;revenge&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;miso bomber&amp;quot; feature was introduced in this game.  That is when a player dies they can still throw bombs in from the sidelines in an attempt to swap places with a player that is still alive.  Many new powerups were added in this game including the Kangaroo which in addition to giving a player and extra hit allowed them to have some extra ablity including jumping, laying rows of bombs, and high speed running.

Players are also not limited to the traditional Bomberman.  There is a wide selection of different characters that the player can choose from.</resource>

Belmont has the classic Castlevania assortment of weapons (the famous whip, daggers, axes, fire bombs, boomerangs) at his disposal, and he gains strength and points by collecting various-sized hearts, coin purses, and pork chops. 

Like most Castlevania games, Super Castlevania IV is a 2D side-scrolling action game. However, it is 2D with more depth than ever before. Parallax scrolling and rotating chambers are some of the &amp;quot;Mode 7&amp;quot; effects made possible by the SNES hardware.</resource>

As usual, you must drive your way towards a criminal's vehicle, which is known to be involved in some crime, while avoiding passing cars to gain points. Your car also comes equipped with three turbos, which can be useful if you are way behind the vehicle.

But this time, cars aren't just the only things that you have to worry about. You will also encounter bikes that shoot or throw firebombs at you, as well as cars that go the wrong way. (If you crash into one of these, you'll be sent flying through the air.) Not to mention other obstacles such as barricades.

Furthermore, as well as the criminal's damage indicator, you also have your own. When you finally catch up with each criminal,  they are likely to shoot at you if you get too close to their vehicle, but you may encounter criminals who have different ways of attacking you. The fourth criminal, for example, launches a missile at you if you are further behind him. Once you are shot at and hit, your indicator decreases for every time you are hit, but this rule does not apply when you're hit by passing cars. When your indicator is empty or when you're out of time, the game ends.

When you complete each round, a statistics screen will appear, and you are awarded points based on the time remaining, how much damage you've done, and the number of nitros that are used. One of the options allow you to display the game's speedometer in either MPH or Km/h. The game also has a storyline, which can be viewed in between rounds.</resource>

The narrative of the game follows that of Super Chinese World 2, where extraterrestrial martial arts continue to be a threat to twin protagonists Jack and Ryu and their friends Poi and Lin-Lin.

In the adventure mode, Lin-Lin is captured by Kyonkyonshi, a jiang shi, and the two brothers are forced to rescue her. This mode punctuates story scenes with fights against CPU opponents, and also allows the player to acquire consumable items and use them where necessary.

The game also has a survival &amp;quot;Circuit&amp;quot; mode and the standard human vs. human Versus mode.</resource>

However the conference is disrupted when alien invaders capture all members of the peace conference and declare themselves rulers of the galaxy. To back up this claim, the invaders have assigned several champions as lieutenants. Hearing that things are once again in trouble, ninja warriors Ryu and Jack quickly enlist the help of the people of Futureland to build a spaceship and attack one of the champions. However strong their intentions, Ryu and Jack are unable to defeat this opponent and must land at nearby planet for repairs...

(In the fifth skill level, there is also a Flag Ship, and the game is lost if either one is destroyed.) Scenarios are laid on on a hexagonal grid, and each space has its own terrain type and can be occupied by one unit. You move your units around and attack enemy units in adjacent hexagons. There are also cities, airports, and shipyards, which you can occupy and use for your own purposes (ie. to repair a unit). Depending on the skill level or scenario you can also construct factories to produce additional units.

Rool has stolen Donkey Kong's banana stash, and Donkey Kong needs your help to get them back. In search of K. Rool, the Kremling horde impedes your progress. Kremlings, crocodile-like creatures, include Kritters (they succumb to a simple jump on the head), Krushas (they are virtually indestructible), and others. There are also other enemies that block your path, such as beavers, snakes, vultures. Leading them are dastardly bosses, including Very Gnawty, Necky, Bumble B, and Dumb Drum, and they all bar the way with their own special blend of villainy.

Donkey Kong is joined by Diddy Kong: these two primates differ significantly. For example, Donkey Kong is generally stronger; he can destroy most enemies with a single jump and can lift barrels straight over his head to throw them farther. On the other hand, Diddy is faster and not as strong as Donkey; he can run really fast and do cartwheels. Diddy carries barrels in front of him, creating a shield against frontal attacks.

The game is split into different worlds, which are split into different levels. Each level contains bonus areas, where one can collect bananas, medallions, and lives. At the end of each world is a boss, which is usually a larger version of a minor enemy.</resource>

It is a barebones budget game intended to cut to the chase, with a selection of opponents to choose from before moving straight into a four-person game. In comparison to many other straightforward mahjong games, Super Double Yakuman II has some lighthearted elements, with its silly CPU anime portraits and over-the-top victory celebrations.</resource>

The game is a traditional top-down racing game that emphasizes sim elements, such as selecting the car's various parts and ensuring that the rules of the race are followed. If the player causes too many infractions, or too much damage is caused to six vital instruments on the car, they will be forced out of the race.</resource>

    <resource id="4e7d7c5bb5de24b1a36243c8e399f78b231d7094" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Long before the WWE introduced the Divas wrestling matches, in Japan there was a more serious affair, where wrestling skill was more important than breast implants, and matches were &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; (as far as wrestling goes) instead of pillow-fighting or bra and panties fights.

In this game in the Fire Pro Series, the cast of the All Japan Women's Pro-Wrestling promotion are available, all fighting to win the Red belt, the highest prize of the federation. It's also possible to fight in single matches, tournaments, Battle Royal and Elimination matches. The usual array of options in CAW is present, being possible to create 16 new Wrestlers.

Gameplay, as usual is the series, is dramatically different than in most western games. Each wrestler has a bunch of moves, ranked from weak to strong. While it's possible to connect any of them from open situations, while grappling only when the opponent is already beaten the most powerful moves can be successfully used.

This is the first game ever created with contribution from Goichi Suda. Due to complaints about the game's difficulty, Human released &amp;quot;Super Fire Pro Wrestling 3 Easy Type&amp;quot;. In this version there is no edit mode but all of the hidden wrestlers are unlocked.

Characters based on wrestling stars such as WWF's Hulk Hogan and WCW's Rick Rude are featured in the game along with Japanese professional wrestlers like Masahiro Chono. Each wrestler is ranked based on their attacking ability, defensive ability, and their running speed. An &amp;quot;edit mode&amp;quot; allows customized wrestlers to be created based on their wrestling type, the color of their skin, and a unique set of customized ring attire. A certain amount of points also have to be spent on developing certain attacks (and their respective defense against these attacks from opposing wrestlers). Digitized voices from the wrestlers and cheers from the audience members are included. Two of the buttons on the Super Famicom controller are used for strong blows while another button is used strictly for low blows. Sprites in the game actually show wrestlers in different sizes to each other (depending on height and weight). A battle royale mode permits four wrestlers to face off against each other simultaneously. There are 56 different wrestlers to control; with eight playable wrestling legends. Referees are available and can be chosen by the player; each referee has his own level of strictness and essentially determine how long the match will last. It is possible to perform up to 300 different professional wrestling moves in the game.</resource>

While all fighters have fictional names, a lot of them are perfectly recognizable by their attire, stance and style. The CAW mode allows the player to create a wrestler from scratch, setting how they look (choosing face, size, clothing and setting colours) and fight, with several styles and stances available, as well as over 500 moves, each more suitable for certain styles and skills. To make them fight more realistically when controlled by the AI, the CAW mode also allows one to set move priorities.

Five game modes are available, including World Championship (single and tag), Battle Royale, 5-man Elimination Mode, League Battle and the One Night Dream Match. There are several referees available (each with their own quirks) and variant rules, from allowing fighting outside the ring without count-out (or disallowing it) to the disabling of disqualifications from illegal moves.</resource>

It was developed by Geo Factory (their second Super Famicom game, after Super Jinsei Game) and published by Naxat Soft. The player, as an avid fisherman in a green backwards cap, is invited to participate in a multi-stage fishing contest that takes place across Japan.

The game uses a third-person behind-the-angler perspective, and the player can select a spot in each of the game's fishing areas and pick which direction to cast their line. There are different lures and bait that the player can use which all perform differently and attract different fish.

The game was followed in 1997 with a Sega Saturn sequel: Top Anglers: Super Fishing Big Fight 2.</resource>

It focuses entirely on Serie A, the highest division in the Italian Football League, and is licensed by the Italian Football League and Associazione Italiana Calciatori to use the real team and player names for the eighteen sides of the 1994-95 season of Serie A. It was released on the same day as another Serie A soccer game developed by a Japanese studio: Shijou Saikyou League Serie A: Ace Striker from TNN.

The game was released alongside two alternate versions:

- The Extra Package version which included a special booklet with stats and data on all 396 players in the Serie A league.
- A promotional version sponsored by UCC Xaqua, a soft drink endorsed by the Italian Football League and the footballer Roberto Baggio that consumers could win by entering a postcard competition. This particular edition had a very limited distribution.

The game uses sprite-scaling for its presentation, displaying the pitch from an angled vertical perspective in which the far side of the pitch is always visible, though becomes smaller or larger the closer the player is to the opposing goal. It also includes the player name across the bottom of the screen for whoever has possession of the ball at the time, making it easier to track what certain players are doing.</resource>

It features eighteen teams from national leagues across the world, the majority of which are from European or South American countries. The logos and names of these teams are fictional but are reminiscent of or parodying various well-known teams from those same countries. This was a common copyright-avoidance tactic Human Entertainment utilized for their Fire Pro Wrestling games.

As with previous Super Famicom entries, the game uses a distinctive perspective that employs Mode 7 to present a Z-axis view of the pitch, with the player's goal is at the &amp;quot;bottom&amp;quot; of the screen and the opponent's goal is at the far end. The game has multiple modes, including exhibition matches and tournaments, and can support up to four players in a number of team configurations.</resource>

Super Soccer. Like its forebear, Super Formation Soccer II depicts the pitch from a low bird's eye angle, using the Super Famicom's Mode 7 to depict a depth of field.

The game uses national teams, though the player is free to create their own &amp;quot;All-Star&amp;quot; team by mixing and matching the soccer players in the game. They can select from an exhibition match, a penalty shoot-out mode or a tournament called the Human Cup.

Newly added to the second Super Formation Soccer is the inclusion of three and four player multiplayer, with the use of a multitap peripheral. There are pre-set options for one vs one, two vs one (the one can be human or CPU) and two vs two, rather than the now standard system of allowing each player to move their controller icon to either team.</resource>

Boy, you'd think that after being defeated four times prior that he would take a hint.  This time, you also get to face his five best soldiers, who will try to stop you in your tracks.  Bonk controls rather smoothly, and he is really fun to control.  To those of you that are not familiar with the series, Bonk is a caveman who attacks his enemies with his noggin; after jumping down, from below, while swimming, and while in the air.  He can even bounce off walls with his head, skip on the water like a stone if his head is facing down, climb certain walls with his teeth, scale up waterfalls, flip in the air (so long as the attack button is repeatedly being tapped), and so forth.  As is the case with the series, you start with a regular amount of health, but if you find a translucent heart icon, you'll increase your capacity.  What's neat is how collecting the food not only scores you some points but how it also replenishes a little bit of your health, too.  This time Bonk can also run if you hold down the A button, and the X button is used if you have a special ability on you.  If you find a power-up, whether it be piece of meat, or a different icon, then you will be given a power-up ability that will be taken out the moment you're hit once (damn).  Among the power-ups are the one where the fire will be spreading if Bonk hits his head on the ground (you know, the one where he looks freaky), one where Bonk turns into a bird and gains the ability to fly, one where Bonk becomes tiny and can make platforms made out of Japanese characters, and there is one where Bonk has the ability to double-jump as a girl.  Yes, Bonk becomes a girl if he eats the pink-colored meat.  I'm dead serious.</resource>

The game is divided into two main gameplay modes, Movement and Battle.  Movement has the player travel through the city using the D-pad and a map located on the bottom of the screen with the objective being to destroy certain objectives such as enemy humans and buildings as well as pick up power-ups.  There is an animation in the screen above the map that shows the results of their movements and attacks.

Battle mode kicks in when the player locates an enemy on the map, like Biollante or Mechagodzilla, and is taken to a side-scrolling cinematic-style battle where the player must use punches, tail whips and the famous fire breath to drain the energy of the opposing monster.  However, the Fighting Spirit system is present which is in a sense a morality meter where the player must pick the right attacks at the right time in order to connect certain attacks.  Choosing the wrong attacks or failing to connect with them will cause the meter to drop and make Godzilla more vulnerable to attack.</resource>

The game is played with a Go board and pieces, but the goal is to simply line up five pieces horizontally, vertically or diagonally. The game has a few modes, including a tournament mode in which the player takes on CPU opponents of increasing difficulty.

The last Gomoku Narabe Renju adaptation for a Nintendo console was also one of the earliest games released for the original Famicom. It was created by Nintendo themselves and is otherwise unrelated to Super Gomoku Narabe Renju.</resource>

The cart features both Shogi (Japanese chess) and gomoku (a tile game similar to Go in which the goal is to complete a line of five pieces). The game features a few options for both including the challenge level for the computer opponent and other parameters specific to either game.

The game was developed and published by Nichibutsu (a.k.a. Nihon Bussan) in late 1994. Like most simulations of Japanese board games it was never localized into English.</resource>

The game is an interesting and unique crossover between the 'puzzly' side of Tetris and the 'save all the rodents' side of Lemmings. The goal of the game is to guide a bald and fun looking creature, who also happens to be a treasure hunter called Gussun (and his friend Oyoyo in two players mode), to the level's exit. This character just keeps walking around and gets scared at the silliest things. While he aimlessly wanders around the playfield, Tetris like pieces fall from the top of the screen, and the player must rotate and position them in the scene. Once in place, these blocks can be used by Gussun to climb on to reach new areas, and eventually lead him through the exit door. Tons of other features are also packed with the game, such as bombs or little buddies who follow Gussun to the exit (collect 10 of them for an extra life!). Time is of course limited and water starts filling up the stage if players stay in one levels for too long. Additionally, traps and monsters soon appear and things get quickly tricky and will squeeze the juice out of the player's brain in no time. An intense two-player versus mode and a level editor are also available.</resource>

The game makes a few significant changes to the original Super Gussun Oyoyo. The most apparent of which is its new setting of a tropical island with an active volcano: many stages will start dropping fireballs the longer the player takes, which must be avoided at all costs. The game also features a new &amp;quot;Puzzle Mode&amp;quot; which plays similarly to those found in Tetris sequels: the player has a limited number of pre-determined pieces and must figure out how to use them to get their little bald friend to the end.</resource>

Nintendo themselves are known for being producers of hanafuda cards before they eventually moved to video games, and many hanafuda simulators were created for Nintendo platforms to homage their history.

Super Hanafuda was joined that year by Honke Hanafuda and Hanafuda Ou, both for the Super Famicom. The same developer/publisher team would go on to create Super Hanafuda 2 in October 1995.</resource>

It features much improved graphics over International Cricket and gameplay superior to all modern cricket games. However, Super International Cricket also suffered like its predecessor by missing official team and player licensing, has a one-track sound loop and one stadium. Eight teams are included: Sri Lanka, Australia, England, South Africa, New Zealand, India, Pakistan and the West Indies.</resource>

Pond has been armed with an Inspector Gadget-style stretch device, which he can use to view higher areas or claw onto ceilings so as to slide across them.

The gameplay takes place across worlds themed around particular types of toys, such as sporting goods, candy and aircraft. The levels scroll sideways, although a small amount of vertical movement is included. On each level Pond must collect 2 penguins and reach the exit, although there are usually multiple exits and lots of secret areas to explore. After completing each pair of two worlds (each of which has three sub levels), a boss must be faced.

Each character/portrait has their own voice - demonstrated with small clips whenever they call a play - and will make comments during and after each round.</resource>

Nichibutsu) in which the player bets on and sponsors motorboat racing. The game is structurally similar to the Super Famicom's many horseracing sims: races are automatically played out by the CPU and the player interaction is limited to the simulation elements. The player can also create their own races with carefully defined parameters, possibly to simulate real-world motorboat races that the player wishes to put money on.

The game followed the similarly-themed Jissen Kyoutei, published by Imagineer earlier the same month. It saw a sequel in 1996's Super Kyoutei 2.</resource>

Super Mahjong was followed by a few sequels: Super Mahjong 2: Honkaku 4Jin Uchi and Super Mahjong 3.

Opponents
The twelve opponents each represent a country and resemble famous leaders from each nation. They include Abraham Lincoln (USA), Adolf Hitler (Germany), Mikhail Gorbachev (Russia), Margaret Thatcher (UK), Tutenkhamun (Egypt), Genghis Khan (Mongolia), and Mahatma Gandhi (India).</resource>

There was one more Super Mahjong game for the Super Famicom: Super Mahjong 3. Like most mahjong games, Super Mahjong 2 was never released outside of Japan.</resource>

The Taikai games feature many odd characters as CPU opponents, often taken from Koei's strategic simulation games. For instance, Napoleon and Nobunaga Oda are selectable CPU opponents.</resource>

    <resource id="d524d982e7edd568b18a57d23e7648fd91075cb1" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Put quite simply, this is the amalgamation of the previously released Super Mario All-Stars compilation with Super Mario World added. While games already in  the All-Stars bundle have major graphical and audio improvements, the only change made to Super Mario World is a slight tweak of Luigi's graphic sprites, making him slightly thinner and taller (rather than being the same height and stature of Mario) which does not affect gameplay.

Altogether the following games are included:

1. Super Mario Bros.
2. Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels
3. Super Mario Bros. 2
4. Super Mario Bros. 3
5. Super Mario World

Super Mario All-Stars + Super Mario World could only be found in &amp;quot;Mario Set&amp;quot; bundled edition of the Super Nintendo console.</resource>

    <resource id="426fcebf108d00742060b39555ad255e72966daa" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Super Mario RPG is a console RPG starring none other than Nintendo's popular character Mario. This game starts off like almost every other Mario game, with Bowser kidnapping Princess Toadstool. However, when Mario goes to Bowser's Keep to save her, a giant sword made by the evil Smithy crashes into the castle and sends Mario, the Princess, and Bowser flying to separate parts of the world.

The game plays much like a traditional RPG: Mario and the members of his party gain experience points by defeating enemies. These experience points can increase the team's maximum number of hit points and flower points (magic points). The battles are also turn-based, but this time there are timed attacks and defenses. Timed attacks allow you to inflict more harm than normal to an enemy. Timed defenses, on the other hand, allow an enemy to inflict less harm than normal. You are only allowed to have three out of five team members on your party at a time. Mario is always in your party, regardless. Your team members can also purchase more weapons and abilities, along with better armor.

To aid him in his quest, Mario must use the flying ability of the feather to get him to places hard to reach. But what's even more important is his new friend, the dinosaur Yoshi, who Mario can ride through each level and eat the enemies.

Over 90 levels are on offer, with plenty of Bowser's evil koopas and new characters around each level. Apart from saving Peach, you can also save some of Yoshi's friends, other dinosaurs that each have a special attack. Each level also contains a set of extra items to collect, including dinosaur coins, and break the tape at the end of each level to collect stars, that allow you to open up the bonus games.</resource>

Mario was one of two twin brothers whom the evil Magikoopa Kamek tried to kidnap. Kamek kidnapped one of the brothers, but the second, Mario, fell down on Yoshi's island, where Yoshis live. The Yoshis decided to carry baby Mario and to bring him to his parents. But Kamek has sent troops and hordes of monsters to stop the Yoshis and to kidnap Mario.

In the game, players control the differently colored Yoshis most of the time. Mario is a helpless baby unless a star that makes him invincible is collected. As a Yoshi, players can swallow enemies to make eggs; these eggs are used for attacking other enemies and activating switches. Yoshi can do a flutter jump to clear large gaps that a regular jump can't. Players can also pound the ground for attacks and also flipping certain switches. Additionally, Yoshis can transform into vehicles, such as a helicopter, submarine, or a train. If Mario is dismounted from a Yoshi, a countdown will start, and Yoshi must catch the baby before Kamek's servants kidnap it. When Mario is invincible, he doesn't ride on Yoshi and is immune to attack. While invincible, Mario can run up certain walls.

Even Darth Vader sounds German.). Now he's been split into his 4 component parts, represented by liquid, gas, a hard ball and a bouncy ball, and he must get through 24 levels (36 on the special A1200 version - mirroring the game's plot-line of improved technology causing more problems for Morris) to retrieve the parts of the machine so it can be rebuilt to bring him back to life.

The gameplay is vaguely influenced by Lemmings, as the levels are populated by lots of points which can't be crossed in all forms - walls, fires, gaps, thornbushes and suchlike. You get a set number of transformations on each level, although extra ones can be picked up at times, and there are heaters and freezers dotted around which cause transformations in some states. All this is done against a time limit. Like Lemmings 2, you can take on the next level in each of the worlds at any time, so you have to be stuck 4 times before you can't progress.</resource>

The game uses the standard top-down perspective for golf games from this era.

It is unusual for the inclusion of Naxat's Dorabocchan (&amp;quot;Little Dorabo&amp;quot;) character, who had appeared in two games at this point: 1990's Makai Prince Dorabocchan for the PC Engine and 1993's Chou Makai Taisen: Dorabocchan for SNES, best known as The Twisted Tales of Spike McFang in the US. Dorabocchan/Spike's inherent magical talent allows him to beneficially manipulate his game, which appears in the form of magical cards he can play before taking a swing. The player can also choose to play as five other characters from the franchise, as well as a choice of six caddies.</resource>

    <resource id="1f22bdf29738d01fa7394efd9a2b0774748159ee" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">A spin-off of the successful action puzzle series Puyo Puyo with a twist. Whereas the main Puyo Puyo games are aimed at defeating AI or human controlled opponents in puzzle duels (where each player has his own play area in which color-coded &amp;quot;puyos&amp;quot; fall and must clear them out faster than his opponent). Nazo Puyo instead challenges the player with different single-player scenarios in which a specific objective must be completed (such as clearing only the red Puyos, or performing a specific sequence of combos, etc.).

The game uses the mold of a top-down RPG in which you control the young magician Arle as she explores towns and dungeons in her search for adventure. Each quest involves finding an NPC who will trigger one of the aforementioned scenarios and rewards Arle with experience points and unique items that increase her stats.

You play as the young magician Arle as she sets out looking for adventure all over the land, chatting with NPCs and exploring the game world via a standard top-down RPG interface. Quests involve careful exploration and solving Nazo Puyo challenges which involve specific scenarios of puzzle-based gameplay which the player must solve under a specific timeframe. These sequences give the player a play area in which color-coded &amp;quot;puyos&amp;quot; are pre-arranged in different patterns, and the player must position and arrange the ones that start to fall in order to fullfil the objective at hand (clear only a certain row or color of puyos, reach a certain number of combos, etc.). Additionally, running into specific monsters can trigger standard Puyo Puyo duels, in which both players have their own play areas and the objective is to clear the screen faster than the opponent.

The player can select between two, three and four player modes: four is the usual Mahjong standard, but various different rulesets are available to allow for fewer players.

Like most Mahjong games, Super Nichibutsu Mahjong was only released in Japan. The game was eventually followed up with three sequels.</resource>

It began broadcasting an image of peace. Soon Emperor Chin was holding a peace conference with the space ship's leader, Rub-A-Doc. Rub-A-Doc visited with some of the other places in the world before departing to the heavens and leaving the world. All seemed peaceful however there seems to be trouble starting up, strange monsters have been seen throughout Chinaland. Could the increase in monsters be somehow related to the recent visit from Rub-A-Doc? The ninja masters of Mount Edin, Jack and Ryu are sent to investigate...

Super Ninja Boy is an action RPG for one or two players. In a two player game, each player controls either Jack or Ryu. In a one player game, only Jack appears.A second player may join at any time by visiting a convenience store.

As mentioned, this game is an RPG and contains familiar RPG elements such as equipping differing kinds of weapons, equipment and gaining levels. The Ninja Boys are treated as a single entity and so these statistics are shared between Jack and Ryu with equal values. Battles with the enemy, either through random encounters or visible on the map is where the action starts. The characters enter a side-scrolling 'battle mode' where they may jump, fight, use their special techniques, items and spells... as well as activate various 'bonuses' on the battlefield by breaking open the bonus boxes. A battle is over and experience points awarded when a pre-determined number of enemies are defeated or the Ninja Boys are defeated.

When bosses are encountered, the gameplay changes to a turn-based system. Each turn, commands are given to Jack &amp; Ryu, which include usage of special items and skills accuired during the game, who then perform actions based on those commands. The enemy's turn takes place the same way. The battle ends when one side of the conflict runs out of hitpoints.</resource>

It is a graphically updated version of UPL's Ninja-kun Arcade games from the 1980s, which Jaleco had previously adapted for consoles (as well as creating their own spin-offs, named Ninja Jajamaru-kun).

As well as featuring 16-bit graphics the game now also features a story mode, bosses, an upgradable health gauge (the Arcade game only allowed Ninja-kun to take a single hit) and multiple weapon types. Ninja-kun can also create a powerful one-off magic blast by collecting the souls of dead enemies as they float off the screen. The game also includes a two-player cooperative mode.

Super Ninja-kun is not to be confused with Super Ninja Boy, another ninja-themed action game for the SNES.</resource>

Fame, glory and bikini clad women await your victories and the taste of dirt awaits if you fail. Let a computer car beat you and you lose one of your 3 credits.

Successful races bring more money, which can be used to soup up their machine. Boosts to top speed, grip and acceleration can be purchased, and your nitro boost must be kept topped up. If you are desperate for upgrades, you can buy into your spare credits

Only your off-road driving abilities will be enough to pull you to first place in these races. Play alone or with up to 3 other players (depending on the version)  in this conversion of a classic arcade game.

Unlike its predecessor which uses an isometric top-down view of a single-screen track, this arcade racing game is made specifically for the SNES and uses its Mode 7 hardware for a 3D racing experience with a 3rd person perspective.

The game has three different tournaments, the Mexico 250, Ensenada 500 and Baja 1000. Instead of having to drive many consecutive rounds on a small circuit the circuits are big and more akin to rally racing with a finish at a different location than the start. The game is still held with many opponents as well as non participating traffic and wildlife that can hinder the player or be ruthlessly run over. Along the bumpy off-road tracks the player can collect bags of money, just like in its predecessor. Money can be spend on improvements of various of the car's parts, such as: brakes, tires, shocks, lights, engine and nitros.

It is the second of four games made exclusively for the Super Famicom, all of which have the &amp;quot;Super&amp;quot; prefix.

The five Super Power League games were all licensed by Fuji TV, using their commentators, but Super Power League 2 is the exception: instead, it used the sports commentators of TBS (Tokyo Broadcasting System).

Hudson would use elements of Super Power League 2 as the basis for The Sporting News: Baseball.</resource>

It features the standard gameplay modes: A single Open game, a multi-game Pennant mode, an All-Stars mode with special teams, a Home Run Derby mode (named &amp;quot;Race&amp;quot;), and an opportunity to watch a match between two CPU teams.</resource>

Super Professional Baseball II uses the same angled viewpoint as its predecessor while batting/pitching, to ensure both the batter and pitcher are clearly visible. Small animations play whenever a batter reaches a base just as the ball flies in, allowing the player to see clearly whether or not the batter is actually &amp;quot;safe&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;out&amp;quot;.</resource>

He has been expelled from Putty Moon by Dazzledaze the wizard and his assistant Dweezil the Cat. Your job is to lead the character round the platform levels making use of his special abilities to rescue and destroy.

When moving, Putty has a natural bounce, and his eyes are loosely attached, moving after his body after falls (as a visual effect). He has many moves available - he can stretch himself to traverse larger gaps between (or move up/down) platforms, unleash a long-range punch, explode (which works like a smart bomb, clearing the screen of enemies) or flatten himself into a puddle on the floor (to absorb anything that walks over him).

Baseball is the first appearance of the R.B.I. series on the Super Nintendo.  It features 700 major MLBPA players and has all 28 teams along with the complete 1994 roster, but doesn't feature an MLB license, instead the teams nicknames are omitted and team colors are altered.

There are six modes to choose from: Exhibition, Home Run Derby, Defense Practice, Playoffs, League, that has the player compete against each team in the game in succession and Game Breaker which lets the player choose from 17 scenarios to win the game under certain conditions.  They can also choose different Division Champion line-ups that range from 1989-1993 or All-Star Lineups from 1989-1994.

The graphics of the game are presented in a cartoonish-way and the stadiums are &amp;quot;authentic&amp;quot;, but altered to distinguish themselves from the actual MLB stadiums.  The game doesn't feature a battery back-up like many other baseball games, but Series championships can be saved using passwords.  Jack Buck also lends his voice talent to the game calling play-by-play commentary.</resource>

Rounds won by the player lead to undressing animations; however, while the computer version has explicit nudity, console versions are censored. All the versions have the same opponents, cutscenes, and gameplay rules. The computer version adds a versus mode in which girls can compete against each other, while the Super Famicom (SNES) version has a so-called &amp;quot;puzzle mode&amp;quot;, which reveals parts of a puzzle as the player wins mahjong rounds.</resource>

Instead of only three female opponents the game has nine, including characters from previous entries in the series. Players can choose between a tournament and a team mode, in which three teams made of three girls each compete against each other.

Also included is an extensive mini-game mode: each of the nine girls offers her own mini-game. These games are fairly simple, usually containing only one screen, and range from a jigsaw puzzle to cake-baking and balancing a motorcycle on a log.</resource>

Aside from Super Robot Wars EX, the plotline wasn't given much attention before; the main focus was on Bian Zoldark's Divine Crusaders (Super Robot Wars 2) and later the threat of the Inspectors (Super Robot Wars 3) and Guests (Super Robot Wars 4).

Part 1 of the game elaborates on the background of Masaki Andou, explaining how Masaki became the pilot of the Cybuster and how he came to hate Shu Shirakawa. This part ends with Shu escaping to the surface and Masaki chasing after him, setting up the latter's introduction into SRW2. Part 2 takes place after the end of the war with the Guests (SRW4), and follows Masaki's and Shu's battles in La Gias.

This game was released before SRW4 was retconned in favor of Super Robot Wars F and F Final; however, the changes don't affect the Masou Kishin plot.</resource>

They are even piloted by robots with one mission: to destroy. Military and intelligence officials of major countries have detected them, but they are afraid that they will be unable to prepare against an assault by this underground race. Their plan is to send you in to infiltrate their base and destroy them before they have a chance to unleash the war upon the rest of the world. You can choose to control either the Helicoptor or the Jeep, which have different advantages -- for instance, the Helicoptor is not obstructed by obstacles but the Jeep can fire in any direction. There are nine weapons (five permanent, four short-lasting specials) you can pick up along the way to help you destroy the enemy.

Even though the game doesn't carry an NBA license, 27 of the teams are based on the cities of their real professional counterparts of that era. The other team is an all star team.

The game has an exhibition and playoff mode. Exhibition is the usual team vs team game, while the playoff mode has 8 teams competing to win the championship. Players can choose to turn fouls on or off and also choose how many minutes each quarter will be.

The game features a vertical basketball court, with only half of the court shown at any one time. When a player takes the ball from one side of the court to the other, the screen rotates and then the other half of the court is shown.

The world's most popular television show is Smash T.V., an ultra-violent contest between two armed-to-the-teeth combatants, set loose in a series of deadly arenas that are filled to bursting with hordes of mindless beasts and killer robots. The aim of the game is to blast everything in sight and try to grab more cash and prizes than the other guy. Toaster ovens, VCRs, fancy cars and luxury holidays are there for the taking... for anyone who can survive long enough to enjoy them.

Smash T.V. is an insane shoot-em-up from the brain of Eugene Jarvis, creator of Robotron: 2084. It retains that game's frantic style of play and two-joystick control method, but adds plenty of gore, violence, a hint of satire and that all-important two player mode.

Thinking Rabbit created the original game in 1982 on home computers, and Super Sokoban is the first Super Famicom game to follow the same blueprint.

The intro establishes that the eponymous Sokoban, or warehouse worker, must perform enough box-pushing puzzles to earn enough cash for a flashy new car so that he might finally impress the girl of his dreams.

An added wrinkle is that each stage has a fixed move limit, and so the player must not only push the boxes in the right order but do so with maximum efficiency. The game was not released outside of Japan.</resource>

The player initially controls the movie's main hero, Luke Skywalker, but two more controllable characters join later: the careless captain Han Solo and his Wookie side-kick, Chewbacca. The game generally follows the movie plot, allowing the player to experience some of the most important sequences, such as the search for Obi-Wan Kenobi, rescuing princess Leia, and the final confrontation against Death Star and its TIE Fighters, led by the mysterious Darth Vader.

Most of the game levels follow traditional platform gameplay style. As Luke, Han, or Chewbacca, the player makes his way through the linear levels, fighting enemies, jumping over obstacles, and collecting power-ups. The power-ups include standard health-restoring items, upgrades for the blaster gun , as well as special items that can be used for massive destruction of the enemies.</resource>

Gameplay consists of standard platform action spiced up with some slightly different (gameplay-wise) sequences. Race to Jabba the Hutt's palace in a speeder, fight your way through Jabba the Hutt's minions before killing Jabba himself, control speeder bikes and the Millennium Falcon, and much more.

    <resource id="4b9134d38a4aa95dd5847c48a1bef1a5b0d68606" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">The sequel to  Super Star Wars is, as the name implies, based on Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back, the second of the original  Star Wars movie trilogy. The game features familiar locations and events from the film, such as the ice planet Hoth, the search for Yoda on the jungle planet Dagobah, and the fight against Darth Vader. Several locations are expanded, adding places and boss enemies that did not exist in the movie, and certain key events in the story are omitted or changed. 

As in the previous game, the player is able to control three characters: Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, and Chewbacca. Unlike the first, each character has been given a distinct special move. Chewie spins a path of destruction through enemies, Han has grenades and a powerful slide, and Luke can switch to his lightsaber and block oncoming fire. Gameplay is very similar to the first game, mostly focusing on platforming elements. As before, there are Mode-7 vehicle levels, during which the player is able to pilot a snowspeeder against encroaching Imperial walkers, pilot the Millennium Falcon through the asteroid field, and break through Cloud City's defenses in Luke's X-Wing fighter. 

The game's other major addition is the inclusion of a suite of Force powers for Luke. They are learned by collecting hidden orbs on the Dagobah level, and add a second special bar that depletes with each usage of a Force power. Power-ups include health items, weapon upgrades, screen-clearing detonators, and orbs that restore Luke's Force power. Passwords have also been added, and are given upon completion of each of the game's 25 stages.

The player controls their fighter as the scene unfolds around them, as enemies of air, land, and sea continuously enter the screen in wave after wave of assault. The player(s) begins with a set number of lives, a number which can be added to with good play. Run out, and your mission is over - there are no saves!

Before each level, the player chooses one special weapon that can be utilized via an often-refilled meter, in addition to their normal guns. But choose wisely, you can only use one special weapon per round, and once used, it will be unavailable to you in later rounds! Play solo or with a human wingman.

(&amp;quot;Super Iron Ball Fight!&amp;quot;) is a maze action game featuring characters from the Compati Hero Series, which combines the worlds of Ultraman, SD Gundam, Kamen Rider and the original character Fighter Roar. Rather than relying on explosives, as is the case in the structurally similar Bomberman series, each character has a ball and chain which allows them to damage opponents and destroy blocks. They can acquire bonuses that increases the size of the ball, which causes it to do more damage, and the length of the chain, which increases its range.

The game features a single-player mode where the player takes one of the four protagonists through a series of maze stages that can be attempted in any order, each of which concludes with a boss fight. It also features a multiplayer mode where up to four players can compete for supremacy across a number of stages. Many enemies in the single-player mode use other weapons, like guns, missiles and flamethrowers.</resource>

As the title would suggest, the game features both standard Tetris as well as another similar game called Bombliss. Tetris offers three game modes: standard marathon (A-type), start with garbage (B-type), and rising garbage (C-type). There is also a two-player versus mode where clearing rows sends garbage to the other player.

Bombliss is slightly different from normal Tetris. Arranged on the board and in some dropped pieces are bomb squares. Completing a row does not clear the blocks in the row, but will trigger any bombs in the row which will destroy blocks. Different sizes of bombs will generate larger explosions. Bombliss is offered in standard marathon mode, a puzzle mode where a set board must be cleared using set piece drops, and a 2-player versus mode.</resource>

However, despite what the title may suggest, contained within are actually four different versions of Tetris: Tetris Classic, Familiss, Sparkliss, and Magicaliss. Tetris Classic, of course, is the basic version of the game, which comes with an endless mode and a 25-line &amp;quot;standard&amp;quot; mode. Familiss, as the name might suggest, is a family mode for up to four players simultaneously. Sparkliss, meanwhile, is very similar to Bombliss from Super Tetris 2, only with a medieval fantasy theme and different explosion patterns. Sparkliss includes both a stage mode and a puzzle mode.

The most unique mode is Magicaliss, which has never shown up on any other version of Tetris. In Magicaliss, pieces come in three basic colors, and by rotating the piece, the player can choose between them. Creating a line entirely out of one color will clear all blocks on the screen of that color. There are also grey pieces, which can only be cleared by creating a line made entirely from one color, which will cause all grey blocks on screen to become that color. There are also rare rainbow pieces which will act as any color. Besides these additions, the game itself is basic Tetris.

Tetris Classic, Sparkliss, and Magicaliss can also be played in a two-player battle mode, besides the four-player Familiss mode.</resource>

It is the first game in their Trump Collection series, which would later make its way onto various other systems. The series also saw one other game for the Super Famicom: Super Trump Collection 2.

The card games include Poker, Blackjack, Crazy Eights, Shichi Narabe (Sevens) and a Memory Match game, as well as two others.

Poker and Blackjack are both presented as their &amp;quot;video&amp;quot; incarnations often seen in casinos, and the player can bet a configurable amount of money on the result before starting. If they win a payout, they have the option of playing a double-or-nothing mini-game to increase their winnings (or potentially lose them). For Poker, the double-or-nothing game involves betting high or low on the next card, while Blackjack has the player guess red or black for the next card.</resource>

The game presents each scenario with an on-screen counter and the player needs to figure out how to use the pieces they have available to checkmate their opponent in the number of moves indicated on the counter.

The game was the first one to be published by Japanese company Bottom Up (Super Tsumeshogi 1000's developer is presently unknown). They would go on to publish many more games up until 2000, a lot of which are based on card and table-top games.</resource>

Similar to it's predecessors, Super Turican features large levels that are crammed with secrets and can be explored freely and in any direction. To get rid of the numerous enemies, Turrican can use three upgradeable shots: A spreadshot, a powerful laser and a rebound that bounces off of walls. Additionally, there is a Freeze-Beam that can be used to temporarily freeze enemies. It is fully rotatable, and therefor also a great help in discovering secret capsules. These capsules contain powerups and can often be used to reach secret areas. Last but not least, Turrican has the ability to transform into an energy wheel (as long as he has enough special energy), which enables him to lay mines and even makes him invincible.</resource>

This requires the player to jump and shoot his way through large levels filled with lots of enemies. To get rid of all the enemies, several different weapons can be used, most of which are already familiar to players from previous episodes: a Laser, a Spread-shot, and a(improved) Rebound. There is also the option to go into &amp;quot;wheel-mode&amp;quot; for a limited time to become invincible, lay mines and shoot rockets. The Flamethrower is new to the series as well as the Rope, which can be used to climb walls, cling to platforms or pick up out-of-reach items. Much like in side-scrolling shooters, you can now pick up homing missiles as secondary weapons. The biggest difference to previous Turrican-games however, is the fact that in Super Turrican 2 almost half of the levels are strictly linear and don't feature any large secret areas.</resource>

The player has a number of customization options for the number of players, special rules and other features. The game also has a bright cartoony style and a number of anime portraits for the player(s) to use.

As with the original card game, the goal is to be the first to play all the cards in the player character's hand. Each player can only play a card if it has the same number or color as the current card on the discard deck, otherwise they need to collect a new card. There are a number of exceptions, such as the Wild Card that can change the color in play. Other cards can put the player's opponents in dire straits, forcing them to add more cards to their deck and reversing the turn order.

The game was released exclusively in Japan for the Super Famicom by Tomy Corporation. Tomy licensed the Uno brand from rival toy giant Mattel.</resource>

He was entrusted with a magical ring that granted him great powers. But he was too weak to control the power of the ring, and became possessed by it. The mad prince was sealed into a crystal, but many years later managed to break out, planning to wreak havoc on the Dream World and to conquer it! Yuko, the heroine of the three previous Valis games, is no longer a sacred Valis warrior - she has become a goddess. Lena, a young girl who wants to become a Valis warrior, is the new main character, who must prove to Yuko she is worthy to wield the sword of Valis, that will eventually stop the evil plans of Gallagher.

Like the previous games in the series, this is an action platform game. You can fight enemies with melee weapons or use magic. In order to cast magic spells, you must gather special items while fighting off regular enemies. At the end of a level, a boss enemy battle awaits you. The game features cut scenes with animé-style graphics to advance the story.

This game also introduces two new features: the ability to adjust difficulty, and passwords to resume progress, both of which would become staples in the series.</resource>

The game actually follows immediately after the third and final Famicom entry, Wagyan Land 3, and continues the story from where it left off.

As with earlier games in the series, the goal is to get Wagyan to the end of each level, occasionally stopping to take part in mini-games such as shiritori (a Japanese word game) and an image puzzle game where the player has to decipher a heavily pixelated image and name the character in the picture.

Super Wagyan Land 2 was followed by Wagyan Paradise on the Super Famicom the following year.</resource>

Far off in the Horsehead Nebula, a group of shapeshifting aliens known as World Watchers assign planets for their Watchers to protect.  A purple alien, Widget, is an apprentice assigned with the job of protecting Earth.  Along for the ride is his intelligent sidekick, Mega Brain.

Super Widget is a platform game for the Super Nintendo, based on the cartoon show, Widget.  It shares some similarities to the game Felix the Cat in how the main character upgrades their weapon as they collect more power-ups.

Widget navigates through various worlds as he travels to Earth, picking up 'W' coins - 100 earns him an extra life.  There are also special power ups in different categories - these allow Widget to transform into a variety of different creatures, each with their own different ranged attack.  As the player collects more power-ups of the same type (up to three), they change into more powerful creatures.  If the player gets hit while transformed, they change back to the previous creature.  If they get hit while as normal Widget, they lose a life.

At the end of each world is a boss character.  These are larger enemies that require learning their basic pattern, avoiding their attacks, and then firing back with your own.  After defeating the boss, the player is graded based on how long it took to complete the level and their combat skills.  They are then awarded 'Watcher Experience' based on these grades.</resource>

There, the player takes the role of a woman wrestling group manager, picks a team and schedules practices, fights, entertainment and helps his cute wrestlers to elevate their professional careers. 

The other modes are more oriented towards actual fighting, and gets the player to pick female wrestlers and organize versus wrestling matches. However, Super Wrestle Angels is based around a popular Japanese wrestling card game, and because of this, all the matches are round based and opponents pick-up cards to decide of their next move.</resource>

The game features a story mode, which has a plot that borrows from elements of the anime, or a free mode in which the player can choose any of twelve characters from the show to play as (and against).

The game was followed by a sequel later the same year: Super Zugan 2: Tsukanpo Fighter.</resource>

The game is based on the Super Zugan anime, about the student Hideyoshi Toyotomi and his severe misfortune whenever he is coerced into playing high-stakes mahjong with his three delinquent colleagues. The one light in his life, his buxom girlfriend Akina, is a lot more intelligent (and lucky) and tries desperately throughout the series to convince him to stop. It is the follow-up to Super Zugan: Hakotenjou kara no Shoutai, which was released earlier the same year.

Super Zugan 2: Tsukanpo Fighter allows the player to construct a four-person game out of one of the many characters from the anime and a setting of their choice. The game is distinctive for showing the opponents sitting around the table, remarking on bad plays and showing various emotions depending on how well they're doing.</resource>

The game switches between a top-down mode, which features a protagonist (male or female) walking around interacting with pachinko machines and NPCs, and the various pachinko machines the protagonist visits to win money.

The game features over 30 different pachinko machines, all of which require a slightly different approach and can be collected back at the protagonist's home.</resource>

    <resource id="bfc8375f1ef1ca22a23e7121f58f535e70f05eb6" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Sutte Hakkun is a puzzle action game in the shape of a platformer. The playing character is an abundant-beaked bird resembling a penguin, named Hakkun, that is able to walk and jump but not to fly. The Rainbow of Happiness shined in the sky above Peaceful Islands: one day it broke apart and now Hakkun has to track down, collect, and put together all rainbow crystals to relive it. The gameplay hinges upon two elements: blocks and potions, the latter of several colours. Hakku makes its way through levels by changing the position of blocks â€” that will be done by swallowing them to release them on an other place then â€” and sucking potions â€” that are to be injected to blocks by the beak, endowing them with new properties consequential to the colour of the fluid â€” from jars. A level is cleared when the rainbow shards in it are collected. Neither a time limit nor enemy characters are there impeding Hakkun's way. Equally distinctive is the score system: a set number of points is given at the beginning of each level, and a decrease happens with any move made, thus rewarding the player for completing levels with as little moves as possible.

Before reaching the format of a common Super Famicom cartridge, the game was released for and downloadable by the console's add-on Satellaview in four versions. Given data size limitations, only one of the four of those, released for use with the Nintendo Power cartridge, could include all the levels designed by game creators: that is the one released as a Super Famicom standard cartridge later, and on Wii's Virtual console eventually.</resource>

    <resource id="7e1612c0fd91fbc8a570d54e21eacf18558bc64a" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">In the future, the world is controlled by a handful of global corporations (syndicates).  You are the Marketing director (hit man) for one of these companies.  It is your job to take control away from the competitors.  The job is not one of diplomacy, but one of brute force and physical control.  Advance your way to the top of the corporation by successfully completing your missions and managing the money you make from your territories.

The gameplay is visually reminiscent of X-Com, with an angled top-down perspective, but it is real time rather than turn based. You have missions ranging from infiltrate and capture, to seek and destroy. In each of these you direct a team of four agents as they move through the world shooting at anything that gets in their way.

You can upgrade and modify your agents, as well as equip them with tools you have researched or liberated from opposing syndicates.  As you complete missions, you gain more funds to use for purchasing agents or researching upgrades and equipment.</resource>

    <resource id="be34b6252d02dd8bfa16962535b73cf84da1cf08" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Syvalion is a Taito shoot 'em up that bucks trends by removing the forced scrolling and allowing the player to move in any direction at any pace they wish. The protagonist is a golden metallic dragon with several trailing segments that can breathe fire in eight directions to destroy enemies - the trailing segments make it vulnerable, so the player needs to keep moving to stay out of harm.

The game was originally released in Arcades in 1988. It was later ported to the Sharp X68000 in 1990 and the SNES in Japan and Europe in 1992/93 - an American SNES version was planned but cancelled. In 2006, Syvalion was eventually re-released for the PlayStation 2 as a part of Taito Legends 2, which made it available to US audiences for the first time.

Darius Burst, from Taito's acclaimed Darius series, features a boss will multiple forms. One of the forms greatly resembles the metal dragon of this game. The game was designed by Fukio Mitsuji, creator of Bubble Bobble.</resource>

    <resource id="f10c5a04031d59d329f573f0182e862fe0364fa0" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">As the title states, this is the home conversion of the arcade rail-shooter based on the film Terminator 2: Judgement Day. Up to two players shoot through future and present levels as robotic killers reprogrammed to serve the human resistance. 

Both players wield a machine gun with infinite ammo that lowers its firing rate (overheats) as it is continuously fired. A secondary weapon (missile launchers in the future, shotguns in the present) has limited ammo but deals heavy damage. Powerups inside the game world include secondary weapon ammo and coolant for the machine guns, and are shot to be collected.

T2: The Arcade Game features seven levels based on specific scenes or general concepts in the film. The first four levels act as a prelude, as the player guns down waves of metal Terminators across a post-apocalyptic Battlefield, a besieged Human Hideout, and through the security checkpoints of the enemy supercomputer SkyNet. After destroying the computer, players travel back in time to protect John and Sarah Connor, while also destroying every scrap of SkyNet research at the headquarters of its manufacturer. From there, players must fend off the indestructible T-1000 until the final showdown in the Steel Mill.

Assets from the movie are used when possible, such as voice clips from Arnold Schwarzenegger, and close-up digital stills of Robert Patrick for the final battle against the T-1000. The Genesis and SNES versions also support lightguns (the Menacer and Super Scope, respectively).

In the Championship mode, players choose from 1 of the 8 available boxers, and then compete against the other 7 boxers on the road to try becoming the World Champ. Players go toe to toe with their opponents in the boxing ring in 3 minute rounds. The boxers can throw hooks and jabs at each other with the sole intention to knock their opponent down to the canvas by draining all their energy by landing those punches. Each punch thrown costs the boxer some stamina which is indicated by boxing glove icons. If all the boxers stamina is drained, they can no longer throw punches for a little while until they gain some of their stamina back. After each fight is over, players go to the gym to train in various different exercises like skipping rope and bench pressing weights. These exercises increase the players boxer in various areas like speed and power.

Options include setting the number of rounds (from 1 to 10) and setting the difficulty level (novice, advanced, and expert).</resource>

Like many other fishing games, the player can choose from a variety of lures and search for a fishing spot through a top-down view utilizing a fish finder.  Once the player finds a suitable spot, they then can cast their lure and attempt to catch as many fish as possible, but also avoid snagging their lines or make them to tight and snap from the tension.

Players must also contend with changing weather conditions that can either help or hinder their time out on the lake and fish will react true to their real-life counterparts.  It also features a license from TNN (The Nashville Network).

Like Zico Soccer, the gameplay is more reminiscent of a strategy game in real time. It takes place before players' eyes so the action (which is represented by a small window at the top of the screen) can't be interrupted.

Each of the 16 national teams have 16 players with different skills (ranging from A to E). During a match, the player gives directions such as force at the center, play on the wings, back in defense, take a long or short pass. Depending on what the player chooses, it is possible to apply the command to a particular player, the player in possession of the ball, a part of the team (defense, midfield, attack) or the whole team. Everything is done relatively simply with combinations of buttons.

There are no headers, bicycle kicks or other fancy movements, scoring goals is only possible by kicking the ball. A replay is played every time a fault is committed (which happen quite often), a shot off target is made, or a goal is scored.</resource>

The goal of the game is to travel down the road, collecting Kiwi's before the timer runs out, avoiding obstacles along the way.  The Kiwi's will get harder to catch as the game goes on, jumping over Taz and actually outrunning him at times.

Some obstacles Taz faces are trees, telephone poles, tour buses, even pterodactyls who will bring Taz back at the beginning of the level, but also have to avoid characters such as Axl &amp; Bull, a pair of gators who try to capture Taz for the zoo, The She-Devil who is in love with Taz and if the player is caught by her, the game is instantly over and Wendal T. Wolf, who will jump on Taz's back and cover the screen with his hands making it hard to see.

You can avoid some obstacles by using Taz's tornado spin, but using the spin will cause Taz's health meter to drop, but it can be refilled by eating Kiwi's along with blue and red birds, bushrats and items thrown to Taz by Didgeri Dingo, but beware, he can also throw obstacles at Taz as well including T.N.T.  There is also a bonus stages after completing three levels in which you collect as many items you can in the allotted time to raise the score.</resource>

But he can not enjoy his idyllic life for a long time. Ray is told about the evil wizard Homncruise (yes, that's the name) who plans to conquer the world. Defeating Homncruise won't be easy: first Ray must find the magic crest of his fallen father, and build a strong team of legendary warriors, named Aquitallion. Only then will he and his comrades be ready to face Homncruise and to save the world.

In this game you wander around the world map. visiting towns and dungeons, and fighting monsters in turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective, much like in Dragon Quest games. You'll have two parties at your disposal, and will be able to switch between them at any time. One party is the Aquitallion, the &amp;quot;main&amp;quot; one, and the only one which can access plot-progressing areas. The other parties can be used for visiting dungeons and retrieving valuable items. At a certain point in the game, you'll also be able to build and to manage your own town.</resource>

The standard modes apply including Exhibition, All-Star and Season in which the player can choose either to play a full or reduced season.  The player can also choose to simulate games and watch them unfold or they also have the option to manage their team and watch the outcome of their decisions.  It also features a battery backup to allow saving of stats and games as well as two-player capabilities to allow friends to compete head-to-head.</resource>

The game is very much in the tradition of the Mortal Kombat or Street Fighter series, pitting you against opponents one at a time. Some fighters (besides the turtles) will be familiar, such as the Rat King, or even Shredder (now called &amp;quot;Cyber-Shredder&amp;quot; here).

Though even people familiar with the turtles will see differences in them. They can now, for example, do moves involving projectiles, such as &amp;quot;fireballs&amp;quot;.

The game's modes include a story mode, where you can only pick one of the turtles and go on fighting opponents in order to rescue April and Splinter, and a tournament mode, where you fight only for the fame and money.

Tenchi Muyou! Game-Hen is a strategy game with RPG elements, based on the popular Japanese Tenchi Muyo! cartoon series. The game moves from battle to battle, with the plot being revealed through cutscenes between them. The player fights the computer on turns, controlling the individuals from a party of four. The party members are selected on a separate screen before each battle, and as the game progresses new characters become available.

During the skirmish, selecting the characters brings up a menu with three command options: move, attack or end turn. A fourth transform option becomes available later, after they reach a higher level. When moving or attacking, glowing tiles on the ground show the maximum range of the action. Performing either one costs action points, shown as eight regenerating green dots on the status window, alongside basic statistics like health, defense and attack levels. Characters level up automatically while on the battlefield, increasing their abilities and receiving more powerful attacks. Health powers are also accessed through the attack menu, recovering lost points to an ailing comrade within their range. Characters can transform to a more powerful version when they have the ability to do so, and all the eight green dots are still available. The transformed unit has more powerful attacks and a wider range of movement.

After the battle, a map screen appears where the player can save the game, and choose the next battle from one of the available paths. It is possible to revisit battlegrounds, to level up before tackling stronger enemies.

The game is based on the Tenchi o Kurau manga from Hiroshi Motomiya, which presented dramatized events from the Three Kingdoms conflict, and has also seen various other video game adaptations.

While other games based on Tenchi o Kurau have been brawlers and RPGs, Sangokushi Gunyuuden instead takes inspiration from Koei's Romance of the Three Kingdoms series and puts the player in control of an entire kingdom, with the goal being to conquer the rest of China with their armies.</resource>

The game has two kinds of levels: in several scrolling platform levels, Reese runs and jumps, shooting at Terminators (in the future war level that begins the game), street punks or policemen.

The film's chase scenes are recreated in two driving sequences. Viewed from behind, Reese and Sarah must escape the Terminator's pursuit in their car, dodging incoming traffic and avoiding the Terminator's fire.</resource>

He has grown up in his little village, isolated from the outer world by a stream of lava, and has never seen anything else beside it. One day, he and some other boys hear mysterious voices coming from beyond a door the village elder forbade them to open. Unable to resist their curiosity, the boys open the door, and Ark finds a box with a strange creature inside. By opening the box, Ark damages the balance between two co-existing worlds, and all the village people are turned into stones. Now Ark has to embark on a dangerous journey - to find five Towers, and to seek there the answers to his questions, and to liberate his people from a terrible curse.

&amp;quot;Terranigma&amp;quot; is an action game with slight RPG elements. Ark levels up after having completed an important quest or cleared out an area. He can attack enemies with various weapons, using various techniques: pierce, leap, dash, etc. 

The game is closely connected to and often regarded as a part of a trilogy created by Enix, the first two games being Soul Blazer and Illusion of Gaia.</resource>

The games have a slight graphical update when compared with the original Game Boy and NES games, but the gameplay remains totally faithful to the games released for both platforms.

In Tetris, the main objective is to pile blocks that will fall down continuously, in order to create a row or &amp;quot;line&amp;quot; without spaces. For this collection, the game comes with two bonus options: 2 PLAYER GAME (absent in the NES version) and VS. COM (absent in both versions), with 3 CPU opponents available, each one representing a difficulty level (EASY, MEDIUM, and HARD, respectively).

In Dr. Mario, the objective is to eliminate all the viruses contained in a big bottle. Dr. Mario (situated in the upper-right side of the screen) will throw capsules with 6 different color combinations (Red-Red, Red-Blue, Yellow-Yellow, Red-Yellow, Blue-Blue and Blue-Yellow) in order to line up at least four viruses or capsules of the same color horizontally or vertically and to make them disappear. In this compilation, the game comes with a bonus option: VS. COM, where you'll face the CPU players: Blue Virus (EASY), Yellow Virus (MEDIUM), and Red Virus (HARD).

For competitive players in both games, there is Mixed Match, where you and a friend can play Tetris and Dr. Mario like a tournament! Adjust the handicap levels, play time, music, and other settings to balance your different skills. The game order is: TETRIS B-TYPE (clear a certain amount of lines), DR. MARIO (disinfect a predetermined number of viruses) and TETRIS A-TYPE (clear lines until the time expires). At the end of the time limit, the player with the highest score is the winner.</resource>

The devious king Bowser has cast a spell on the island's inhabitants, turning them into his mindless slaves. Only Yoshi has escaped its effects, and so he must set off to free his friends, and to defeat Bowser and break the spell.

Tetris Attack is a fact-paced action puzzler featuring the colorful cast of characters from Yoshi's Island. A stack of blocks continually rises from the bottom of the screen, and the player controls a cursor which can swap any two blocks horizontally. Make a row or column of three or more and they'll clear, potentially creating combos from new blocks falling to take their place. Combos will send large garbage blocks to your opponent, which must be eliminated by clearing a piece that is touching it, turning it into normal blocks.

The game offers a story mode against the computer, as well as a 2-player versus mode, an endless mode, a timed mode where a certain number of blocks must be cleared, and a puzzle mode where a set arrangement of blocks must be cleared in a specific number of moves. The game is based on the Japan-only title Panel de Pon.</resource>

The first task is to set up your rides within the available land, structuring convenient paths and queues and ideally leaving some space for bigger rides once they become available, and include some lakes and trees to increase the park's allure. Rides range from Teacups and Haunted Houses to the biggest most elaborate roller-coaster you can design, and water rides that loop around other rides.

Shops must also be included, so that the visitors can buy food, drinks and souvenirs - the cunning player will combine salt, sugar and caffeine settings to maximize consumer interest. Staff must be hired to keep everything running smoothly, and they will only work for what they consider a fair rate of pay.

You are competing against other Theme Parks, so don't let them get an advantage over you - monitor your success in attracting customers and financial viability closely using the supplied statistics pages. More important, ensure that research is adequately funded to produce new rides.

It can be played in three modes - Sandbox level lets you concentrate on the park design elements, while Sim and Full add more strategic features.</resource>

The player is once again given a stable to manage and must raise and race champion racehorses to be a successful breeder. The third entry includes enhanced feedback during races, letting the player know the positions of all the horses in the race and, towards the final stretch, each horse's stamina meters and exertion levels. This helps them determine how their own horses in the race are doing, and the areas that might need improvement.</resource>

It is the year 2193 and your once high arrest record has started to decline sharply as routine trackdowns end in mysterious disappearances. It is discovered that noted MIT scientist Dr. Mordecai 'Mo' Sahmbi has been sending criminals back in time to 1993 using his invention the TRAX time machine, and has gone back himself. TRAX is captured by the police, and three guesses as to who is tasked with capturing the criminals and sending them back to 2193.

As Lambert, your primary targets in this game are neo-Nazi racist Sepp Dietrich and Sahmbi himself. You do have some equipment to help you: your supercomputer S.E.L.M.A. (Specified Encapsulated Limitless Memory Archive), disguised as an AT&amp;T Mastercard and whose holographic persona resembles a British nanny, and the PPT (Pellet Projection Tube), a weapon capable of stunning a human from periods of a couple of minutes to a few hours and can fire pellets that render humans transportable to the future, disguised a keyless car alarm remote. Also, you have the ability to &amp;quot;time stall&amp;quot; (this slows the speed of images reaching your brain, allowing you to react quickly) and your Mosh-Ti (an Occidental improvement of martial arts) skills to rely on if the situation gets dire.

You'll run through the alleys of the future, through the Smithsonian (circa 1993), ride a motorcycle and jet-ski, battle criminals atop a construction site, and do so much more until you've finally captured the two fugitives.</resource>

    <resource id="8837fc3c56c0a273f9cac98f811e5fc6abd7f789" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Based off of the Jean Claude Van Damme film Timecop, this game acts as a sequel of sorts. We learned well from the film that the power time travel affords corrupts all men weaker than the Muscles from Brussels, and this has extended to the original inventor of time travel. He proclaims himself dictator of the universe, captures Van Damme as he arrives from fixing all the wrongs in the film, and challenges him to a &amp;quot;duel across time.&amp;quot; Platforming action follows across multiple periods of history.

The primary feature of this game is its digitized characters, uncommon for console games of that era. Actors were taped in front of a bluescreen and stills were taken from the video to create all characters and their animations. The effect is impressive for the SNES, though it does result in robotic enemies who do not respond well to being punched or kicked. The &amp;quot;timing,&amp;quot;, both in terms of controlling your character and fighting with enemy characters seems off through the entire game.

There are 15 levels in total, most of which are standard fighting platform levels. Three basic fighting moves are available to the character, not including jumping and crouching kicks, and not including the use of a gun with extremely limited ammo. Some vehicle levels are mixed in, and the game culminates in a jetpack duel over Los Angeles with the villainous time travel creator fellow.

The game also featured some rare use of digital voice, primarily in the &amp;quot;FBI... Get on it!&amp;quot; background theme in the first few levels.</resource>

The player takes control of Dr. Vincent Gilgamesh who has acquired a massive arsenal including pistols, machine guns, rocket launchers and many more heavy weapons and must travel through various time periods including Medieval times, prehistoric times, Ancient Rome and Egypt and even the distant future.  The gameplay is similar to Contra where the player advances through the stages, shooting at various enemies and collecting power-ups and must also avoid various traps and pitfalls scattered throughout the levels.  There are also the standard bosses at the end of each stage.</resource>

He has vowed to rid the town of the Bad Oil gang and their leader, Black Bart, within a week. Along with his sidekick Mo Crash and even more importantly his six-gun he will try to accomplish this task.

The game takes place over a week with each day being a different stage. Stages are broken down into 4 parts. The first part is a training section where players can practice shooting. The next two parts are action scenes. In the action scenes, gameplay consists of moving a cross-hair over various enemies and shooting them. The final part ends the day with a showdown. The showdown involves a one on one duel in which a draw icon will randomly pop up anywhere on the screen which must be shot then immediately afterwards the enemy the player is facing then must also be shot. This continues on until either the player's or the enemy's life bar is drained.

If a player doesn't shoot an energy canteen during a level a bonus screen will appear. The bonus screen shows a woman spinning around on a round board with stars next to her body. Shooting the stars without missing and without accidentally shooting the woman will help players pick up large amounts of money.

At the end of a level the amount of money made is tallied up. For every bullet wasted and damage taken the player loses money. The player gains money equal to the their accuracy and the amount of energy they had left at the end of the stage.</resource>

The basic plotline is the same: Professor Cuthbert Calculus gets kidnapped and the player, in the role of Tintin, needs to rescue him. The rest is more loosely adapted: in contrast to the comic, which is mostly based in Peru, this game offers many different locations all over the world.

The gameplay itself is a typical platforming action: Tintin walks through the levels while avoiding the enemies. Pretty much everyone, e.g. little girls and security guards, is out to hurt Tintin who has no means of defending himself. This means the most important aspect is learning enemy placements, their patterns and how to avoid them. But he has to hurry because of the time limit. Required for success is the usage of the two playing plains: from the player's perspective in the foreground and further towards the background. Tintin can switch between the two at any time.

Most of the six levels are platform levels, where Buster has a number of attacks to defeat the enemies he faces.  These include kicks and jumps, and a dash ability that lets you slide into enemies to defeat them, and also climb walls.

The fourth level is an exception, and consists of a game of (American) football, played with a simplified version of the rules.  The idea is simply to get a touchdown, while as usual progressing at least ten yards in four downs.  There are two plays: a running play, where you simply run as far as possible while avoiding the opposing team; and a passing play that starts with a pass that can gain you extra yards, but must be caught.

Between levels there are bonus games.  You spin a wheel to determine what game you play out of five available.

In the middle of the game, when the number of known girls was high, these &amp;quot;bombs&amp;quot; became the primary concern of the player, forcing careful planning and strategies like round-robin dating.

    <resource id="6851db16ea66d8fbb87e06d9c15f50a090890bd4" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Based on MGM's world-known cartoon, the player controls Jerry, the Mouse (in 2-Player Mode, P2 will control Jerry's nephew, Tuffy) as he explores four different worlds (movie theater, junkyard, a toy-based stage and the house inner). Game controls are simple: B Button makes Jerry/Tuffy to jump (tapping it again lightly upon landing will activate their Super Jumps), while A/Y/X Buttons will make them to throw marbles upward (Y Button) and downward (X/Y Buttons) in the enemies.

To earn extra lives throughout the game, players have two available options: the rarest and, sometimes, hardest way is to find a 1-Up icon; however, the easiest mode is to collect 100 of small balls of cheese scattered throughout the levels (Cheese Bits). Also, Jerry and Tuffy's health meters are displayed in the form of four hearts, that can be replenished through collectible larger cheese wedges (Cheese Chunks). At the end of each world, Jerry and Tuffy will take a confrontation with Tom, the Cat.

It was canceled when Ted Turner bought Hanna-Barbera in 1991 along with many other Hanna-Barbera projects being canceled. However, it's also possible that the game was canceled along with many other Hi Tech Expressions projects because of a possible company closure that same year.
A similar PCB was discovered in another collector's possession that was dumped with a Retrode 2. That dump was compared with this build and it is a 1:1 match. As such, this has been confirmed to be a good dump.

In more longer tracks, players will find a Pit Stop section, where they can enter to replenish the fuel meter (total or partially). The game has a split-screen display for 1 or 2 players. In 1-Player mode, you'll dispute the races against the computer, that has a slightly bigger speed than yours, helping to give a lot more of competitiveness. A password system was included, being possible to stop a current game and resume it later.

Through the game, players will find several obstacles scattered by the courses, like rows of iron plates or even lots of stones. In order to qualify for the next circuit, it's required to complete it at least in the 5th position, or else the game is over.</resource>

Your task is to race through 16 countries, each of which features four races, with many real-world circuits recreated in incongruous locations (such as the Monza layout in Ayers Rock, and the old Hockenheim in Vancouver). 

These four-race blocks each represent their own mini-championship, in which you race against 19 cars, needing to finish in the top 10 to continue, and with the top 6 scoring points 10-6-4-3-2-1, and the respective amount of money in thousands. This can be spent on various upgrades, ranging from engine to tires (wet and dry) and from shocks (front, side and rear) to gearboxes. The ideal approach is to buy the more expensive versions ASAP, as you get no saving when upgrading. If you win the four-race championship, you get the next password. 

You get a set amount of nitro boost to use during each race, although bonus nitros, money and instant speed-up token appear on many tracks. Hazards such as puddles, barriers and ramps are also frequent.</resource>

Koei released the game on PC Windows, the NEC PC-9801 and the Super Famicom. The goal of the game is to grow the player character's nascent corporation to be one of the largest and most profitable in the world with savvy business practice. Possibly due to the large amount of text and Japan-centric business terminology, the game was never released outside of Japan.

The PC-9801 version is considerably denser than the other two versions, featuring many additional features to create a closer proximity to actual business ownership.</resource>

The Arcade version is sometimes referred to as &amp;quot;Last Fortress&amp;quot;.

The game was followed by Daitoride (&amp;quot;Great Fortress&amp;quot;) in 1995. Like Toride it was first released in the Arcade and then to a single home console; in this case the Sega Saturn.

The player must clear all the tiles on the screen, as per usual mahjong solitaire rules, but in order to do so they have to store matching tiles along the bottom of the screen. The player's &amp;quot;hand&amp;quot; has a limited number of slots available, and if the player fills it up with pieces that don't match then they have failed. There is also a timer for the whole round that ticks down whenever the player is deliberating on their next move, and removing pairs of pieces from play will slightly refill it. There are also special power-up tiles that increase the timer.

As with mahjong solitaire, the player can only match identical tiles. The exception are the eight unique season and flower tiles, which can be paired off with any other season or flower (though it has to be two seasons or two flowers).</resource>

Having defeating the evil along with other heroes, he returned to Endor to work peacefully. Some time has passed and after growing successful in this town, Torneko grew anxious. Hearing rumors one day about a &amp;quot;Mysterious Dungeon&amp;quot;, Torneko meets with the king to ask permission to set up a new shop, closer to this Mysterious Dungeon. By exploring this cavern and returning safely with the prizes, Torneko hopes to become the most successful merchant in the world.

Torneko No Daibouken is a overhead view game similar to Hack, what might be called a &amp;quot;dungeon crawl&amp;quot;. Torneko must venture into the mysterious dungeon gathering treasure. He may equip any weapons and shields he finds there, as well as gather up items such as spell scrolls, staffs and herbs with a variety of effect. A variety of enemies, familiar to the Dragon Quest series, await him. If Torneko successfully exits the dungeon, he is able to sell any of the items he has collected. This money then goes to improve the quality of his shop and living quarters. As the game progresses, Torneko is able to store special items in the vault, which he is then able to bring with him on subsequent trips to the dungeon.</resource>

Naturally, a dictator named General Akhboob took control of the beleagured nation and began creating an army of radioactive mutants. With a virtually impenetrable stronghold, a bunch of hostages, and a legion of mutants under his command, the evil despot will stop at nothing but world domination. Only two men have the courage and idealistic naivete to take on Akhboob and his forces: Captain Carnage and Major Mayhem, also known as the Doomsday Squad.

As Captain Carnage or Major Mayhem, it is up to you or you and a friend (in simultaneous action) to rescue the hostages while shooting hundreds of mutants bent on your destruction. As you walk and run forward, backward, left, right, and diagonally through 20 battlezones of nonstop action, you'll always have your machine gun by your side. Additional weapons which you can find along the way include grenade launchers, rocket launchers, plasma machine guns, flame throwers, spray-fire rifles, defensive blades, and an assortment of bombs.</resource>

Lucky Man: Assault on Lucky Cookie Roulette&amp;quot;) is an RPG/board game hybrid based on the Shonen Jump superhero manga Tottemo! Lucky Man, about an incredibly unfortunate schoolkid who gets crushed by an alien craft and merges with the intergalactic hero Lucky Man.

Similar to something like Dokapon, the game is an RPG framed as a board game: To move Lucky Man, the player must hit a button that stops a roulette that determines how many spaces he can travel. Certain results occur depending on where Lucky Man ends his turn, from gaining bonus items to talking to NPCs to a combat situation. Combat plays out like a turn-based RPG, and Lucky Man with his fellow heroes Shouriman (Victory Man) and Yuujouman (Friend Man) fight against various unusual enemies. The goal of the game is to rescue Lucky Man's love interest Mit-chan from a mysterious kidnapper.</resource>

As with other touge racers, the goal is to catch up with an opponent and pass them without colliding with them. These races are traditionally held on the narrow and winding paths which makes overtaking other racers difficult, hence the challenge.

The game makes ample use of Mode 7 for its courses, and features twelve tracks from all over Japan. The player can also choose their motorcycle model and customize its tires, suspension, chains and brakes. The player can also change the color of their bike, or their biker's helmet, jacket or pants.</resource>

The game has a comedic angle and features expressive characters designed by Tamakichi Sakura. It was followed by a PlayStation sequel, Tower Dream 2, in 1998.

The game features a number of &amp;quot;worlds&amp;quot; the player can try out, each with different board configurations and themes. The themes run from the mundane, like Tokyo or Hong Kong, to the fantastical, like prehistoric, horror movies or space.

Gameplay

The goal of the game is to move around a board which encircles a giant grid. The player can buy property on any square on the grid that is parallel to the space they're on, increasing the rent value of that space. When other players land on the same space, they pay the controlling player(s) a specific amount of rent a la Monopoly. With some smart planning, the player can purchase many properties along the same row or column and boost their rent prices higher and higher. Building properties on adjacent spaces on the grid also creates corporations, which generate more cash and can absorb smaller companies alongside them. Corner spaces on the outer ring lead to slot machine mini-games that can earn players a bit of extra cash.</resource>

It is a sequel to Soul &amp; Sword, with a few returning characters.

After the tutorial, the player may freely walk around the world map to visit cities or discover hidden places. The objective is to find and accomplish all the quests in order to unlock the true ending. Alternate endings are also present by getting married to the different female characters, which is only possible after fulfilling specific conditions. It contains a time and weather system, with events happening only during specific moments of the year or after a certain amount of time.

Throughout the adventure, thirty characters can join the team. Each possesses unique skills (stealing, paralyzing, healing, etc.), fixed stats, and the ability to use a few weapons or spells. As there is no experience system, characters can only become stronger by using their weapons and spells or acquiring new equipments, save for the hero, Gantt, whose stats can change by completing some events.</resource>

Now its up to the brothers to save the world if they ever want to find their father.

Treasure Hunter G is a top-down RPG in which you control your party of four characters as they explore the fantasy/sci-fi game world in search for quests and grinding their stats while the plot advances. The game is divided in a world-map screen, a top-down &amp;quot;town&amp;quot; mode and a turn-based fight mode in which the characters are taken to generic tiled top-down arenas in which they select each character and move or attack depending on their action points.

Enemies can be seen on the map instead of jumping at you at random intervals, and you can freely decide whether to engage them or simply circle them around. The game uses a combination of hand-drawn sprites and CGI pre-rendered one (mostly for the main characters) with a distinct cute or Super Deformed design (as usual for most console RPGs).</resource>

    <resource id="b913eecc4dfffc49845b08148633e724a67e1402" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Players take on the challenge of one of the most beautiful and notorious golf courses in the world: Pebble Beach. These eighteen-holes demand accuracy, finesse, and even at times brute strength. The famous beach-side course is littered with sand-bunkers as well as sweeping fairways and cliff-side greens. 

Game play takes a classic approach - players control a selected golfer from a third-person perspective. Swing-control is displayed as a power and accuracy meter with which players must start and stop accordingly. Again, the classic-style putting system, complete with a topographic grid, lets the player know of the slope and elevation of the three-dimensional putting surface.

As there are no other courses to play, this game is a tribute and testament to the challenging course-design of Pebble Beach Golf Links.

The game offers a practice training mode, a tournament mode and the ability to challenge your friends in a stroke match. Oddly, this game was not sanctioned by the PGA and assumes that the golfer is always male.

It is the follow-up, but not direct sequel, to Pandora Box/Banpresto's earlier Gakkou de atta Kowai Hanashi. The game has since been added to three digital services: the Japan-only Nintendo Power cart-writing service in 1998, the Wii's Virtual Console in 2012 and the Wii U's Virtual Console in 2016.

The game uses the grim scenario of the seventh anniversary of the death of the protagonist's grandmother as a framing device for a bunch of horror stories told by the various gathered family members. The player can determine the outcome of some events through occasional multiple choice prompts, but like many visual novels the game is largely a passive experience.</resource>

It features the cast of the manga and anime Tsuyoshi Shikkari Shinasai (usually localized as &amp;quot;Hang in There, Tsuyoshi&amp;quot;) and Konami's own spin on Puyo Puyo: Taisen Puzzle-Dama (&amp;quot;Battle Puzzle Ball&amp;quot;). The goal of the game is to compete with a series of characters from Tsuyoshi Shikkari Shinasai depending on who the player selected.

Play involves stacking duos of faces of various colors. If the player completes a set of three faces - they don't have to be lined up, but they do need to be adjacent - the faces disappear. If they are next to a &amp;quot;trapped&amp;quot; face it is transformed into a normal face block. Ideally, the player completes a three-strong stack of identical-colored trapped faces and frees them in groups of three, which will then lead to a chain as those three vanish and free more trapped faces.

The game was the first home console version of Konami's Taisen Puzzle-Dama series and the second game overall. The first version was the Arcade game Taisen Puzzle-Dama released earlier the same year. Future Taisen Puzzle-Dama games would also similarly feature anime license tie-ins, as well as characters from Konami's other properties.</resource>

    <resource id="b30a8cc0e9d294ced16a31dbbaf8202552fea57f" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">The Twisted Tales of Spike McFang is an action-rpg starring the titular hero, a young vampire prince who must rescue his parents and save the inhabitants of the Vladamasco Islands from the evil Von Hesler. But is it really his handiwork, or is there someone else controlling him? Unravel the mystery while traveling to various locales, fighting Von Hesler's henchmen and picking up (CPU-controlled) companions along the way.

Spike McFang has three main methods of attack: by striking out with his cape, throwing his hat like a boomerang, or using a magic card. Cards can also heal his health or give his companions extra strength. Spike can also devour the still-beating hearts of his vanquished foes (or the dropped tomatoes of his vanquished foes if you're playing the sanitized North American version) to regain health. There are a total of four different hats that Spike can purchase as upgrades in his battle against animated garlic bulbs, bomb-throwing cats, head-spinning plants and a plethora of other dangerous enemies.</resource>

The aim is to wipe out the enemy, which has gathered around the allied airspace of 'Area 88', in a series of military aircraft-based scenarios.
 You choose one of three unique pilots; Shin Kazama, Micky Schymon or Greg Gates, each with varying abilities at damage repair, weapon handling and flying skill, and engage the enemy over a series of challenging missions. The player starts out with the weakest plane, the F8E Crusader, which can only be armed with a very basic range weapons. But, through completing various missions, enough cash can be raised to purchase higher-quality aircraft. These superior planes are more agile, have improved resilience to damage and have a greater range of fire. Furthermore, the more advanced fighters can be armed with superior special weapons, such as napalm.
 The missions include attacks on sand bases, the nuclear submarine 'Seavet' and enemy supply camps, as well as seeing off groups of airborne 'bandits' who swarm-in on Area 88.
 The enemy is plentiful, and the pace is frantic. Shoot at everything on the screen that moves, and the allied forces might just come out on top......</resource>

The game's levels are a mix of scrolling shooter and fighting game. The first part of every level is a scrolling shooter where Tekkaman Blade must survive several waves of Radam before killing two stronger boss-like Radam and meeting another Tekkaman. In scrolling shooter levels Blade can either toss his spear to defeat enemies at range or quickly slash with it to destroy bullets and enemies. One enemy type will drop different colored System Box powerups: green restores health, red destroys all enemies onscreen (except bosses), and blue turns Blade invulnerable and able to destroy all enemies upon contact (including bosses).

The end of every level is a one on one fight with an enemy Tekkaman. Each Tekkaman starts with a weapon, but the weapon will be lost if they take too much damage, forcing them to use punches and kicks. This mode can also be played in 2-player mode, where each player selects their Tekkaman.</resource>

Combat also underwent significant changes. The battles in this version are action-based; the player has to click on the enemy repeatedly to win. Unlike the PC version with its party management, the Avatar is traveling and fighting solo in this release.</resource>

Conceived to be evil by the people of Britannia, the Gargoyles are discovered to be struggling for survival against ancient forces you had not imagined. You must help the Gargoyle race by learning their culture, language and vocabulary. Adventure with your companions Iolo, Shamino and Dupre in this gigantic world riddled with monsters and puzzles.

The game features a top-down interface, animated graphics in vivid colors as well as original music, sound effects and thousands of objects to be manipulated.

It was released in 1992 for the Super Famicom by Culture Brain exclusively in Japan. The game remains much the same as the previous 1991 Super Baseball Simulator 1.000 with some new additions. This title included real life players from the NPB league; the word Jitsumeiban means Real Player Version. Additionally a World Series championship and an All-Stars option was added to this version.

In the game, there are three leagues: Central, Pacific and Ultra. Each league has six teams. In the Ultra League, pitchers and batters have special power-ups that boost their abilities which gives the game a surrealistic feel that is rare in the sports genre. Players can even create their own baseball teams and assign special moves to the players that they name themselves. The game can be played in exhibition, season or All-Stars modes.

Though the game was never released worldwide, an unofficial English translation was created by VX Translations</resource>

The game features team customization options as well as standard exhibition, tournament and all-star modes. Every mode in the game offers the option of a CPU vs. CPU match if the player simply wants to watch a simulated game.

The game also features the series's trademark &amp;quot;Ultra&amp;quot; teams, which are fictional teams/athletes that can call upon superpowers to increase their prowess as batters, pitchers and fielders.</resource>

However, they are not alone in this endeavor. After crashing his ship on Earth while in pursuit of the evil alien Bemular, the super-being Ultraman is here to help whenever the attacking aliens prove too much for humanity alone to handle. Standing hundreds of feet tall with incredible strength and amazing abilities, he can only remain on Earth for a few minutes, and so must defeat his foes before his power drains completely.

Based on the popular television show from 1967, Ultraman directly follows the story of its source material. Cast in the role of the titular Ultraman, the player must defeat many of the same monsters that appeared in the original series. Taking the appearance of a 1-on-1 fighting game, Ultraman can punch, kick, and grapple his opponent, as well as use a variety of various special moves that must be charged. However, in order to actually defeat his opponent, Ultraman must deplete their continually-recharging life bar, and at that moment hit with his most powerful special attack: the Specium Beam. As the game continues, different enemies may even find ways to avoid this most formidable attack, and Ultraman must adapt... Each stage has a time limit of only three minutes, and there are three lives and no continues.</resource>

That is until the head of the family sailed out of a disastrous voyage to find the kingdom of Prester John. The disarray that followed brought about an end to the nobility of the Franco name. 100 years have passed and Portugal has prospered through it's sailing and trading empires. Young Leon Fanco wishes to restore his family's good name and make a name for himself as a sailor. At the heart of his ambition is the fair lady, Christiana, who is desired by the likely heir to the kingdom. Towards that end, Leon has been working hard to secure finances for his first ship. With the first step of his dream complete, Franco sails out with his father's good friend as first mate, you're off to find fame, adventure and fortunes out on the sea and in uncharted waters.

Uncharted Waters is a sailing and trading simulation. Your goal is initially to sail between ports and trade goods between them to make a profit. Along the way, you may be called upon by merchants and royalty to do specific tasks. Several different nations as well as pirates roam the sea and not all have good relations with one another. You can take as long as you want and explore as much of the world as possible to complete your ultimate task of marrying Christiana, which will require your fame rating to be quite high anyway.

It might seem an odd combination, but it describes Uniracers perfectly. One of the more successful releases of the Super Nintendo's twilight era, Uniracers mixes platform-based high-speed racing, with crazy stunts and tricks.

The basic idea in most levels of the game is simple. Get your unicycle from A to B as quickly as possible, and finish ahead of your opponent. It's like Sonic, but with none of those pesky enemies, pointless power-ups and frustrating obstructions. In fact it doesn't sound like much of a game at all...

Here's the key, though. Tricks performed and landed during the race increase your speed. The better the trick, the greater your increase in speed will be.

Also, some levels are set in areas designed solely for stunts. Such levels require you to earn as many style points as possible, by doing tricks. These levels are against the clock, and a set points score, rather than an opponent.

Unicycles are stupid and difficult, and yet fun, once you get the hang of them. Much the same could be said about Uniracers...

The game was actually a sequel to the Manfred Trentz game, Turrican, but the character sprite was changed so that it could be rebranded as a movie tie-in. A rom of what appears to be the complete version of this game exists. The enemies and gameplay closely match Turrican, as to be expected. It is unknown why this game was canceled. Genesis and Game Boy versions of this game were released, and Turrican 2 was released on various computer platforms. Nintendo Power commented in the October 1992 issue that it was similar to Contra, but complained about the poor controls.
The game was originally developed using the original C64 source code and Amiga graphics as a base. At a late stage in the development, Accolade also acquired rights to produce a game spin-off of the Jean-Claude Van Damme movie Universal Soldier and decided to rebrand the game as Universal Soldier. Turrican's sprite was changed into a marine and several other substitutions were made. Amongst other changes, the eyeballs-walking-on-fingers became mini tanks, and instead of a large mech/steel dragon in the first stage, the player now faces a large representation of Dolph Lundgren's character in the film.
The three shoot 'em up stages, cut out from the port, were replaced by the developers with three original stages (a Vietnam jungle, a fortress, and a motel/car junkyard) that in theory should link the game to the film's atmosphere. The rest of the original Turrican II stages are still present and remain mostly intact in overall design, though some of them appear in different order, along with the three new levels differently scattered through them.</resource>

While the other versions are based on the Brian De Palma film starring Kevin Costner, this version is based on the 1993 remake of the original 1960's series that starred Robert Stack.

There are five different assignments (missions) to choose from, each with their own set time limit.  The first mission is set in the over the shoulder, third-person perspective in an alleyway using a shotgun to take down mobsters hiding in buildings.  The second mission is a 2D side-scroller set in a warehouse where the player must defend against gangsters and pick up counterfeiting plates scattered throughout a warehouse.  The third mission is a side-scrolling shooter, located on a dock, where the player uses a tommy gun to take out various bad guys scattered throughout the stage.  The fourth mission is a top-down shooter located at the top of a courthouse where the player must rescue hostages while defending against various bad guys.  The fifth and final mission is a first-person shooter located on the rooftops of Chicago against Al Capone himself. 

The story is told between missions through old-time looking newspapers that report on the success or the failure of the player's mission.</resource>

It features Ushio Aotsuki, a young man who discovers the powerful Beast Spear that his ancestor used to trap a vicious youkai monster called Tora (Japanese for &amp;quot;tiger&amp;quot;). Recovering the spear causes not only Tora to be free, but draws many other evil youkai out from hiding. Tora works begrudgingly with Ushio to fight back the wave of youkai out of fear of the spear's power (though as the manga progresses, Tora's reasons for helping become more altruistic).

The game is a side-scrolling brawler with short stages that culminate in boss fights with other youkai, similar to the Super Famicom GeGeGe no Kitarou game. The player can choose between Ushio and Tora to control, and each controls slightly differently: Ushio has greater range with the spear and can create shockwaves, while Tora is a powerhouse up close with his claws and can summon bolts of lightning.</resource>

The game is set in the distant future, where your job is nothing less than Colony Administrator for a new settlement on some far-flung planet. Your aim is to provide the highest Quality of Life rating for the colonists. 

You do so by ensuring that there is enough life support, power, housing, employment, police and entertainment to keep the citizens of your colony happy. Hindering your goal are random events such as solar eclipses (which can render your solar panels inactive) and also a different, hostile alien race that inhabits the planets in the many scenarios at offer. 

Not only do you have to be a good mayor but you also have to be a good general. Resources must not only be attributed to civilian research but into weapons research, intelligence and the building of tanks and spaceships, if you wish to survive long enough to see your colony flourish into a metropolis. As a rule, you will have built a strong colony before the aliens come, but the final push towards a QOL of 80% or higher can only be achieved once there is no outside threat.</resource>

The Slalom has the same set-up where the player has to finish the course in an allotted time by passing through gates, but also has to contend with twists, turns and various other obstacles in the players path. The Giant Slalom is similar except for more obstacles and a longer path.

Along with the three challenge modes, there is also a Freeride mode where the player can ski at their leisure while avoiding various obstacles such as trees, rocks and fellow skiers and snowboarders. The game also is endorsed by skiing location, Val-d'Isère, which hosted the 1992 Winter Olympics along with skier, Tommy Moe.</resource>

Let your inner high roller go wild as you try your luck at five different casino games—black jack, slots, poker, craps, and roulette. Start with $1,000 in your pocket and play your way through five casinos, each with a different theme and varying limits. Choose one of four friends to tag along and offer advice when you need it. Further enhancing the experience is the fact that you'll be presented with a slew of interactions with random casino patrons. Be careful though, your choices in these situations could either get you closer to the millions of dollars you're after, or cost you a pile of that hard-earned cash.</resource>

The game is set in the near future of 2028, and involves a pair of brothers who enter a theme park based on Jules Verne and end up trapped there. While looking for a way out and avoiding the various hostile robots that populate the park, the brothers find other human guests and also friendly animatronic robots that join the party. The park's exhibits and rides are all based on Verne's novels, such as Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea and Around the World in Eighty Days.

Various gameplay changes are present to account for the fact that the player is in a theme park rather than a fantasy setting. Instead of resting at inns, for example, the party eats at various restaurants and vending machines across the park. Weapons tend to include baseball bats and other found goods.</resource>

Each virtual reality program represents a stage in the game that Bart must play through in order to escape the machine before the programs crash.

The game consists of three side-scrolling platform stages and three stages that take place from a rear view. Bart assumes the roles of a pig, dinosaur, and baby for the platform stages. He tosses tomatoes and eggs, slides down a water slide, and drives a motorcycle in a post-apocalyptic Springfield for the three remaining stages. They are all accessed by chance via a wheel-of-misfortune.

The game is a 3D shooter similar to Star Fox by the same development studio, but with some subtle differences.

The player is cast as a soldier fighting the Aki-Do Forces, an evil empire bent on taking over the entire universe. To stop them, the player has access to an experimental mech, the Vortex, to travel the seven worlds of the Aki-Do system and destroy the bases.</resource>

    <resource id="248c363041059685bbebbdee3f1f65a06031f923" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">WWF Wrestlemania: The Arcade Game merges the personalities and action of the popular WWF TV show characters with a Mortal Kombat-style fighting game. This title features digitized graphics of 8 WWF superstars: Doink, Razor Ramon, Bret &amp;quot;Hit Man&amp;quot; Hart, Shawn Michaels, The Undertaker, Yokozuna, Bam Bam Bigelow, and Lex Luger.

Although it is a wrestling title, this game is structured a lot like a one-on-one fighter. It is very fast-paced, and features crazy special moves. Also, each match is divided into a series of rounds, much like a fighting game. Instead of each round ending in a KO, each round simply ends when you force the other wrestler(s) to fall by reducing their energy meter. Game modes include single player arcade mode, tournament mode, and vs mode for 1-on-1 multiplayer.

The game has a large variety of stages, but there is no collision detection, and the opponent racers are not programmed to stay on the track. It looks like it would have been designed to be a Mario Kart clone, complete with weapons and stage hazards, but none of that has been included in this prototype. There is a near final prototype of the Genesis version of the game, which shares many of the same graphics, notably with the background and cars. The layout of the stages is quite a bit more like Mario Kart in the SNES prototype. Of course, it is entirely possible that the final SNES version would have had the same design as the Genesis version if it was completed.</resource>

Unusually for a sumo wrestling game, each match is dictated by a sort of rock-paper-scissors system where two players play their next move from a choice of options, and the next part of the match plays out depending on the moves chosen. If a sumo reaches the edge of the ring, or loses all their stamina, they lose the match.</resource>

Players take control of a secretly assembled force and must try to restore order.

War 2410 is a turn-based strategy game in which players move various units, such as mechs, tanks, troops or planes over a grid-map. Units differ in movement and attacking range. Some ground units cannot attack air units and vice versa. Terrain also affects combat as some types of terrain, like trees or buildings improve a units defense. Attacked units always counterattack as long as the attacker is within range. The goal of most missions is to destroy all enemy units, while it is sometimes necessary to capture the enemies' bases. Units cannot not be improved or modified and every mission starts with all units already in place.</resource>

War 3010 is a turn-based strategy game in which players move spaceships over a grid-map. There are different types of ships, such as Fighters, Marauders or Destroyers, that differ in movement range and weapon power. Weapon power is also divided into long and short range, i.e. a ship that is very good at long range combat may have poor close ranged weapons etc. During combat, the following actions can be chosen from a menu: Movement, Attacking, terrain information, unit information, a map of the battlefield, overview of all units, including those of the enemy; and an option to scout planets for technology. When an attacking unit is within range of an attacked unit, the attacked unit will always counter-attack (if it isn't destroyed first). In later missions it becomes possible to scout planets for technology and upgrade ships, as well as take control of space stations to build new ships. Ships cannot be taken into the next mission however.

Tamolympic&amp;quot;) is a party mini-game collection based on the Japanese TV show of the same name. The show was a daily hour-long comedy variety show featuring recurring guests and various skits and interviews, hosted by the shades-wearing comedian Tamori (whose real name is Kazuyoshi Morita). It aired from 1982-2014 and made several longevity records in the process.

The game allows for up to four players, but only two players ever play at once: most of the mini-games are based on completing a task within a set time or with a certain amount of precision, so all players don't need to play simultaneously. Instead, the first pair of players will play each mini-game, followed by the second pair (or two-and-one, if the three-player mode was selected). These mini-games have a comedic edge to them and vary from bowling with a snooker cue to a Simon Says game that involves clapping the correct way to certain goofy poses Tamori makes.

Due to the license, the game was never released outside of Japan.</resource>

Instead of directly controlling the monsters and bombs that are falling down, the player controls Toad who has to carry around stacks of monsters and bombs and to combine them in the right way. One bomb plus at least two monsters of the same color have to be combined to make them disappear. If five or more objects are cleared at the same time, a diamond will appear. Destroying the diamond will clear all monsters of the diamond's color.
There are four different ways to pick up objects. The A button lets Toad pick up the whole stack that is in front of him, the B button lets him only pick up one object, even if it's in the middle of a stack, the Y button lets him kick a monster or bomb that's in front of him and the X button places him on top of the stack that he is carrying. He can also run up walls and stacks to catch falling objects out of the air or to pick up certain parts of a stack.</resource>

The runestones are scattered through time and across the continents and you must find them before the Warlock does.

The gameplay is simple.  You go through different stages fighting of creatures and then finding the runestones.  You fight off enemies by simply blasting them with this energy, using this orb you have with you, or you can use a spell to kill them.  There are some puzzles in the game too.  Some of the battles with the tougher enemies require some strategy to defeat them.</resource>

Years later, survivors of this disaster live on boats or man-made islands called Atolls.  Everyone in this new world is looking for a mythical place called Dry Land, which people believe that there is a map to Dry Land on a little girl's back named Enola.  A band of pirates who live an oil tanker called the Smokers are after Dry Land and they are trying to get Enola for the tatoo on her back.  A nameless drifter who has adapted to the new world and this causes him to have gills and webbed feet, gets involved in this whole &amp;quot;quest for Dry Land&amp;quot; so to speak and becomes responsible for Enola and the woman who looks after her named Helen.

You play as the nameless drifter only known as The Marnier.  You play through three types of gameplay.  The first type of gameplay involves you sailing in a some-what big area and clearing the area of Smokers. There is a second type of these sailing levels add something else.  You can save the Atollers from The Smokers.  The second type of gameplay is the swimming.  You swim underwater avoiding sea creatures and collecting items for money to use at the shop after you kill off Smokers on the Atolls.  Killing of The Smokers is the third type of gameplay. You run through the Atolls with your big knife at first and then you get three more weapons along the way which are a pistol, a speargun, and a machine gun.</resource>

The gameplay is similar to many other hockey games with the standard modes such as Exhibition, Season, Playoffs or even a &amp;quot;Just Play&amp;quot; option that instantly took the player to a random game.  There is also a &amp;quot;Simulation Mode&amp;quot; that gives the game an authentic feel complete with penalties or an &amp;quot;Arcade Mode&amp;quot; that was more action oriented and with less rules.  A battery back-up keeps extensive track of stats and has a two-player option as well.</resource>

It's Friday, it's 10:30 and like usual, Wayne and Garth are presenting their TV show. First they start off by reading a top-10 list of the worst games they recently played at the arcade. Then Wayne accounts on how he and Garth were suddenly sucked into a video game, and Garth was kidnapped by the mysterious Zantar. &amp;quot;Weeuuu, weeuuu, weeuuu!&amp;quot; FLASHBACK, and now you're suddenly in control of Wayne as he must embark upon a quest to save his good pal Garth.

You must jump, fight and rock your way through 4 different levels which include Kramer's Music Store, Stan Mikita's Donut Store, Gas Works and Surburbia. Using Wayne's guitar as your sonic weapon, it's most excellent noise will bring death to various enemies. Will you save Garth from the evil purple clutches of Zantar? SCHWING!</resource>

In the game, which plays as a prequel of the Valkyrie games, you control Xandra as he leaves his enchanted forest in order to get help for his family. This will eventually lead him to meet up with our beloved Valkyrie and mark the beginning of their adventures.

Xandra has all the abilities of a standard platformer character, which allow him to jump around and navigate the many obstacles found in the game. Additionally he's armed with a pitchfork which he can use to impale his enemies and stick to some surfaces. Collecting coins allow him to purchase extra lives, but there are no added weapons or spells as in the Valkyrie games.</resource>

The controls reflect this, with moving the controller to the right actually moving the character down and right, moving it down and right moving the character down directly, and so on. Each level is played out against a time limit, and the paths through the level aren’t always clear-cut. There are four different types of doors, each of which needs a particular icon to pass (the icons represent the door type, such as ice or bricks, rather than hot water or a key, or anything you’d logically expect to clear the path). You can avoid the baddies, which may be the best option, as killing them costs you some energy –this reduces the significance of the points system.</resource>

It's raining bullets and there are explosions everywhere. After an intense battle they enter the saloon where they dispose of every cowboy in sight while redecorating the interior. Our heroes flee the scene by climbing on the roof, but what's that sound? ... it's a HUGE robot!
Wild Guns is a shooter with a western &amp; Sci Fi theme. Gameplay is somewhat similar to the Time Crisis &amp; House of the Dead games, with the exception that the game isn't played from a first-person perspective but from a third-person perspective. You control your on-screen character as well as the aiming crosshair. Select either Clint or Annie and shoot down tons of enemies while dodging bullets and jumping over incoming rockets.
After the Carson City level, the action continues in Desolation Canyon, an ammunition depot, a gold mine and a armored train . Finally there's a showdown with the big bad guy.</resource>

    <resource id="1f3630387979aa6579844199afa860bdb668e3a5" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">WildSnake is a puzzle game in which the player must manage falling snakes in a  confined space and keep the snakes from reaching the top of the space. Snakes fall and slither until they reach a resting spot on the floor of the space. A snake will destroy any other snakes of the same color and pattern that it touches with its head on the way down, which often has the chain effect of loosening the pile of snakes so that all the snakes slither into new positions, possibly eliminating even more snakes.

The game is played against a selection of backgrounds including desert, forest, water, or grass. Further, there are 7 game grids including the standard grid (a tall rectangle), X, plus, flask, Diabolo (an hourglass pattern), T-square, and obstacle (with a number of intermediate blocks).

The player starts out as a nestling and earns higher and higher distinctions taken from the snake realm (garter snake, water snake, boa, mambo, python, king cobra, etc.) as more snakes are cleared. Also, as the level increases. more types of snake patterns must be handled. Sometimes, there is a flashing red snake that eliminates the first snake it touches. Further, there is occasionally an unstoppable snake that barrels down to the bottom of the space, eliminating all snakes in its path.

The game can be played with 1 or 2 players in either easy, normal or hard mode. In the single player mode, the player can choose whether the preview showing the next snake will be shown. In 2-player mode, there is always a preview window. In fact, there is a queue of 3 snakes between the 2 player spaces from which the next snake is drawn. As a bonus during competition, multiple snake eliminations by one player result in obstacles appearing in the space of the opposing player.

You're a 2nd Lieutenant just out of the Academy, with some good work under your belt. You're posted to Tiger's Claw, the flagship of the Confederation Fleet.  Will you help the Confederation to victory, or go down in infamy? 

Wing Commander is a space combat simulator interspersed with shipboard dialogs. Onboard the ship, you can save/load game, visit the bar to get the latest gossip, or go on to the next mission briefing, and the 3D space combat part. 

The 3D space combat have you sitting in the cockpit, where you control the craft like roll, turn, up/down, afterburner, as well as fire guns and launch missiles. There are four different crafts on the Confed side, each with different flight characteristics and armament. You will have a wingman on each mission, and you should keep the wingman alive as the wingman will help you if you issue the right orders. You can also taunt the enemy. You'll be fighting several different types of enemy fighters and capital ships, and even combat a few Kilrathi aces. 

When the mission is complete, land back onboard the ship and get ready for the next one. The campaign tree have both winning and losing paths. 

Wing Commander featured a hybrid bitmap/3D graphics  engine that allowed even 286's to display detailed 3D graphics to an extent never before possible. With EMS available, it can display even more detailed graphics and in-cockpit animations.</resource>

Once they arrive, they find that the colony has been completely destroyed by a new Kilrathi secret weapon, with no survivors. The Tiger's Claw is then ordered to pursue the Kilrathi fleet into their own space and destroy this new weapon - without reinforcements or the ability to resupply...

The Secret Missions campaign adds 16 new missions to fly. Unlike the main game, there is no branching mission tree - progress is linear. There are also several new ships: a Confederation corvette, Kilrathi and Confederation freighters and of course the Kilrathi dreadnought with the secret weapon itself.

Characters from the main game can be transferred into the add-on, which also includes a &amp;quot;Mission Selector&amp;quot; to fly any of the missions from the original game.

Both of these enhanced versions were released on the Saturn and PlayStation, though only the first saw a Super Famicom version. The series saw a proper sequel in 1998 with Winning Post 3.</resource>

Frank Baum's classic story as strongly influenced by MGM's 1939 musical.  To a lesser degree, individual levels adapt locations from the 1993 Wizard of Oz Animated Series by DIC by using settings from the series, such as Time Town.

The game is a platform adventure, which highly encourages exploration.  The action is split into four worlds.  In each of the first three worlds, the Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Lion can be found, while in the last rather than gain a companion the witch must be fought.  After gaining a companion, the characters may be switched on the fly, and each companion has significantly different attacks and abilities.  Several of the levels require using a combination of all of these abilities to fully explore. The game also includes a variety of mini-games which gives the player a chance to play as Toto also.

All levels can be revisited once passed and doing so required both for the purposes of stocking up on items and to find the Emerald City tickets which are required to enter the final area.</resource>

It is the fourth in a series of &amp;quot;gaiden&amp;quot; Wizardry games developed by Japanese studio Access and influenced heavily by Sir-Tech's core Wizardry series. The game was fan translated in late 2016.

Throb of the Demon's Heart is distinctive for the Wizardry series for adapting a lot of Japanese imagery and monsters in the familiar Wizardry format. This gives it a more home-grown feel among the Japanese-exclusive spin-offs, and heavily draws from Japanese folklore and religion.

It is the first Wizardry Gaiden to be released on a system other than the Nintendo Game Boy, and is also the last in the series. Many more Japanese Wizardry spin-off games would follow, however.</resource>

While the basic gameplay of exploring levels, shooting enemies, collecting treasures, keys and power-ups remain the same, only half of the original game's 60 levels have been retained. Each of those 30 levels (grouped into six missions, with two levels being secret ones) is a simplified version of an original level. The end bosses for the missions are taken from both Wolf3D as well as its sequel, Spear of Destiny.

Other changes from the original include new power-ups: an ammo box (taken from Spear of Destiny) and backpack that increases the maximum amount of ammo that can be carried.

The original's weapons (knife, pistol, machine gun, chaingun) all return, but there are also two completely new tools of destruction: a flame thrower and a rocket launcher.</resource>

Wolverine, aka Logan, searches desperately for clues about his past and his identify. Using the computers of the X-Men mansion, Wolverine soon receives coordinates to somewhere in Canada and is told to come alone. As the missions and levels progress he finds clues which lead him inevitably on to the next level.

The main character has a very large selection of combat moves, and also has great agility and the ability to climb walls using his wrist-spikes. Bonus pickups are provided in the level maps. Many of them are hidden very thoroughly which invites the player to use Wolverine's agility and climbing abilities to explore every corner. The levels include a secret lab, a ninja training camp, a hallucinogenic world, and others.</resource>

    <resource id="d2bf73df31d3e016b5b70ec30f73fa3868553782" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">There was once a great scientist and inventor named Gepetto, who lived on an island farm together with his creations, his robotic helper, the pixie Tinker, and his pet animals. His greatest creation was an artificial boy named Pino. No, he was not carved from wood, but looked just like a real boy - only he could turn his head 360 degrees. But Gepetto was arrested for an unknown reason. The boy Pino looks like a real boy, but he was completed just a few moments ago, and he knows absolutely nothing. All he can do is wander aimlessly, poking objects and turning his head. It is up to you, the player, to make Pino a real man!

In this simulation/role-playing game, you must use the robotic pixie Tinker to educate Pino. You can move Tinker around, examining objects and collecting them in an adventure-like fashion. Pino will automatically follow you to the direction you are facing, but will continue walking until you stop him. He will also pick objects and make his own &amp;quot;experiments&amp;quot; with them. Your goal is to train PIno in various disciplines. His stats can be raised in a RPG style: reading books increases his intelligence, throwing a ball increases his dexterity, and so on. By praising or scolding Pino you will gradually make him understand what should be done and what not.

There is also a two-player mode that allows friends to compete head-to-head.

The main gameplay is the same as others with an overhead view with a third-person perspective for penalty kicks.  The rules and regulations are up to date and can actually be changed to suit the players style of choice.

It features up to 4 teams of 4 worms, aiming to destroy the others on a generated terrain. Each worm has 100 hit points, and dies when his hit points fall to 0. Upon death, a worm explodes, causing damage to everyone around.

Gameplay is turn-based. Each turn, the player can control one specific worm from his team. The worm can crawl left and right or jump. However, there is a time limit to make a move; also, if the worm falls from a great height, it loses health and the turn ends immediately; and if a worm falls into water or offscreen, it dies. Each turn, a worm can also make a single attack: the player can aim up and down, choose a weapon and then fire it. After attacking, the turn ends. 

There's a lot of weapons available - the standard ones as bazookas (which is affected by the (random) wind settings and gravity) and grenades. The others include a Fire Punch, dynamite, air strikes, and utilities such as ropes and girders.

There are 10 styles of terrain, ranging from forests and deserts to Candy land and the moon (complete with affected gravity). Shots leave craters in the ground, and complex tunnels can be formed.</resource>

The city is run down and controlled by a warlord named Raptor. Raptor has unleashed an army of ruthless, mutating Morphs upon the city to enforce his brand of order. Only two special forces agents, Slash and Alix do not submit to Raptor's will. Raptor decides to hatch a plan to kidnap Alix, so Slash, and more importantly his magic X-Kaliber sword, will come to him in an attempt to try and rescue her.

The game consists of two modes. The first modes gameplay consists of side-scrolling action. The player can jump and swing a sword at enemies. The player can also deflect projectiles with the sword.

The second mode is a two player duel that is set up like the one on one boss fights but is between two human controlled players.</resource>

    <resource id="a7de717ed78b566df417e0550482eeefad1633ef" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Because of a rise of anti-mutant activity in Genosha, Professor Xavier uses Cerebro to scan the island nation and discovers Apocalypse's presence there. Genosha's government is apparently using Apocalypse to bring their mutant population under control. However, Xavier suspects Apocalypse to follow his own plans and sends five X-Men, Cyclops, Wolverine, Psylocke, Beast and Gambit, to investigate.

X-Men: Mutant Apocalypse combines the gameplay of a side-scrolling brawler like Final Fight with elements of a platformer, that is, players have to fight various enemies and survive the occasional jumping-puzzle. Most levels also feature mid- and end-bosses in form of robots, monsters or known Super-Villains.

Each character has unique abilities and special moves: Cyclops uses his Optic Blast to attack enemies from a distance, Wolverine can climb walls, Psylocke is very agile and the best jumper of the team, Beast can cling to the ceiling while Gambit throws explosive cards at his enemies. Special moves are quite similar to those found in Street Fighter II (Wolverine has a Dragon-Punch-style attack and Gambit's Double Kick is virtually identical to M. Bison's Scissors Kick), and require similar button combinations.

While most stages are unique for each character, some can be played with any of the X-Men. Progress is saved via password.

Their fighting is interrupted by the threat of invasion from a much more potent alien race. The 3 planets find that they are able to set aside their differences long enough to battle their shared menace.

Each planet sends a warrior to deal with the threat. There is a robot named Triton, a cat-like quadruped named Panthera, and a giant red bipedal insect alien name Alcedes. The single player of the game controls one of these characters at a time and can switch at any time. If the current character loses all of his health, the player is sent back to the start of the level and that one character receives a health refill.

Each character has special attributes that help the team. For example, Panthera's relatively small size allows him to squeeze into spots where the other 2 characters can not travel. The characters can gather a number of unique powerups and weapons to help them on their mission.</resource>

The player, as the young witch Yadamon, her human friend Jean and her guardian fairy Timon, must navigate a series of screens to solve puzzles and reach the conclusion of the story. The game uses the SNES Mouse peripheral for its numerous puzzles.

Yadamon is based on the anime of the same name about the eponymous troublemaking witch princess, who is banished to the human world to learn from her errors and to quench her curiosity about its high-tech wonders. The anime ran from August of 1992 to July of 1993, ending shortly before the release of this game.</resource>

    <resource id="1af0e5cea967860010e9edf1914f5476fcfdaf17" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Yakouchuu is an adventure game published by Athena Co. for the Super Famicom (SNES) platform. The title translates to Phosphorescent Animalcule (animalcule meaning a microscopic animal, a portmanteau of animal and molecule) and specifically to Noctiluca scintillans.

It is a &amp;quot;sound novel&amp;quot; in the vein of Chunsoft's hits Otogirisou and Kamaitachi no Yoru (localized as Banshee's Last Cry): the player reads a novel-like story as the text appears on the screen with a static backdrop and background sounds to set the scene. They also occasionally make choices which can determine the route of the story. Yakouchuu concerns the ship &amp;quot;Diana&amp;quot; and its captain, who is the player-named protagonist, and crew as it sets off on an inauspicious journey.

The game was ported to the Game Boy Color in 1999. The same year, it saw a sequel for the N64: Yakouchuu II: Satsujin Kouru.</resource>

The player is a young boy called Magu Magu, who travels across the world with his friend: a giant light pink flightless (mostly) bird called Yam Yam. The duo move around talking to NPCs in various villages, picking up quests to complete.

When moving around between villages, the game switches to its core gameplay mode: a Z-axis shoot 'em up reminiscent of Space Harrier, where the player moves left and right as they scroll automatically forward. Enemies fly in from the horizon, as do various useful items, and the player has to survive the journey from one location to the next. They can use the experience they earn from defeating enemies to become stronger as well as increase their stock of cash to buy upgrades and power-ups. After every quest is complete, the game resets the player's levels and cash back to their defaults.</resource>

Both games were adapted from the eponymous manga artist's graphic novel adaptation of the ancient Chinese novel. Specifically, they were based on an anime adaptation of the manga, released close to the same time.

The second game presents three new scenarios and does away with the month-specific actions of the original, allowing the player to perform any action on their turn. It's also been graphically updated. It is still superficially similar to Koei's better known Romance of the Three Kingdoms series of strategy sims.</resource>

It plays similarly to the Dokapon series: the player, as one of the major warlords of the Romance of the Three Kingdoms (called Sangokushi in Japan), must move around a board taking territory and fighting in one-on-one battles with NPC bandits and soldiers. Other squares on the board lead to various events that change the player's status or help/hinder them in other ways.

Yokoyama Mitsuteru Sangokushi Bangi is based on manga artist Mitsuteru Yokoyama's acclaimed historical manga that retells the Romance of the Three Kingdoms story. However, characters are drawn in a more comedic super deformed style to highlight that the game is a less serious offshoot.</resource>

The player controls a cursor on the grid that is used to rotate individual lines in a manner similar to a Rubik's Cube. When a single row or column contains all matching cookies, the row is cleared from the grid. The grid grows in size from cookies entering from the top and right sides of the playing field and a game over occurs when the grid overflows. A sixth cookie type, shaped like Yoshi's head, occasionally appears that acts as a wild card, used to help clear lines of any other cookie.</resource>

Hidden areas and other secrets can be unlocked by shooting at large gates. There are bosses along the way that must be destroyed before players can move on to the next area.

Naturally, it is your job to save this world and also to rescue the aforementioned woman who has been kidnapped by the Shadow King. This is done in typical action adventure fashion: you have to fight enemies using spells that are gathered during the progress of the game as well as solve puzzles and use several objects. What sets Young Merlin apart from other action adventures is the fact that there is no text in the entire game, instead, icons are used to represent conversations, furthermore, the game uses passwords,instead of a battery to record the players progress.</resource>

Always looking for an adventure, Adol joins him and soon finds out the cause of this new evil.

Ys III breaks away from the &amp;quot;bumping into enemies&amp;quot; battle system of the first two games and allows Adol to control his sword in a variety of directions.  As well as changing the battle system, the game is now side scrolling instead of the previous games top-down view. Adol also now has the ability to jump.  Not new to the series is the use of magical rings which give Adol different powering up abilities such as healing and shielding.  The game also uses various key items found along the way to solve minor puzzles and progress the story.

Suddenly, Adol notices a bottle, thrown onto the shore. It contains a letter, written in a foreign language, in which an unknown person asks Adol to come to his land and save it from a mysterious evil. Adol decides to accept the offer, and thus his adventure begins again...

Ys IV: Mask of the Sun is an action RPG with a combat system like the earlier Ys games. An enemy should be rammed from the sides in order to hurt him. If performed incorrectly, the player will get hurt himself. It's also possible to use magic and position oneself strategically in battle so that the enemy won't be able to inflict any damage.

In this fifth installment of the series, the combat has been somewhat simplified to resemble a more classical action RPG style. Adol can fight monsters using melee and magical techniques, and defend himself by pressing the Y button at the right time. The ability to jump has been also added.

Combat is depicted as a series of dramatic cutaways as each fighter launches their attacks and the other tries to defend or evade them.

YuYu Hakusho, an anime series about a teenage delinquent that is recruited by the underworld to fight demons and spirits that have escaped into the normal world, saw multiple adaptations for the Super Famicom and other consoles. Most are straightforward fighter games, though this and its predecessor YuYu Hakusho use this timing-based variant.</resource>

Like its 1993 contemporary Yuujin: Janjyu Gakuen, it heavily features the artwork of anime artist U-Jin, best known for his eroge manga (though the game itself does not contain any pornographic material).

Every turn each character rolls a dice that moves them that many spaces around the board. Along the way they will find cash, new weapons, health pick-ups and other items. They will also encounter monsters, and must beat them in janken (rock-scissor-paper) matches to remove them from the board. The goal for every player is to defeat the monster that holds the key to the exit, and then reach the exit with the key. The player can choose between four heroines, each with different starting stats/cash.</resource>

Yuuyu no Quiz de Go! Go! is a quiz game from Taito that uses the likeness of teen idol Yukiko &amp;quot;Yuuyu&amp;quot; Iwai. The player answers questions on various topics from anime to politics to score points, making sure not to accrue too many wrong answers. Success is based on a percentage rather than a quota: in order to pass a round with a requirement of 60, the player has to correctly answer three out of every five questions (or better).

Yuuyu was a member of the idol group Onyanko (Kitten) Club, which were hugely popular in Japan during the late 80s. She emcees the in-game quiz show via digitized photos and voice samples, introducing the many rounds and frequently chanting &amp;quot;Go! Go!&amp;quot;.</resource>

Zan II: Spirits is the first Super Famicom game in Wolf Team's series of strategy sims set in historical Japan. It was eventually followed up with a sequel, Zan III: Spirits.

As with its thematically-similar contemporaries, like Shingen the Ruler or Nobunaga's Ambition, Zan II puts the player in the geta of a Japanese feudal lord, or daimyo, with designs to wrest control over the rest of Japan from the other daimyos. The game is more focused on warfare than day-to-day resource management, with armies of samurai marching across the map to attack fortresses and pagodas that host enemy flags.</resource>

Zan III Spirits is the third game in Wolf Team's series of warring states era-set strategy war sims. While similar to Koei's Nobunaga's Ambition series in many ways, the Zan games are far more focused on warfare and logistics. Zan III is also the second in the Zan series to be released on the Super Famicom: most of the Zan series only appeared on Japanese home computers like the PC-9801 and FM Towns. The player is once again asked to lead the armies of their chosen daimyo (warlord) in an effort to conquer the rest of 16th century Japan.

Zan III Spirits is an adaptation of Zan III: Tenun Ware ni Ari for the PC-9801, which was originally released in December 1993 four months prior. Zan III Spirits, like its SFC predecessor Zan II Spirits, was modified for its console release to make it work with the limitations/strengths of the system.</resource>

Following the template laid by the classics of the genre, the game casts you as any of the 16 wrestling stars and then throws you to the ring to grapple the hell out of your opponent until one of you emerges victorious. You can attack your opponent with several moves (unique to each character) and upon &amp;quot;locking-on&amp;quot; by getting too close to the other wrestler you can execute grapples and throws.

The game uses 2D graphics from a heightened camera view and includes a plethora of game modes including single player Championship and Tournament modes (with single or Tag variants for both), 2 Player Vs., Team Battle, and a Training in which you can learn the basics of the game.</resource>

Unlike the other games in the series, Fight da Pon is a comedic/parodic take on the circuit, and features various AJPW wrestlers in a super deformed chibi style that exaggerates their personalities.

The game features multiple modes, but the core battle system requires using cards at opportune moments. Each card depicts a type of wrestling move, such as a suplex or clothesline, and the player can use them to counter and overpower their opponent. The game's story mode(s) plays out like a board game with occasional bouts.

The game was released in June 1994 in Japan exclusively. It is the third of four Super Famicom Zen-Nippon Pro Wrestling games from Natsume and Masaya.</resource>

Zengoku Juudan Ultra Shinri Game (&amp;quot;National Longitudinal Slice Ultra Psychology Game&amp;quot;, referring to how the in-game game show selects a region for a question by picking its longitude) is a quiz show for the Super Famicom that opts for questions of a more personality-test nature. With every Shinri Game, these questions are presented with a distinct framing device: in Zengoku Juudan's case, the game is presented as if it was a TV game show that pulls its questions from specific regions and prefectures of Japan.

It follows three previous Shinri Games for the system, but isn't a true sequel - The Shinri Game IV, released on PlayStation in 1998, is the &amp;quot;true&amp;quot; fourth The Shinri Game.</resource>

The game also features three distinct modes: a story mode, that intersperses its racing with dialogue-heavy cutscenes and adventure game elements; a versus mode for one or more players; and a &amp;quot;ministory&amp;quot; mode that has much less plot between races and no adventure elements.</resource>

Not many, that's for sure!

Zig Zag Cat is an unusual fusion of Breakout and a scrolling shooter. During action stages the player's avatar walks forward while attempting to keep their cat from bouncing off the bottom of the screen. The cat can break most obstacles by hitting them, and all obstacles will be broken if they collide with the avatar. By breaking blocks money and temporary paddle upgrades can be uncovered, such as ones that increase the size or the paddle, let you fire bullets, or allow you to curve the cat while it is moving. Several times during each stage a black octopus block will appear, and it must be destroyed by the cat before the player's avatar will continue moving forward. While the avatar is totally unharmed from walking through any enemies or blocks, some enemies and all bosses have the ability to fire projectiles at him which do cause damage, and if all health is lost from projectiles then a life will be lost just as if the cat had fallen off the screen.

In between action stages the player will enter an Inn. At the Inn he can save, talk to the locals, play a bonus board to earn additional money, buy temporary paddle upgrades, and check his progress on his trip around the island.</resource>

If the shape is of a different color, or it is hit when collecting a line of similar shapes, your piece exchanges colors with the shape.</resource>

    <resource id="ca4ec9468c6c897917d3a6c64748c3859ce0b5c6" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Based on the first season of the TV series of the same name, your character is an officer of the UEO: The United Earth Oceans Organization. You begin the game inside a training simulation, which upon successful completion ensures your transfer to the crew of the seaQuest DSV where you will be called upon to perform the same duties.

Primarily, your function is to navigate the seaQuest Deep Submergence Vessel around the underwater map to various 'mission areas' where you will be called upon to use the on board vehicles to accomplish some task. Typical missions include salvage operations, rescue operations, disarmament of underwater explosives, termination of enemies and exploration. Damage of underwater property is deducted from your budget and completion of objectives adds to it. The money must be used to resupply weapons and buy additional vehicles. Underwater is a dangerous place.

The vehicles you have at your command include

1. Speeder: A simple two-man vessel designed entirely for speed. It is also a combat vessel and may fire forwards, move up &amp; down and change orientation between facing left and facing right
2. Stinger: A prototype &amp;quot;next generation&amp;quot; attack vessel, this one-man sub allows you to orientate in any direction to fire your weapon accurately.
3. Sea Crab: A slow vehicle used for excavation, mining, and rescue missions. It is the only vessel that can dock with other vessels and one of only two that can pick up undersea objects for transport. It comes with a water jet to clear debris and a retractable drill
4. Sea Truck: Slow and bulky, this vessel may move up and down and change it's orientation between left and right. It's weapons are torpedoes and mines which may be dropped behind it. Furthermore it can also pick up undersea objects for transport
5. Remote (HR) Probe: Small and agile, this vehicle contains only a very simple weapon. It's main purpose however is underwater welding and repair of objects. It can also activate switches
6. Darwin - Intelligent Dolphin and seaQuest mascot: Darwin the Dolphin is perhaps the most agile of the vehicles, and may take off in bursts of speed. However Darwin has no weapons with which to defend himself and is very vulnerable. Darwin is able to get into tiny spaces that none of the other vehicles can reach. Darwin is able to activate switches.</resource>

There are no rival companies; the player controls the only one in the city and the game is resultingly fairly open-ended. There are two types of transport that the player's company can take: passengers or building materials. The former is more likely to be profitable, but building materials allow the city to grow. Wherever the building materials are delivered, they can be taken and used to construct buildings for the city. These start with houses, but eventually, as an area grows, roads, and shops and other buildings are built. These can provide extra revenue for a passenger service, but also allowing the city to develop and grow can be seen as a goal in itself. As well as the buildings built by the computer, in response to the materials being present, the player can construct their own buildings, such as ski resorts and hotels, and make profits from them if the conditions are right.</resource>

Max is a kid who possesses a magic cap that allows you to travel across different world and to save people who get in trouble in other dimensions. But his archenemy, the demonic Skull Master, has recently locked all the portals Max was using for inter-dimensional travel. However, the Skull Master has kept some of the portals for himself, keeping there some of his destructive weapons. It's time to destroy those weapons and to stop Skull Master!

This is a platform game in which you control Max himself or one of his two side-kicks (that doesn't influence the gameplay). You travel through several different worlds. Your goal is to find Skull Master's weapons, which are scattered around the level, and to destroy them. The levels are timed, and there are also plenty of enemies who will disturb you on your way to the goal.</resource>

In the game, players partake in a Reversi-esque game and get to choose a number of stages to play on and the type of kitten they want to use. They can also change the rules and settings to an extent. It's red versus blue, with a random player going first. As players would in Reversi or Othello, sandwich kittens vertically, horizontally or diagonally (though since the game is isometric, it's hard to say vertically or horizontally). They will change all the kittens in between to a certain color, but can additionally select cats in the area to do battle with. Winning allows players to further convert cats to their cause. There are special items which have certain effects such as making players lose a turn, but, there isn't much interruption from them.</resource>

In each level, Barbie starts by going left to right with forced scrolling.  She has a default speed and can speed up as well.  She must avoid moving obstacles by moving up and down and controlling her speed.  If she hits one, she loses a chance and it's game over if she runs out of chances.  She must pick up items which grant point bonuses and extra chances.

There is also a camera item to pick up which brings you to a magazine cover shoot.  You are shown a cover with barbie wearing an outfit which is themed to the level.  You must then go to her dressing room and dress her in a matching outfit.  You are also given separate control of the colors of three different components and must match these.  You are awarded points for each correct match.

When you reach the right side of the level, you are given a runway practice.  This consists of four positions on the runway floor labeled to tell you which button you must press at each one.

Barbie then goes back through the level right-to-left.  On the return trip, there is a handbag to pick up.  This brings you to another magazine cover.  You then go to a makeup mirror where you must match Barbie's hairstyle, earrings, eyeshadow and lip and nail color to the cover.  Again, you are awarded points for each item which you get correct.

When you reach the left side of the level, you must then do Barbie's runway walk that you were given earlier.  You are awarded points for each station at which you perform the correct move.

Barbie then continues to the next level.  There are a total of four: Barbie driving down the street, skating on the beach, walking through a ski resort and walking through the park.

The game follows the story of the manga to some extent.Besides the obvious graphical upgrade moving from 8-bit to 16-bit, Koutei no Chousen now allows the player to see a map of the pitch to help them strategize.</resource>

Chester the cheetah lives in the Four Corners Zoo together with other animals. One day he decides to leave the zoo and to search for the legendary Hip City. Riding his trusty motor scooter, with a map in the paws, Chester encountered the nasty brute Mean Eugene. True to his habit of stealing and destroying things, Mean Eugene took the map from Chester, tore it to pieces, and scattered them all across United States of America. Chester must now visit various locations in the country to retrieve the map pieces and to find a way to Hip City.

The player may explore the game world in a non-linear fashion. At any time, there are three levels available and the player may tackle them in any order. Each solved level leads to additional two. On each level, the player must find the missing map piece, proceed to the exit, and defeat the level boss. Chester can dash and kill enemies by jumping on their heads. He dies from one hit, unless he has a pack of the cheetahs snack at his disposal. In this case, he'll recover full health.

The chief wizard realizes that the demon Balaam is trying to link the world of Wozz with the world of humans. Only a human hero can stop Balaam, and the wizard's teleporting magic brings... three young humans: the Japanese girl Reona Kitazato, and two boys: the American Shot Phoenix and the Chinese Chun Chingtao. Will those youngsters be able to stop Balaam?

The game is a traditional console-style RPG similar to Breath of Fire: turn-based battles are viewed from an isometric perspective. You control all three characters as a party, but in the beginning of the game you choose one of them as the main character, and therefore will see the game from his/her perspective. In case the characters split up, you'll be able to control only the one you chose.

This group originally released an obscure game similar to this but with a wider audience in mind, various enhancements and alternate modes for PCs called &amp;quot;Endorfun&amp;quot; in 1995 in the U.S and Europe.Japanese developers seemed to like the concept and got permission to make something like it based on the original principals of Endorfun for the obscure Satellaview (or BS-X) and then later as a standalone release for the Super Famicom, where the game was called BS Cu-On-Pa and Cu-On-Pa, respectively. It would also get released later for Playstation.Published by T&amp;E Soft for the SFC late in 1996, Cu-On-Pa was also fan-translated sometime later for the emulation community, though the game comes with a rather straightforward tutorial and the game is very easy to understand, but difficult to master. This game is difficult to describe and in a league of its own.You play as a three-dimensional cube that must destroy all the &amp;quot;Life Panels&amp;quot; on a level. To do so, you have to rotate your cube and roll over the colored squares on the transparent field. Panels come in a variety of colors and the main way to elimate them is by having the color on the top of the cube match the color of the tile beneath you.The other way is for more skilled players and comes in the form of &amp;quot;Lightning Panels&amp;quot;, which are generated when you destroy panels other than Life Panels. Destroy enough of them and you'll have lots of them. Then go and destroy a life panel! What will happen is, all lightning panels will explode that match the color of the life panel you rolled over. Moreover, the explosion spreads and detonates other tiles in the vicinity, which can spread and create a chain reaction. It's up to you how you wish to rack up points, either by time, chains, or both.Ken Kojima was the music composer.</resource>

Like the rest of the series, it is a competitive multiplayer board game that plays similarly to Milton Bradley's The Game of Life, known as the Jinsei Game in Japan.

Unlike Daibakushou Jinsei Gekijou, which carried the player from infancy to retirement age, Dokidoki Seishun Hen focuses entirely on highschoolers. The goal is to learn as much knowledge as possible, earn plenty of money and make their teachers and parents happy. Instead of having a target square to reach in order to continue onto the next phase of the game, the players simply move around a circular board experiencing events every turn as weeks and months pass, with new elements and new areas of the board added after certain dates.</resource>

Unfortunately in doing so he gets killed himself. Now four other characters emerge, each claiming to be the real hero. The story starts you off with Superman, then Steel, the Eradicator, the Cyborg, and Superboy. Each character has slightly varied moves so different strategies apply when playing as them.

The gameplay is basically that of a standard beat-em-up, with the punches, throws and specials moves.</resource>

The game is viewed from above and played up and down the pitch, without the left-to-right option of Goal. Matches can be between 2 or 20 minutes, and the scanner which shows player positions on the rest of the pitch can be moved, resized or disabled. The method of triggering aftertouch onto a pass can be chosen as well.

The game features a variety of tournaments, including the full World Cup and its qualifying rounds, and the European Championships, or individual matches, as well as being able to configure a league or cup tournament ot your own specification. Only international teams are included, although their names can be customised. Unlike most soccer games of the time, player ethnicities are accurately depicted.</resource>

It appears that your mother died just after giving birth to you, and your father took you on a long journey when you were a little baby, and all you know is that he was searching for something. Now you are six years old, and Lord Papas brings you to your home village. After some time, you learn that His Highness Prince Henry was kidnapped by bandits. Your father attempts to rescue him, and during this action you discover that perhaps your mother is still alive... The game follows the story of Papas' son, and this story is stretched over years, as the hero grows and becomes a man of courage and virtue. During the game, the hero will discover the truth about his mother, and will have to make some crucial decisions, such as which girl to marry (the decisions affect the course of the game and its ending).

&amp;quot;Dragon Quest V&amp;quot; is a party RPG with turn-based combat, and battles viewed from 1st person perspective, just like all its predecessors. Your party roams about the world, fighting random enemies, performing quests, and defeating bosses. The novelty is in the game's unusual story, which spans almost a lifetime of the hero. 

&amp;quot;Dragon Quest V&amp;quot; was not available outside of Japan until 2009, when the DS version was released in the United States.

Its story focuses on a war between the Earth Federation Army and the Unification Forces Army, with the player taking on the role of the latter. Like its predecessor and the series's inspiration Nectaris, the game uses a grid system comprised of hexagons. The player can customize their active mechas before each battle, and can get debriefed before moving to that map to hear the victory conditions and other tactical data. The game uses a rough rock-scissors-paper system for unit strengths, with some characters working better in specific roles.</resource>

It's presented in a 3D isometric view with very colourful graphics. The game is based upon solving puzzles to progress to the next dungeon. In the game you play the son of the hero in the first game; Shadax. Shadax has been kidnapped by an evil witch and it is up to you to rescue him. There is a wide range of weapons and powerful magic spells you can use throughout your quest, some of which are required to solve puzzles. In Equinox, you can travel on the aboveground map as well as the underworld, although all the action except for some battles will still happen underground. If you have played any of Zelda games before, much of the game will be familiar: you must search for keys, blasting or avoiding monsters, solving physical puzzles on your way to meeting end-level guardian that you must defeat to progress.</resource>

The young boy in your family likes to target you for his mischief.  He sets up volleys of tennis balls and lets loose a vacuum cleaner on you which you must avoid.  The cat and other obstacles await you in your house while you collect bones for power.   

After all the trouble you cause in the home, you are sent to Obedience School and you have to run a gauntlet of gung-ho instructors and ferocious Dobermans in the heavily-guarded compound.  If successful at escaping, you reach a forest filled with wild animals.

You can use flips, spins and barks to make your way through the various obstacles.  A special ball when found will trigger a bonus game that will also teach you how to fetch.</resource>

The wrestlers are all taken from the Zen-Nippon Joshi Pro Wrestling (&amp;quot;All Japan Women's Pro Wrestling&amp;quot;) circuit, an exclusively female wrestling promotion that lasted for many years in Japan.

As with prior Fire Pro Wrestling games, the mechanics behind the moves, pins and submissions rely more on timing and rhythm than button-mashing. Each bout is depicted with an isometric perspective, and various configurations of single-player and two-player controls are available for one-on-one matches and tag teams. The game features 18 pre-generated wrestlers and six create-a-wrestler slots.</resource>

The game retains the basic gameplay and the story of the original. Some scenes and dialogues were added (for example, the intro features a detailed account of what happened in different kingdoms after the Ornic invasion, which was absent in the original version). The battle system remains the same, but the player has more options to customize the party AI. Also, instead of choosing locations from a menu and being able to view the world map only before major battles, the player is actually navigating the world map now, physically moving to the dots that represent locations. 

The remake features new musical compositions and sound effects, as well as more detailed 16-bit graphics.</resource>

Defenceless against the Demon's magic, you succumb to his powers, leaving the your Master to fight the Demon King alone. Your master falls in combat, dying. But, with his last breath, he summons the Wizard Mage. The Demon King fearing defeat, escapes to the future. Tormented, the young samurai seeks the teachings of the Wizard Mage in the ways of magic. Boiled with revenge and armed with a magical sword, the young samurai follows the Demon King into the future and the unknown...&amp;quot;

The First Samurai is a platform action game very much similar to other platform games, but with a medieval oriental touch to it in addition to various unique features.

Arriving in the new unknown land, you are defenceless hence your fists and kicks. But as you journey forth, you'll find your trusty magical sword as well as throwing weapons such as knives and axes. With your martial art skills, your enemy best beware with those sudden moves that may prove fatal!

The First Samurai offers a wide array of weapons, special items and other objects. Combat is usually melee, either relying on your punch or kicks or using the magical sword to slash some pretty skillful blows in whatever direction possible.

Monsters are forever regenerating but food for health is plentiful. It actually takes an effort to be killed...</resource>

To defend yourself, you shoot enemies with your gun and also use various objects (such as stones) to harm or to distract them.

It was created to raise awareness about &amp;quot;crunch time&amp;quot; in game development, a practice in some companies when employees are expected to put in a large amount of (unpaid) overtime hours to get the game done in a proposed time. Devolver Digital donated 100% of their profits from sales to Take This, an organization that raises awareness and aims to combat mental health issues.

At the start of the game Fork Parker feels threatened by the rise of a new publisher, Cash Cow Games. They released Loot Box: The Game where only one in twenty downloads contains the actual game and they bought their own e-sports team. Parker decides it is time to catch up with them through crunch time. The player controls Parker in the office with mechanics typical of time management titles. He needs to bring employees caffeine to keep them awake, serve hamburgers at their desks, whip them into working, literally, using a bat, or resuscitate them using a dose of electricity when they pass out. The game takes place on a single, fixed screen and most actions are tied to moving to one of the four stations near the top of the screen, for instance to get coffee. An icon of an employee's head shows the current mood / status and Parker needs to move quickly to the correct station to remedy it. There is also a pink pet pig Pork running around and it needs to be avoided. When Parker comes in contact with it, he shakes it for a long time and B needs to be tapped repeatedly to make him let go.</resource>

The game features a number of pachinko games for which the player must suss out a winning strategy and score big.

Ganso Pachinko Ou is reliant on a special pachinko controller peripheral manufactured by SunSoft that was sold separately. The game will only start when this controller is plugged into the second SFC port.</resource>

Like its predecessor, the game features a number of simulations of real-life pachinko machines that the player can practice on and study to prepare them for the real thing. These machines were produced by Sankyo, a manufacturer of pachinko machines in Japan, and the game is named for them.</resource>

Dokapon Kingdoms IV: Legend of Heroes&amp;quot;) is a mix of an RPG and a multiplayer board game. Players move their heroes around the board, gaining levels and finding equipment, and eventually saving a kingdom from encroaching monsters. The goal is to beat the target monsters before the other players.

Though the game includes a &amp;quot;IV&amp;quot; in its title, this actually refers to the number of players the game can support rather than being the fourth in the series. Kessen! Dokapon Okukoku IV is in actuality the very first Dokapon game. It was followed by Dokapon 3-2-1 and Dokapon Gaiden on the Super Famicom and BS Dokapon Gaiden: Hono no Audition for the Super Famicom's Satellaview.</resource>

The three Vikings will have to combine their unique skills to defeat Tomator, as well as a vast array of aliens, robots, giant snails, big lizards and more.

The Lost Vikings is a side-scrolling platform puzzle game with a twist. Instead of one character who can jump, run, shoot, collect items, flip switches and so on, there are three different characters, each with his own skills. Eric the Swift can jump, run and bash through walls with his tough helmet. Olaf the Stout has a shield which can block attacks, function as an air glider or as a step to stand on. Baleog the Fierce can shoot things with his arrows (including switches) or kill things with his sword. The player has to use the three Vikings as a team if he wants to get past the increasingly difficult levels and puzzles.

The player controls one Viking at a time, but can switch between them at any point. The Vikings have limited space in their inventory which they can use to keep various items. Each Viking has three health points, and if he loses them all from confrontations with dangers, he dies (some threats kill instantly), and the level must be restarted.</resource>

It is the sequel to The Shinri Game: Akuma no Kokoroji. The Shinri Game 2 dropped the heaven/hell aesthetic of its predecessor and went with basic animated shapes and colors akin to music visualizers of the era as well as a more serene soundtrack.

The Shinri Game series offers various questions that test the player's judgment and personality rather than their general knowledge. The word &amp;quot;shinri&amp;quot; is Japanese for &amp;quot;psychology&amp;quot;. It would go on to have many more sequels, most of which were exclusive to the PlayStation.</resource>

You will fight Klingons, deal with repairs, and find yourself in all manner of dangerous situations, but try to stay within Starfleet directives.

The game is viewed from the bridge of your vessel (there are 5 different ones in total), with polygons used to display the action. Information on the world situation at the time of the game is supplied within the game. There are quick missions bringing scenes from Star Trek movies to life.

To date, the only version of the game to be released outside of Japan was the Sega Saturn port of Winning Post EX, released in North America as Winning Post. All of the other games have only been released in Japan.
The goal is to take a stable of horses, hire professional jockeys to ride them and raise money from winning and betting on races. Winning Post is a very dense management game, like much of Koei's early output.</resource>
