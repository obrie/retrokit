You are an astronaut aboard the Discovery and need to repair its systems before it crashes into Jupiter's moon, Io. Time is limited so do not dawdle or the Discovery will be destroyed.

You move the reticule over a trouble spot and press the A button to begin repairs. You must then select a path for the power to run so it powers all the components on that circuit board then move on. 

If the floating ring touches a component while you are at it or you create a feedback loop, you will damage the component and will need to repair it  before you can continue, costing you time.

Sometimes, you will need to return to a circuit to repair a component then restart it.</resource>

    <resource id="1e11e5910a5072bcf928b25230167bf7e821fd3d" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">The Activision Decathlon is a series of Olympic games similar to the Epyx games series. Up to four players can compete in the ten different events of a real-life decathlon, either in sequence or individually. Included are the 100-meter dash, long jump, shot put, high jump, 400-meter race, 110-meter hurdles, discus throw, pole vault, javelin throw, and 1500-meter race. 

The flat running events involve simple joystick waggling, which must be balanced with accurately-timed button presses to clear the hurdles - hitting them or breaking stride causes a loss of momentum and thus time. For jumping and throwing events, you must build momentum by waggling and then press the button to throw or jump at what you feel is the appropriate moment.

For each event, points are earned based on how well you do (this can be based on your running time, or how far you throw the javelin or discus, etc...), and the player with the most points at the end of the decathlon wins the gold medal.</resource>

To reach Alcazar you are travelling through a countryside of fortresses and you need to collect several items that you can find along the way.
Once you enter the Alcazar fortress you have to search for the crown.

The strategy map gives you an overview of the countryside, it's fortresses and your location in it.
What perils lurk in these mysterious castles? Which path is 
quick and safe?
The Alcazar castle is three stories high, all other castles have only two stories. To enter a castle you just have to follow the path.
Each castle has it's own sought-after objects and these objects are always guarded by the castles main demon.
Objects to look for are for example: a rope, a gun, raw meat, water or a raft. Collect them and use them properly to master
the legendary Alcazar fortress.

The game gives you clues and tells,  for example, which monsters are nearby. Some monsters are really hard to kill.

The game can be played at four difficulty levels.</resource>

Players take turns firing at each other; on each turn you have a limited amount of time in which the barrel angle and powder level can be set in order to control the direction and distance of the shot. When deciding on your shot, you will need to take the current conditions into account, which includes wind speed/direction and any mountains that may get in your way. Successfully destroying your opponents gun will earn you a point, and the first player to reach the set number of points wins the game. There are multiple skill levels available which set the amount of time you have to make a shot.</resource>

To complete a sector, you need to destroy fifteen white flying saucers. After all saucers are destroyed, the sector sentinel passes by which can be destroyed for extra points. Each even number sector up until sector 16 will add a new type of enemy to deal with.

The first game is &amp;quot;Follow The Leader&amp;quot; where a pattern is repeated using a 4-color circle. By keeping track of either the tones generated or the colors flashing, the player can copy the sequence to continue. Higher difficulties increase speed and allow only tone identification of sequences. Additionally it keeps track of your best number of correct identifications in a row.

The second game is &amp;quot;Clef Climber&amp;quot; where the player is given a tone that corresponds to a certain musical note and must match the note being played. Lower difficulties provide a constant tone to refer to and visual help on the note being used. Higher difficulties provide a single playing of the tone and no visual help.</resource>

As you race through the treacherous and ever changing roadways, the numerous enemy cars will be trying to bump you off the road. You need to make sure you bump the cars out of the way before you get bumped and crash into the sides yourself! Your car also has the ability to jump quite high if you have enough speed. This is useful to jump over enemy cars if there are too many in the way, and must also be used to jump gaps in the roadway and other highway obstacles. As the levels progress, the road becomes narrower with more obstacles in the way, and the other cars increase in number and in aggressiveness.</resource>

To properly make a hamburger you must assemble all of the ingredients together, dropping them from higher up onto the the burger area below. To actually do this you have to let Chef Pepper step all over the burger ingredients. As soon as an ingredient (a piece of lettuce for instance) has been stepped on, it will fall to the next level below. Falling food will squish any enemy following you and will also&amp;quot;bump&amp;quot; any other ingredient bellow it farther down. Also, as an emergency defense against the enemy food, you can collect pepper shakers which will allow you to puff out a small pepper cloud which will momentarily stun enemies, allowing you to walk past them.

Higher levels result in new level design, faster enemies and more ingredients to assemble.

The PlayStation 2 version is a port of the original arcade game and comes with a soundtrack disc, a DVD, a guide book and some other bonuses.</resource>

The customers would play it while waiting in the lobby. The game was made by the company Nuvatec. It was never sold commercially and could only be found exclusively in cat heavy equipment dealerships. The game consists of a bulldozer that rides around and pushes dirt. Each dirt pile represents a &amp;quot;job&amp;quot;. To keep from exploding you have to send in oil samples to the cat dealership ,then you will be told if the oil is good or bad. If you fail to do this occasionally your oil will go bad and your bulldozer will explode. To clean the oil you have to go to the cat dealership. The goal of the game is to make the most money from finishing &amp;quot;jobs&amp;quot;.

The game consists of several different screens: when beginning and between fights you will see a view of the path that leads to the monastery. Walking along the path, you will encounter numerous enemies. When fighting, the view switches to a close up of your current location. By pressing the joystick button and moving the joystick in one of four directions you can perform various kicks, punches, and blocks. The enemies you encounter are varied, and some can only be defeated by certain moves. The path you walk along will occasionally split up into two or more choices; when this happens, only one choice is correct and the others are dead ends. If you choose incorrectly, you'll have to back track a bit and try again. Beginning as a white belt, you will slowly increase in rank as you win fights. By the time you reach the monastery you need to earn black belt status in order to defeat the deadly ninjas inside! Your quest must be completed within a time limit, or the game is over. Walking off of the path or losing fights will also cause you to lose even more time.</resource>

This task is not easy, as en route you will face heavy opposition forces. Fortunately, you won't be a sitting bomber in the air. Your aircraft is equipped with machine guns (left and right) with unlimited rounds of fire power, so fire at will as the enemy approaches.

When the time comes, you will have to bomb the target manually. So, get ready to unload the cargo and give them hell!</resource>

Donkey Kong is a platform-action game that has Mario scale four different industrial themed levels (construction zone, cement factory, an elevator-themed level, and removing rivets from girders) in an attempt to save the damsel in distress, Pauline, from the big ape before the timer runs out.  Once the rivets are removed from the final level, Donkey Kong falls, and the two lovers are reunited.  From there, the levels start over at a higher difficulty.

Along the way, Mario must dodge a constant stream of barrels, &amp;quot;living&amp;quot; fireballs, and spring-weights.  Although not as powerful as in other future games, Mario can find a hammer which allows him to destroy the barrels and fireballs for a limited amount of time.  Additionally, Mario can also find Pauline's hat, purse and umbrella for additional bonus points.

Donkey Kong is also notable for being one of the first complete narratives in video game form, told through simplistic cut scenes that advance the story.  It should also be noted that in versions of the game for early 1980's consoles, Donkey Kong only used 2-3 of the original levels, with the cement factory usually omitted.</resource>

Donkey Kong Jr. was originally released in the arcades in 1982 as a sequel to Donkey Kong.  In this game, Mario plays the antagonist, finally having captured Donkey Kong, and has put the ape in a locked cage.  As Donkey Kong Jr., players will have to make their way through four different levels (Vines, Springboard, Chains and Mario's Hideout) in an attempt to find keys to free the little monkey's Father.

Along the way, Mario will send out Snapjaws, swooping purple birds, and electric sparks in an attempt to stop Junior.  Junior can defend himself by dropping fruit found around the levels on the heads of his foes.  The more foes a piece of fruit hits in a falling sequence, the higher bonus points can be scored.

Junior can also avoid enemies more easily by grabbing hold of two chains or vines at a time to climb away faster, or by jumping over his foes.  However, any long fall or falling into the water on certain levels will mean the loss of a life for Junior.

In the final cut scene, Junior will free Donkey Kong and both will escape after giving Mario the boot.  Once all four levels are cleared, the game levels will start over at a higher difficulty.

Like the original Donkey Kong, the earlier 1980's console versions do not have all of the levels and animations from the arcade.</resource>

Beware though as Boss Hog and his police force are trying to chase you. The Duke boys are as usual on the side of right in this scenario and it's Jeremiah who has orchestrated things to put them on the wrong side of the law.

The gameplay is a top-down view of your vehicle heading down a path vertically across the screen. Also on the screen is your speedometer, a bonus timer (faster times mean more points!) and a gear shift. The General Lee itself has gears 1 through 4 and higher gears mean MORE SPEED. As for obstacles, the path ahead of you is full of hills and oil slicks making it difficult to catch up to (and pass) your prey.

Successful completion of levels results in faster chases and more obstacles on the road. Also an increased &amp;quot;Boss Hogg&amp;quot; presence.</resource>

You find yourself in a huge maze being watched by the Mindmaster. He is testing your intelligence, reflexes, agility, etc. The honor of you and the entire human race depends on how fast you can solve the Mindmaster's puzzles and six mazes.

You begin in maze one. You must go through the maze and find colored, shaped pegs then find the correct shaped hole to put it in. As if that wasn't bad enough, there is an Alien Stalker wandering the maze and if he touches you, you lose one chance. You can tell how close he is by the beeping sound. The faster and higher it is, the closer he is. He cannot pass through walls or doors. Also, starting with maze two, there are force fields in the maze that if you touch them, you lose one chance. There are also one-way doors starting with maze four. If you go through one and turn around, there is no way back. You can never go through a door when backing up.

There are also skill tests in mazes one through five that you can complete for points. They are as follows:
Maze 1: Agility - Move your cursor from side to side to avoid the falling bricks. The four collisions and the test is done.
Maze 2: Reflexes - Press your joystick in the direction of the arrow
Maze 3: Recall - Watch the sequence of flashing arrows then move your joystick in the same sequence
Maze 4: Dexterity - The same as the agility test except the test is over if you get hit once
Maze 5: Coordination - Land a lander onto a platform without using much fuel. You get up to five attempts.

You start each maze with sixty points and every few seconds a point is deducted. The total score for each maze is the score you got on the skill test plus whatever is left of the beginning sixty when you exit the maze. If you lose all your chances or finish maze six, you will get your final score and the Mindmaster's impression of you and the human race.

Each level is a different stage in evolution with it's own unique goals. The first level is the amoeba stage where you need to eat all the DNA on the screen while avoiding the spores, microbes, and antibodies that are trying to stop you. The second level is the tadpole stage. The tadpole needs to eat three flies to move on to the next stage while avoiding the very hungry fish. Next is the rodent stage, where you need to eat five blocks of cheese while avoiding the snakes. In level four you need to guide a beaver across alligator infested waters to retrieve sticks and build a dam. The fifth level is the gorilla stage, where your gorilla has to use coconuts to fight off monkeys that are trying to steel its orange stash. And finally is the human stage, where you have to use a laser gun to fight off mutants that are trying to take over the earth.</resource>

Incorrect fractions can be knocked down for scoring points, but this leaves holes in the floors. When the player doesn't manage to jump over these and falls down far enough or several times, the game will end. There is also a time limit to look out for, if the clock reaches zero the Fraction Elevator of the current floor cannot be reached, and the player has to jump down a floor to be able to try again.</resource>

The road is full of cars and trucks, at variable speeds. The river water itself is fatal, as are the snakes which hover within on later levels.

The player moves left and right to aim at an alien, then shoots a bullet up the screen, and the alien it hits is killed.

At set intervals an enemy will move down the screen towards you, escorting a bomber, which is a moment of high danger. Clear a wave and another is generated.</resource>

    <resource id="1e42c085e6b172c3184d3cf541ed8a604d08a3b1" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Gorf is a game similar to Space Invaders, alien vessels approach closer and closer in their threatening row formation.

The game itself consists of four levels:

1. The first level has you behind a defensive shield, defending against an alien attack. The level is a top-down view, with your ship &amp; shield on one side and the aliens on the other side;

The second level is similar to the first, only your defensive shield is gone, and the enemies tend to swoop down over the level as opposed to those row formations. Bonus ships also tend to appear in this level;

The third level is a change, and has you entering hyperspace. Your only goal is to survive to the end of your journey. The viewpoint switches from a top-down view to a behind-the-ship view and in effect you are heading &amp;quot;towards&amp;quot; your destination. Alien vessels flying in circular formation try to stop you;

The fourth and final level is similar to the first again, with some key differences. You do not fight a wave of enemies, but a single one. A mothership with a glowing weak spot. Hitting the weak spot will instantly destroy it. The mothership also has that same shield that was yours in the first level.

Finishing the game increases your rank and starts the game over at level 1 with a faster game speed for more challenge.</resource>

You will need to fly your spaceship to each of the nine planets and then clear three stages of enemies to rid that planet of the Gyrusians. You start the game with a single canon, and can gain a double canon after shooting a power up satelite. After clearing each planet, there is another bonus stage where additional weapons and bonus points can be collected. Gyruss is an arcade action shooter, however instead of piloting your spaceship horizontally or vertically, you move in a circle around the perimeter of the screen. The NES version of Gyruss adds to the original arcade version additional music, additional weapons, new enemies, and a large boss at the end of each level.</resource>

Volcanic activity has trapped numerous miners, and it is your job to save them. As Roderick Hero, you need to make your way through the dangerous mineshaft avoiding the dangerous creatures and lava, and find out where the miners are located before you run out of energy. To help on your mission, Roderick Hero has several useful types of equipment. A prop pack will allow you to hover and fly around the mineshaft and (hopefully) avoid the many dangers within. Your helmet features a short range microlaser beam which can be used to destroy the bats, spiders, snakes, and other creatures you'll encounter in the mines. From time to time, your path through the mine may be blocked by stone or lava walls. You begin each mission with six sticks of dynamite which can be used to destroy these obstacles (be careful you don't blow yourself up, though!) If you run out of dynamite, your laser beam can also be used to destroy the walls, though this will take longer and use up more energy. As the levels progress, the mine shaft will become longer and more maze-like, creatures will more frequently block the path, and lava walls and pools will appear which are dangerous to the touch.</resource>

The user can select to play either to a certain score or for a certain amount of time.  When on offense, the player can rotate to keep away from his rival, take a shot from a distance or move in to the basket for special up-close slam-dunks.  When on defense, you can try to take your rival's ball or jump up to block a shot.  Particularly good set-ups get a slow-motion replay.  You can even smash the glass on the backboard, which will send an irate janitor onto the court to clean up the mess.</resource>

    <resource id="1bbed1b107a010fa5a7615f668670761d7e8f7a4" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Jungle Hunt offers four unique adventure experiences, which repeat with greater difficulty once all four have been survived.  If you don't survive these adventures, you will not only lose your own life but that of the lovely Penelope, who has been captured by cannibals!

The first part challenges your Tarzan skills - can you swing on the vines without plummeting to your doom?  The second part pits you against a whole bunch of nasty crocodiles in a mighty river.  Fortunately, you have a knife to fight back with.  Don't forget to go up for air!  In the third part, you face a battle against oncoming boulders of varying sizes and physics.  Once you've cleared all these treacherous hazards, you still must confront the dreaded cannibal, who is armed with a wicked spear.  Can you get past him and save the lovely Penelope?

Gameplay involves much strategic jumping and knife play (in the river/crocodile phase).  The view is always a side view, much like Pitfall! and later platform games.</resource>

You play the part of Officer Keystone Kelly, sent in to capture Harry. Harry is trapped in a four story mall, and is running as fast as he can to reach the exit at the top. Your job is to catch up to him and send him to prison. You will need to use either the escalators at the end of each floor, or the elevator in the middle to go from floor to floor. The escalators may be further away, but the elevator moves pretty slowly so you will need to decide which route will be faster in getting you closer to your goal. If Harry can make it to the top before you catch him, you will have to retry that level. Harry has no intention of letting you catch him easily, and is hurling everything he can find in an attempt to slow you down. Shopping carts, bouncing balls, biplanes, and more will all be flying past on the screen and will either slow you down or send you back to the beginning if you get hit. As the levels progress, Harry will run faster and faster, and more objects will be tossed your way to duck and jump over.</resource>

    <resource id="b1b0f10e0ad18b37461005f6a83990da401e6fbc" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">An action game in the same style as Pac-Man but very very different. Players control a ladybug who must venture around different mazes collecting all of the food pellet &amp;quot;x&amp;quot;'s. In addition to there being regular lines of wall in the maze, there are also several rotating doors that can be used to trap enemies and escape. In fact these rotating doors are the key to survival in this game.  In the center of each maze is a different enemy insect hive that will spawn out enemy creatures. An new enemy creature is spawned every time the border around the screen makes a complete &amp;quot;lap&amp;quot;. Timers for the border vary upon the level, so later levels will generate new enemies faster, thus progression through the game brings smarter, faster and more quickly spawning enemies.

In addition to the collection of X's, each maze also contains a variety of powerups that come in three types: Poison, Letters and Hearts. Poison is deadly both to the player and the enemy. If the player is able to lure and enemy creature into a poison powerup, it will die and be removed from gameplay. Letters and hearts are powerups with multiple conditions: Collected at the right time they will add letters that will eventually spell words providing bonuses. However collected during the the improper time will only earn the player a few points. For most of the gameplay the colour of all powerups (except skulls which are unaffected) will be blue. But every few seconds it will cycle through yellow and then red colours. Grabbing a letter when flashing the colour will add it to that colour's word. The red word is &amp;quot;SPECIAL&amp;quot; and the yellow word is &amp;quot;EXTRA&amp;quot;. Spelling the word, EXTRA gains the player an extra life, and spelling the word, SPECIAL brings the player to a special bonus round.

Hearts are best used as blue powerups as they will act as multipliers for the X's being picked up, first as 2x, then as 3x and finally as 5x. Multipliers are lost when the player dies, but letter powerups are not.</resource>

Your goal is to guide a plane from the runway to a docking station. To do this, there are several screens you need to get past. In the first area, you need to destroy a rocket which will open the gate to the next area. Enemy balloons and city terrain all get in your way! Once you've opened the gate and flown through, you will enter a maze made of pipes. There are no enemies trying to destroy you here, but be careful not to crash into the walls! Bonus points can be earned by staying in the maze for longer periods of time or by flying faster. Once you near the end of the pipe maze, the docking station will be in sight. There will now be several twinkle monsters, green drops, and bouncing balls in the way, all of which destroy your plane on contact. If you successfully reach the goal, the game will repeat at a more difficult skill level.</resource>

In the equation one number is missing, you 'll have to find the right number. This game is aimed at young children to help them learn arithmetic problem solving or playing with numbers.

Some monkeys are minding their own business when they see a number missing from their arithmetic problem. Who took it? Another monkey, a crab? And where could it be? The only way to find that out is to go looking for it.

Guide your monkey across the screen and up and down platform levels. Watch out for the crab! If its claws bite you, you lose a monkey. Jump up and pull down shades to find the missing number. When you find it, catch the number bar. Then send it up to your helper monkey. Find three missing numbers and earn bonus points!</resource>

But beware, the catacombs are a large maze inhabited by monsters. Bouncing and rolling skulls, dancing spiders, disappearing and re-appearing chains and tons of fire await you. You'll have to find many keys and unlock doors in order to reach your goal. Panama Joe can jump and climb ladders, but doesn't have much to offer in terms of combat. That's why the monsters in the game should be avoided: a collision with an enemy leads to a premature death.</resource>

You begin your mission in space where you must avoid deadly aurora flares, photon torches and space bullets from the sun in this quadrant. From time to time you will see a moon pass by, and by flying near it you can descend to the surface. As you sweep along the surface, you will see stranded miners which need to be rescued by flying over them. Also on the moons surface are various obstacles which must be avoided or destroyed, such as towers and lunar satellites as well as alien surface destroyers. Should you survive and rescue six miners (the maximum your ship can carry), then you may take off from the surface by using the accelerator rings. There are several different types of moons found in this quadrant, each with a different level of difficulty. To help out, your ship is equipped with photon torpedoes and shields (though you will lose points while using the shield).</resource>

Each scene takes place in a different location with a different perspective. First you will race through the desert with a 3-D behind the bike point of view. Rocks, cacti, scorpions, and other obstacles should be avoided or you'll crash and lose valuable time. Next you'll race a winding path uphill through the woods. This section has a top down view, and you'll lose time if you wander off the track or crash into obstacles. The final segment of the race takes place on the beach with a side scrolling point of view. Various obstacles and other racers will all get in your way here! If you crash too many times, or take too long the game will be over.</resource>

Your goal is to locate and retrieve the crown, then make it to the top of the mine alive! There are several steps that need to be completed before you can retrieve the crown. First you need to collect enough diamonds to earn 1,000 points. After you have enough points, you need to locate the flame spirit which is hidden somewhere within the mine. Since the mine is rather dark, you carry a flashlight with you which can be used to locate objects (such as treasure chests full of diamonds and the flame spirit.) Once you have the flame spirit, you need to find the entrance to the temple the crown is in. Offer the flame spirit to the skull spirit guarding the entrance, and you can get in and take the crown. Once you have the crown, you need to make it to the top of the mine before time runs out. To make this task more challenging, numerous cave bats fly around which can steal the crown. If this happens, you need to begin again! At the very bottom of the mine is a deadly spider; if you're not careful while exploring this region of the mine, you could become caught in it's web and be eaten. Each level has a time limit, and the more levels you complete the shorter the time limit becomes!</resource>

However, there are numerous bad guys out to get him! Mr. Do can defend himself from the badguys in two ways: first he can push the apples located throughout the playfield on top of the enemies and crush them. Secondly, Mr. Do is armed with a power ball. This can be thrown to destroy an enemy. Mr. Do has only one power ball, though, so he will need to wait for it to return to him before it can be used again. From time to time an alpha monster will appear on the screen bearing one of the letters in EXTRA. If you use the power ball to destroy an alpha monster you earn that letter; when you've earned the complete word EXTRA you receive an extra life. When you successfully collect all of the cherries, you will move on to the next, more difficult level.

The mobile version of the game includes the original arcade version, as well as an enhanced mode with new levels, power-ups and graphics.</resource>

Each city has a bubble shield that can sustain one hit; another hit to an unshielded city will destroy it.

Players control a ship that can fire lasers horizontally and drop bomb vertically. The ship is also equipped with an energy beam that can absorb energy from energy tanks, and can also use that energy to create temporary shields around unprotected cities. The ship can also sustain up to 10 blows in each round. If all 4 cities are destroyed or the ship takes 10 hits in a round, the game ends.

You control a spaceship and shoot down the enemy &amp;quot;Droid&amp;quot; ships that attack you.  Your ship must survive Droid-dropped mines too--but you can shoot them too.  The last ship of the Droid flights goes into a spiraling pattern.

There is no end to this game.  Rather, it is a game in which you try to get the highest score, or complete the highest number of levels.

You control a small triangle that is your ship.  The ship can turn, move forward (with thrusters) and fire.  Movement is one of the games challenges; once the ship is moving, it can only be slowed by turning the nose in the opposite direction and use the thrusters.  While doing that, the ship is unable to fire toward anything it is in motion toward.

Bouncing also comes into play during movement.  When the ship hits the side of the screen, a wall of force appears, and the ship bounces.  You don't have control over where the ship bounces, and must take time to regain control, before you run into an enemy ship and die.</resource>

The object of Pepper II is simple enough, all you do is zip closed sections of the maze and they will become filled with color. Zip in all the sections of the maze and it's complete. However if you back track you might unzip your path, so be careful! Each stage has four mazes you must complete to move on, but you can move from maze to maze by using the exits located at the top, bottom and sides of the screen. And don't forget about the bad guys trying to take you out all the while. If one touches you you're toast! You can fight back by zipping sections of the maze closed that contain power-ups that will make you invincible for a short time or clear all the screen of the baddies.  The game keeps getting harder as you progress to higher stages.</resource>

Your goal is to earn as much money as possible by winning races in the Grand Circuit which consists of a race on each of the six tracks; each time a race is completed, you'll earn money based on how you placed and the number of laps completed before moving on. While you are racing, keep an eye on your tires and fuel; if your tires become too worn (causing a blowout) or you run out of fuel, the game will be over. To prevent this from happening, you'll need to make a pitstop. Here you control the pit crew and can replace tires and refuel. While in the pit the race is still going on, of course, so repairs need to be made as quickly as possible to get back into the race without losing too much ground. Several game options are available to control the level of difficulty and the number of laps. In addition to the Grand Circuit which is the full race, you can also practice a track in a single race or enter the mini circuit which consists of three races.</resource>

Once again your goal is to change multicolored blocks to a target color, but now you must make sure all three visible sides of the blocks match the target color. You control Q*Bert on the playfield of blocks; Q*Bert changes the colors by jumping to a block which will cause it to rotate in the direction of his jump. Unlike the original game, you don't need to change the colors of the whole playfield, but rather need to form straight line(s) of the target colors, and when you do you can move on to the next round. Of course, to make this task more challenging are a variety of creatures (including a giant rat!) that chase you around the playfield. Each creature is a different color, and if it lands on a block where the top face is the same color then the creature falls off of the playfield, but if Q*Bert gets caught by a creature then a life is lost! As the game progresses, more creatures chase Q*Bert and additional colors are added to the playfield making it tougher to find the target color. There are no longer any discs on the sides of the playfield to carry you to safety, so make sure you don't jump off the edge! To help out, a green ball may appear from time to time; if you catch this, all the enemies become frozen temporarily.</resource>

Your goal is to find the vault which is hidden somewhere within and return with the treasure that is inside. You begin your quest outside the temple; climb your way up the side of the temple in order to get inside. Poisonous snakes and deadly lightning bolts will block your progress here. Once inside the temple, you have a limited air supply so you need to explore quickly. Hidden in various rooms of the temple are numerous keys which are needed to unlock the vault. The keys and some other useful items are hidden in secret rooms which you need to locate by using your trusty pick axe or the flasks of acid you carry. To help figure out which rooms may contain hidden objects, you carry a geiger counter with you;  the higher the reading, the closer you are to something of interest! The rooms you'll be exploring are guarded by snakes, spiders, and even mummies! To deal with these enemies you carry a gun, and you can also use the acid flasks against them (ammo is limited, so use it wisely). If you are successful in your mission, you may receive a secret code which can be used to begin the game at later levels. Good luck!</resource>

You fly a jet up a river in an attempt to destroy bridges which are vital to the enemy. The river is heavily guarded, however, with balloons, ships, choppers, and enemy aircraft trying to stop you. Along the way you will need to fly over fuel stations to refuel your jet and keep flying.

The plane is armed with a cannon with unlimited ammo. It can be used to destroy the enemy vehicles and bridges, but a careless player can accidentally destroy a fuel station. Colliding with the riverbanks or with the enemy aircraft destroys your plane and makes you lose a life.</resource>

Gameplay takes place on several different screens which have different objectives. First you will need to make your way through Sherwood Forest; numerous henchman are hiding here, so use your arrows to shoot them. Surviving the forest, the next section takes place outside of the castle; naturally, numerous henchman guard the castle gate. While dodging incoming arrows, you need to shoot enough of the henchman to cause the gate to open. Once it opens, you can enter the castle for the final scene. Inside the castle you will be able to find Maid Marian behind one of the many doors, and gold behind another. The rest of the doors have henchman hiding behind them, but if you can find the Maid Marian or the gold then you win this round and the game repeats at a tougher skill level.</resource>

    <resource id="25d28ac18aaf94b30c7ccd6f42b39cab224ffa1f" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Your player is a mountain climber who must avoid cavemen, dinosaurs and pterodactyls as he climbs up the cliff-sides. Your goal in each level is to climb up and reach a mystical bird with great plumage, while staying one step above the bonus timer which determines how long you may stay on each level. The mountain climber has only one ability; to shoot rope at 45 degree angles which he may then climb up to other platforms. His other action is a stun beam which will allow him to walk past enemies who get too close; but will only work horizontally from him. As for power-ups, on each level is (usually 2) a flashing diamond power-up which will make him invincible and allow him to defeat monsters. Also as a power-up are glowing treasures of some kind which are worth extra points. 

Your player also cannot take a fall, except for extremely small ones unless he is able to climb down vines. This means that when you shoot your rope and are climbing it, you are vulnerable. Even more so because enemies are allowed to &amp;quot;shake&amp;quot; the rope until you fall off if they reach the base of the rope. Pterodactyls fly overhead and drop eggs on the player.

There are 4 distinct levels; the cliff-side, the windmill, the waterfall and the peak. Completing all of these levels will restart the game with faster enemies and power-ups located in different places.</resource>

Players have the option of playing as either Rocky Balboa or Clubber Lang  as one battles the opponent in 10 rounds of boxing action.

The game utilizes Coleco's Super Action Controller letting players use the buttons to throw various punches and blocks, while using the joystick to move around the ring.  The computer opponent can be set at 4 different skill levels, or play head-to-head with a second player. The winner of a match does a victory strut to Eye Of The Tiger, the theme song from the movie.</resource>

There are four customers, each has its own lane lengthier than the previous one, whom you have to keep at bay. If they reach the end of the lane without receiving their beer, you're a goner; if you miss one and accidentally spill beer needlessly you lose a life and should one of them throw you back the mug and you fail to catch it, you lose a life as well.

Occasionally a bizarre icon will appear on one of the lines and, should you grab it, will invoke a &amp;quot;cabarette&amp;quot;-style show which will keep some of the customers occupied.

The Xbox 360 version includes bonus rounds, as well as co-op and versus multiplayer modes, also online, along with achievements.</resource>

He sees her and walks to her. He only has eyes for her and before he realizes it he finds himself in the New York sewer system.

Three Russian submarines have been located in the New York sewer system and they have blocked off the system.
Sam's only way out of the sewer system is to destroy the Russian submarines. Luckily, Sam carries his revolver.
Sam can't go back... once he's gone through the City Sewer Department seals the tunnel. Luckily, Sam carries his revolver.

The sewer system has three types of sewer tunnels. Tunnels with solid dry floors, tunnels with a water passage in the middle and tunnels with pits. 
Sam can walk, run and creep through the tunnels but Sam can't move as quickly in water.
Sam can move from tunnel to tunnel by entering one of the passages that appear occasionally on his way.
Each time he enters a new sewer, Sam receives a fresh supply of oxygen.

On it's way through the sewer system Sam is under attack by nasties like rats, bats, spiders and more.
The ultimate nasties are the Russian submarines. They are located only in water canals. The status bar at the top of the screen contains a distance indicator. It tells you how far Sam has traveled into the sewer. If it's red, it means there's a dreaded submarine at the end of the sewer.
The more nasty elements you shoot, the higher you'll score.</resource>

You control your snake as it slither's around the screen.  Where this game differs greatly from Centipede is that you can shoot in 4 different directions at the same time to take out the baddies trying to hunt you down.  The bad snakes hunting you down will appear from various angles on the screen, often several at a time.  The game was bundled with Coleco's Roller Controller and can't be played without it.</resource>

Prepare for Battle!&amp;quot; These are the words uttered by the alien commander upon starting a game of Space Fury. The gameplay is similiar to Asteroids in that you have one screen of space that wraps back on itself and your ship can only thrust and fire. However, whereas in Asteroids you faced pieces of rock that couldn't give chase, Space Fury instead provides alien vessels that will hunt you down. Each alien vessel starts in 4 pieces at diagonal corners which will try to join together. Shooting any of these pieces before is possible and will make things easier for your player. When one or more pieces reaches the center point, it combines with other pieces there and begins to fire upon and give chase to your vessel. There's only one screen of space, so your tactics are limited. However your vessel is not completely basic. Provided from the beginning are three superstructures, of which you can choose one, that provide additional firepower to your ship.</resource>

Your car is equipped with machine guns to help you get past the numerous enemies out on the road (be careful not to shoot any civilians, though!) Occasionally you will come across a weapons van, and if you drive into the back of the van your car becomes equipped with a second weapon (such as smoke screen, oil slick, or missiles.) At several points the road splits and you can enter a boathouse which transforms your car into a boat temporarily. If you drive far enough the seasons change as well (watch out for icy conditions during winter!) The enemy cars will do anything to stop you, including running you off the road, firing guns from the back of a limmo, or dropping bombs from a helicopter.</resource>

You are driving around a continuously deteriorating road, where potholes are forming. You must drive over these potholes to repair them. Along the way, you can drive over beach balls to pop them for points. Don't let a pothole go too long because if it does, it will become a manhole. If a beach ball falls into a manhole, it will emerge as a beach bomb, that can damage you. In a two player game, knock your opponent into the bombs.

Batting is done with an angled view wherein you see your batter in the bottom-left of the screen and the pitcher at center-right. The top part of the screen is reserved for keeping an eye on the bases. As the ball approaches, your player attempts to hit the ball with his bat to send it flying. A successful hit will result in your player having to run around the bases. Running is done with the &amp;quot;wheel&amp;quot; on the top of the Super Action Controllers. Stealing is also possible.

Fielding is simple, using the Super Action controllers, players have 4 buttons to correspond to each base. Thus the ball can be thrown at any of the bases instantly.</resource>

You're a chopper pilot on a surveillance mission in enemy territory; your goal is to make it through the various obstacle courses alive and score as many points as possible. Tall buildings, mountains, narrow tunnels, and various enemies (such as tanks, rockets, mines, and more) can all get in the way and destroy your chopper if you aren't careful. To help defend yourself, the chopper is armed with a machine gun and bombs which can be used to destroy the enemy tanks and rockets. To make the task more difficult, your chopper has a limited amount of fuel. Throughout the landscapes are fuel tanks; if one of these is shot or bombed, you will be awarded extra fuel. As the levels progress, the enemies become more aggressive, fuel becomes more scarce, and the landscape becomes trickier to navigate.</resource>

The key is your awesome &amp;quot;Spectron&amp;quot; weapon, which creates a dual holographic laser blast.

Each new level brings with it tougher, more heavily armed aircraft including jets, helicopters, and even flying saucers! From time to time, you will encounter a parachute; if you run into this, you will earn bonus points.</resource>

Ken St Andre read and tried to understand That Other Fantasy RPG, and decided that he could invent one that was easier to understand and so T&amp;T was born, over 30 years ago. The game has gone through several editions since then, but it remains popular and is played all over the world. A group of five of us created the latest version: the Deluxe Tunnels &amp; Trolls.</resource>

The object is to drive around a twisty course and collect all the colored flags. You can jump over gaps and over or onto other cars. If you land on another car, you kill them and collect points. You can also collect things like balloons and ice cream cones for bonus points. The faster you collect all the flags, the bigger a time bonus you get.

In later levels, there are dead-ends or gaps and a vehicle that is carrying a flag you need, so you will need to jump on him. If you are hit by another vehicle or go off the course, you lose a life. In two player games, play alternates.</resource>

It might remind people of Missile Command but the action is slower and spread over six screens which represent different areas of the U.S.A. Enemy missiles, planes, and subs will attack and you must direct your own forces, which include missiles, planes, subs, and satellites, to intercept them. Each type of defense has strengths and weaknesses (missiles are fast but limited in range, planes are slower but have unlimited range). Satellites are a better all-around defense but are only available every so often. Some weapons aren't available in certain areas, and some enemies are resistant to certain weapons, so you must alter your strategy accordingly.</resource>

Crystals can be found by exploring the various locations available, usually you will need to destroy one of the many enemies so they turn into a crystal. Fire and water crystals can not be in the cave alone at the same time, an air crystal must be placed between them; so you will need to bring back the crystals in the order fire, air, water or water, air, fire. Once you've done this a super crystal is formed unlocking the secret passage so you can try to get the diamond! Your dragon has a limited amount of energy; being hit by enemies will cause the energy to deplete, and the game ends when all of your dragons have lost all their energy.</resource>

Wizard of Id's WizMath is an educational game to teach mathematics. Using your joystick, you must move blocks into place so they complete a correct math problem and answer. If you push against a block, you will send it flying until it hits a wall or another block. You can also face a block and hold down the button. While keeping the button down, you can then slide the block as needed. There is a sixty second time limit and you are being pursued by Turnkey. Early levels require only one math problem to exit but later levels require two or more.

Early in the game, you can select a floor on an elevator. The higher the floor, the more difficult the math problems. The game also asks your age. The older you say you are, the higher a floor it tries to start you on, although you can select a lower floor.</resource>

Many barriers are alarmed, leaving you with limited space to progress through, and fire must constantly be dodged.

Stage two is a space shoot out against hordes of enemy aircraft - those you failed to destroy in the first part of the task. Complete this and you reach the final battle with Zaxxon, with the game looping with increased difficulty if you can survive the first time. There are 3 distinct skill levels, while controls involve using forward to dive and back to climb, in the manner of flight simulation.</resource>

    <resource id="bf351bb0d73d609f99e92ee471046e84e302c137" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">In Centipede, the player is trapped in the Enchanted Forest. Armed with only a magic wand to ward off the forest's insect denizens, all of which apparently are attacking in the player in continuous waves. 

The player must use the magic wand to shoot sparks at approaching insects to score points by pressing the controller button. Holding down the controller button will set the wand to rapid fire shots. If the player is bitten by an insect, the player will be temporarily paralyzed and lose one of the three starting magic wands. 

Insect Opponents and Mushrooms
All enemy insects have a distinctive sound before attacking, which may help the player identify which insect is attacking. Enemies and objects in the game are as the following:

1. The Centipede
The Centipede will attack in 12 waves. In the first wave, the Centipede will have a head attached to 11 body segments. In the second wave, the Centipede will have a head attached to 10 body segments, in addition to a detached head. The third wave will have the Centipede with an attached head, 9 body segments, plus two detached heads. These body segments will transform into heads and continue to do so until Wave 12. In the last wave, the Centipede will have 12 detached heads, independently attacking the player. Centipede heads are worth more points than body segments.

Attacks from the Centipede will come from the top of the screen, moving downward. If a spark hits any part of the Centipede, that particular body segment will transform into a mushroom, while the body segment behind it will become the new Centipede head. When the Centipede is destroyed, it will briefly disappear and re-appear from the top of the screen again.

The Spider
The Spider will attempt to distract the player from attacking the Centipede. It will destroy any mushroom it touches. Spiders will score more points if it is hit in closer distances.

The Flea
The Flea will appear if the player has destroyed most of the existing mushrooms. It will drop down creating a new batch of mushrooms where it falls. The Flea will disappear after two hits. After the first hit, the Flea will drop down much faster.

The Scorpion
The Scorpion will appear in the third wave. It moves slowly but will pick up speed, moving faster. While doing so, it will poison any mushroom it touches.

Mushrooms
Mushrooms fill the Enchanted Forest and may act as obstacles or cover for the player, with added effects to enemy insects. It takes for shots to complete destroy a mushroom. There are two type of mushrooms: Magic Mushrooms and Poisonous mushrooms. Magic mushrooms are the default mushrooms in the game and are also the the result of the player destroying an insect or Centipede body segment. Poisonous Mushrooms are the result of the Scorpion touching a mushroom. Poisonous Mushrooms will prompt the Centipede near it to move straight towards the player through any mushroom. Losing a wand will restore any partially damaged mushroom.

Game Difficulty and Variations
The game offers four difficulty levels: Novice, Standard, Advanced, and Expert. Game Variations are as the following:

1. One Player
Two Player Alternating
Two players will take turns when the active player is bitten.
Dual Player Competition
Two players will appear on the screen at the same time. Scoring is separate. Shots fired from one player will paralyze the other player.
Team Play
Two players will appear on the screen at the same time. Scoring is combined. Shots fired from one player will not paralyze the other player.

Scoring
The player will win a bonus magic wand for every 12,000 points to a maximum of six wands. The game will end when all wands are lost. Scoring are as the following:

Centipede Head - 100 points
Centipede Body Segment - 10 points
Spider at close range - 900 points
Spider at medium range - 600 points
Flea - 200 points

Unfortunately the location of this temple has gotten lost in time. Furthermore, many heros dispatched to seek it have been slain. A legend speaks that only the blood of the greatest hero of Apshai's greatest hero will be able to reclaim the lost Temple of Apshai. Unfortunately this &amp;quot;greatest hero&amp;quot; has also perished. But all hope is not lost, for the wise man, Merlis has  found the hero's son, whose blood is still able to fulfill the prophesy. With great haste, Merlis brings the youngster to the dungeon pits and leaves him to fend for himself. It is this youngster's destiny to find safe passage through the 8 levels, each of which contains passage to 99 different areas,

Gateway to Apshai is a top-down action-RPG. As the desendant of a hero, the player starts with basic stats in 4 areas, Strength, Agility, Luck and Health. and basic equipment, a dagger and leather armor. Then it's time to choose a number between 1 and 99 to generate the dungeon. Once begun, the player must explore the dungeon, hidden until explored and revealed. The player can move in four directions and has standard abilities, each mapped to a different control. There are several different actions available to the player. These include: fighting with the equipped weapon, a LOCATE spell to discover traps in the room, a SEARCH spell to discover hidden doors inside of room which would otherwise look like ordinary walls.  Players may also use many of the items and scrolls that can be picked up in the dungeon. The treasure can be picked up which include weaponry (swords, bows and arrows), healing slaves, precious items and magical scrolls. Most items are only good for a single use.

The Gateway to Apshai is guarded by an assortment of creatures including snakes, swamp rats, bats and many more. These enemies are only visible when they are in the same room as the player and are otherwise hidden. After 6 minutes and 30 seconds has passed, the player is teleported to the next dungeon, many versions of the game also offer the option to manually leave the dungeon at any time. Dungeons get progressively more difficult with faster and more vicious enemies.</resource>

To reach all of the floor sections, you will need to figure out how to get there! You can jump (be careful not to fall too far though, or you will be squished), climb up and down ladders, and use different transportation devices that can be found on the levels (such as an elevator, slides, a springboard, or a canon!) Wandering around the mine are numerous radioactive creatures which get in Bounty Bobs way. Also scattered throughout the mines are various artifacts left behind; if Bounty Bob collects one of these, the creatures will temporarily become vulnerable. If Bounty Bob runs into one of the creatures in this state the creature will be destroyed, but if he runs into a creature while it is glowing Bounty Bob will be destroyed! There is a total of ten different levels, and to complete them all you will need quick reflexes as well as figure out a unique strategy for each level.</resource>

    <resource id="cacca2fd61cee1ea8aa8c1cffb9ccad964882e9d" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Mr. Do!'s Castle is an action platform game which has you in a castle consisting of several floors, each of which contain a variety of blocks. You control Mr. Do! the clown who has a hammer which can be used to knock out the blocks in the floor. Wandering throughout the castle are deadly unicorns which are constantly trying to catch you. Your goal is to earn as many points as possible and to progress through the increasingly difficult castles. 

There are two ways to complete a castle; you can either destroy all of the deadly unicorns by crushing them with blocks, or you can knock out all of the blocks which have a cherry symbol on them. In addition to the cherry blocks, there are three blocks with a key. If all three key blocks are knocked out, the door on the roof of the castle unlocks. If you make it to the door, all of the unicorns will temporarily become harmless and will contain a letter. If you hit a letter unicorn, you will earn a letter in the word EXTRA. Spell the complete word, and you will earn an extra life. 

The last type of block you'll encounter has a skull on it. If you knock out two skull blocks, all of the blocks between them will also be knocked out and replaced with a bridge. As the castles progress, the castle layout will become trickier and the unicorns become faster and more numerous.</resource>

As Sir Lancelot, you need to ride your winged horse Pegasus to the rescue. Each level in this action game consists of two screens. First you are outside the castle which is guarded by numerous flying creatures. You need to fly around the screen and destroy all of the creatures by hitting them with your lance (careful, if they hit you instead you'll lose a life). After all of the creatures are gone, you enter the second screen which is inside the castle. Here there is a large pit of lava and a flying dragon. To destroy the dragon you need to hit it's stomach with your lance. If you are hit by one of the dragon's fireballs you'll be temporarily stunned and unable to fly. If you end up falling into the lava, you'll lose a life. If you can defeat the dragon, the game repeats at a higher difficulty level. The game ends when you lose all of your lives.</resource>

Fortunately nearly every monster in the game can be eaten as well. If an enemy touches Slurpy, you can kiss one of your precious lives goodbye; but woe to the enemy that strays in front of Slurpy's trunk and is caught by his amazing suction power!</resource>

Your mission is to save the Federation from NOMAD! Before you get a chance at destroying NOMAD, you'll have to battle your way through ten levels (each consisting of multiple rounds). In each round you may encounter Klingon fighters, deadly anti-matter saucers, asteroid fields, and deadly meteors, all of which are capable of depleting the Enterprises energy. The game ends when your energy supply has completely run out. To fight these dangers, the Enterprise is equipped with an unlimited supply of phasers and a limited supply of photon torpedoes. Each round also contains one or more starbases; if you dock at a starbase, some of your supplies (such as energy and torpedoes) will be replenished. The game is played from two points of view; the top of the screen contains a third person view of the Enterprise (along with the ships gauges), and on the bottom of the screen is a first person point of view</resource>

Besides that your spacecraft is equipped with a laser that tends to overheat. Every shot make the heat bar of the laser increase a bit.

Matches can be played at quarter-final, semi-final or final level - winning at one level automatically moves you onto the next one. They can last for 3 or 5 sets, with a player requiring a 2-game lead to win a set, although a tie-break comes in at 6-6 in all but the final set.

The view is pseudo-3D, from above the court, and features a shadow on the ball to give a more realistic appearance and make it easier to judge its height. Spectators turn their heads to view the action, and ball-boys run on to the court to retrieve a dead ball. Shot speed, direction and spin can all be applied, and forehand and backhand strokes are both available.</resource>
