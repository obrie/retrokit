You incarnate the young Thunder (?) who wakes up in what seems to be a scientific complex. Quickly, he gets caught by a shady guy with a big hat, a mustache and black glasses. Then begins a dialogue phase (all importants dialogues are doubled), and at different moments, we are invited to take decisions.</resource>

The player's ship moves automatically through pre-rendered space and planetary environments and only the targeting crosshair can be moved freely. Laser Cannons and Fusion Warheads are available to hit the numerous enemies. Lasers have unlimited ammunition but need a few moments time to recharge. The warheads function as smart bombs and clear the screen of enemies, but are available only in limited supply. They are restocked when reaching a certain score. The ship's energy shield functions as a life bar.

Between the shooting levels, there are transitional cutscenes, pre-rendered in the same way as the actual gameplay.</resource>

The Dark Knight suspects that one or more of the usual suspects might be involved, including Poison Ivy, Riddler, and The Joker. He sets out in his trusty Batmobile to set the situation right. Much of the game consists of 3D driving action behind the wheel of the Batmobile. There are also levels in which the Caped Crusader must stage an aerial assault using the Batwing. In between levels, the player is treated to a series of cutscenes which comprise nearly an entire exclusive episode of Batman: The Animated Series, upon which the game is based.</resource>

Naturally all the grown-ups get in the way by making him go to school, making him clean his room, etc. But now that's school's out for the summer, Willy is determined to have a good time and maybe even have his pet frog win the frog jumping contest. However Willy has a habit of getting into trouble, and naturally that means it will be a challenge to get out of it.

The Adventures of Willy Beamish is a point-and-click graphical adventure. You play Willy Beamish, an eight year-old kid who is just trying to get through life without losing his lunch money. But he'll have to deal with parents, teachers, babysitters and bratty sisters. The player must solve different puzzles to ensure Willy can progress, get out of trouble and generally avoid ending up grounded. 

The in-game time progresses even if no action is taken. This means many puzzles have to be solved in a certain time frame or rely on being in the right place at the right time. A special aspect of this game is a bar which shows Willy's relationship to his parents. It gets affected by the way certain situations are resolved, e.g. it increases if Willy refuses to play with his sister, and when it is full they send Willy to a military school and the game is lost.</resource>

A Sega CD exclusive, the title is actually a port of SEGA's arcade fight-sim Strike Fighter, a Japan-only arcade release that attempted to mix the sim &amp;quot;lite&amp;quot; gameplay of G-Loc Air Battle with After Burner's arcade gimmicks. As such, the game features the ability to play both in the cockpit as well as in the classic third person perspective. Both night and day scenarios are now available, with mission objectives that include new air-ground strikes. 

Includes 3 gameplay modes: Arcade, Timed and &amp;quot;Hits&amp;quot; which measures how many enemies you can shoot down in specific waves. No multiplayer support available.</resource>

The entire game, including towns and building interiors, is explored from a 3D third-person perspective; individual rooms and transitional areas are navigated in a point-and-click adventure game style. Battles play out in a semi-active fashion, with the player giving each character specific commands, which they will follow until instructed to do otherwise.</resource>

This SegaCD game is a side-scrolling action title that makes use of digitized backgrounds (sometimes with interesting effects), digitized actors/objects, voice breifings before each level and full motion video cutscenes from the film. 

The top of the screen is taken up by a stylish display showing the player's score, health bar and the health bar of the enemy boss of the level (should there be one). Players, controlling Jonathan Harker can move left and right on the screen, jump in the air, perform a high kick and rapidly punch. Using these skills, Jonathan must defeat all manner of enemies including bats, zombies, vampires, . Powerups can be found at various points, usually descending from the top of the screen. These include: an invulnerability powerup which also instantly kills enemies, a heath restore powerup.</resource>

The game is mostly platformer-based, but has many points
where FMV will cut in that may have something to do with
the area you are in. You have about 15 minutes
to disarm a bomb and save the city. During this time, you
have to shoot your way through sewers infested with mutant
humanoids and rats, and circus tents with insane clowns throwing bombs at you. You need to break walls to find other passages, and even break into a space shuttle launch pad. Does it sound crazy? It is!</resource>

It is an &amp;quot;on rails&amp;quot; style shooter with the player controlling only the aiming of the shooting but not the direction of the helicopter.  

Your job is to shoot down the enemies as you are flown through footage of New York streets, the Statue of Liberty, the Atlantic Ocean, Italy, the Grand Canyon and finally, the treacherous corners and return fire of the enemy's stronghold on Easter Island.

There is no background music to go along with the sound effects.  The levels are fairly short with a total game run through possible in about 20 minutes.</resource>

The game is played from a first-person perspective.  Various zombies pop up in front of a video background, and you shoot them down by moving a cursor on screen or by using a light gun.  The Saturn version has a few different features including extra power-ups as well as added footage of enemies.</resource>

The second describes the adventures of another young man, Van, whose girlfriend was kidnapped by an evil wizard. Both games are set in a sci-fi universe with intergalactic traveling. 

The Sega CD edition features improved graphics and music (the change is particularly noticeable in the first Cosmic Fantasy). It also re-vamps the gameplay system of the first game, allowing previously passive characters to participate in battles, but also increasing the amount of enemies met in battles and modifying the difficulty level.</resource>

The game is very text heavy, so even with some kind of translation guide, playing the game is a daunting task.  The combat is also very tough, so only the most hardcore will likely continue playing.  Still, it features quality music and the game features, you guessed it, animated cut scenes.  The game itself isn't too shabby to look at either.  It plays as a standard turn-based JRPG.</resource>

Earnest Evans is a brave treasure hunter. His grandfather was a famous archaeologist who searched for three legendary idols in the 1930s. It was said that those idols could bring disaster upon the Earth if fallen into the wrong hands. But despite his efforts, he could never find even one of the idols. Now it's up to the grandson to continue his work, fifty years later. But the evil syndicate leader Brady Tressider has his own plans, and will do anything to stop Earnest...

This is an action platform game in which you control Earnest Evans, armed with his trusty whip. The hero can jump, climb ropes, crouch, and crawl. There are plenty of obstacles on the levels (bottomless pits, spikes, crushing bridges, lava, etc.), as well as gangsters and monsters to dispose of.</resource>

Ecco: The Tides of Time features even better graphics than its predecessor, and introduces a new gameplay mode in which the camera follows the dolphin from behind instead of from the side.</resource>

Indeed, you can do pretty much everything a typical dolphin does, including eating fish, surfacing in order to breathe, using your biological sonar and of course, jumping out of the water to amaze your friends.

The storyline is actually deeper that one may think by looking at the box illustration. As Ecco, you are the only dolphin who managed to escape from a giant whirlpool which sucked down your entire pod. The five shining stars on your forehead show that you are the chosen one to save them. But that task will be not be an easy one, as you will have to travel through time and space with the Atlantean time machine, and meet the mystical Asterite in order to defeat the Vortex Queen.</resource>

As usual, the game features an NPB license and includes all 12 Pacific and Central League teams with full 1993 rosters, along with All-Star teams for each league.

Gameplay is largely unchanged from previous installments, utilizing the standard catcher's view for both batting and pitching. The game includes the usual Pennant Race and Exhibition match modes. New in this version are the additions of a Home Run Contest mode and a team database.

Alongside Konami's Hyper Dunk, Super League CD is one of the few commercialized games that supports up to eight players with the use of two SegaTap adapters.

    <resource id="695135fbe1b03b386894a555bd3e483e8297cef9" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">The game that started the best-selling series licensed by football's world governing body, this first installment in the long running series used a dimetric (colloquially known as &amp;quot;isometric&amp;quot;) viewpoint, previously unusual in football games but quickly imitated by several titles. The televisual presentation, one of the unique points of the early EA Sports titles, with hosts introducing the matches, was another thing making the game stand out from a market dominated by Sensible Soccer and Kick Off games.

Based on international teams (with fictional player names), their abilities in each skill area rated out of 10 to give the player an overall impression of how good they are. The options available follow the standard set: fouls and offsides can be toggled on and off, the match length can be set, and if the timer operates  continuously, or only while the ball is in play. Gameplay privileges quick runs, short passes and blistering shots outside the penalty box, and set pieces are controlled by moving a box into the target area for the ball, and then passed, lobbed or kicked directly. On the tactical side, formations can be selected, with 5 different strategies also available (although not all of these combinations make sense) as can the team Coverage - the areas which defenders, midfielders and strikers cover.</resource>

You are the new guy in the firehouse.  Last week, you saved three lives. But now, you're on a new squad, and have to prove yourself to them.

Like most interactive movies, Fahrenheit is played entirely while watching a digitized video. At certain critical points in the video, players must press certain directions on the control pad or action buttons in order to progress in the game. Fahrenheit takes this a step further by providing several buildings in which the player has the ability to move from room to room in in a non-linear fashion. As players move from room to room, they have to locate victims and neutralize fire hazards.</resource>

The evil wizard Wicked Wainwright has captured the four elders and it is up to Flink, a wizard's apprentice, to set them free and defeat Wicked Wainwright.

Apart from the usual platformer elements, the game has a unique feature: Flink's ability to create spells. Whenever the game is paused, Flink can combine three ingredients to create a spell. Ingredients can be collected throughout the game. They are usually carried around by a certain type of enemy or hidden in treasure chests. There are ten different spells, the &amp;quot;recipes&amp;quot; which are contained in scrolls that are given to Flink by rescued elders or found within certain levels. The spells include different attack spells (for example a demon that accompanies Flink and attacks his enemies), a shield spell, a shrink spell, a quick grow spell that lets certain plants grow so that Flink can reach new areas of a level, magic keys that open locked treasure chests and more. 
Casting spells uses up magic energy that can be replenished by collecting magic bottles or defeating enemies. Similar to the Sonic games, when Flink is hit, he looses all of his magic energy and has only limited time to pick it up again. If he is hit while having no magic energy, he loses a life.</resource>

- Paddle Fighter: a famous game of table hockey, a treat that will test your reflexesnn- Pyramid Magic: a little game of archeology in the manner of Rick Dangerous but much less successfulnn- Phantasy star 2 (Shilka's Adventure, Amia's Adventure, Huey's Adventure and Eusis's Adventure): a text game reserved for fans of the genre</resource>

It is a sequel to Another World and continues the story directly from where the original ended. The game switches the player's role from Another World; this time the player takes control of Buddy, the main character's alien ally from the previous game.

The story picks up immediately after the end of Another World. Buddy lands the pterodactyl in the ruins of his village, lays Lester down on a cot to rest and walks through the village, thinking of his past. This sequence contains many flashbacks of events that lead up to Buddy's capture and his and Lester's escape from prison. In the game, Buddy is searching for the red-eyed alien responsible for the destruction of his village and the imprisonment of his people. Buddy enters again the prison in search of the red-eyed alien.

Near the end of the game, Lester who wakes back up, helps Buddy out, but then dies in the process. Buddy then goes to find again the red-eyed alien in a fortress. Eventually, he is able to find him and traps him in a cage with a beast that kills him. At the end of the game, Buddy gives Lester's body a ceremonial cremation. It is shown later how Buddy's village is rebuilt with its citizens living again in harmony.</resource>

The greatest of these are known as the Heavy Nova, a title earned by passing a rigorous training regime.

You are taking on the simulated proving grounds, which are split into two styles of alternating action. In the first you must progress (initially purely horizontally, though later with vertical flick-scrolling as well) through a hostile environment of enemies, bombs and traps, gaining points for doing it quickly and with lots of energy left. Initially you can fly and kick as needed.

Once this section is complete, you move on to one-on-one combat of the Street Fighter 2 style. The early foes have far less energy than you begin with. As you progress through the game, you are awarded extra attacking moves, in a manner similar to Brutal: Paws of Fury</resource>

Heimdall's job is to protect the entrance to Asgard, the home of the gods, from all evil, including the terrible Ragnarok, when all the evil forces come together to try and destroy the gods and ultimately everything. 

Unfortunately Ragnarok is on its way and if that wasn't bad enough, Loki, god of mischief, has hidden Thor's hammer, Odin's sword and Frey's spear in three worlds. You, as the newly mortalized Heimdall, must visit each of these worlds to collect the god's weapons.

The first is Midgard (or Earth), the second is Utgard (the world of the giants) and the third is Asgard itself, the home of the gods. Each world has around 15 islands and each island has countless rooms.

When you start your mission you are given three sub-games to complete. How well you complete these games determines Heimdall's stats (strength, agility etc) as well as how many people he can choose from to make up his party. If you don't do well then you won't get the full 30 characters to choose from and some of the better ones will not be available to you.

The first sub-game is the Axe Throwing Contest. Here you must throw axes at a young barmaid tied to a stock by her pig-tails. The idea is to hit the pig-tails and not her! Unfortunately because Heimdall is a bit drunk, your cursor wobbles all over the place! The second sub-game is Pig Catching (where you must chase and hopefully catch a pig in its pen) and the third is the Long Boat Fight (where you must try and get to the other side of the long boat without being thrown overboard).

Once you've done this it's time to wander around the isometric landscape solving puzzles and killing baddies (in a similar style to Cadaver) until you eventually find one of the god's missing weapons.</resource>

This particular interpretation is a side-scrolling action game, in which players must hack their way past Hook's denizens through 11 levels.  These include forests, icy regions, and towns which Peter will have to jump, climb, and swim through. Magic items such as apples and pixie dust can be collected for special powers. When enemies are attacked, they simply put their hands up in surrender rather than dying, so as to make the game more child-friendly.</resource>

A virus has wiped out its crew, but the threat of it firing its Iron Helix doomsday weapon is still there. You must remotely pilot an unarmed science robot to explore the ship and work out how to shut the weapon down.

The game uses interactive quarter-screen footage to display the ship's interiors. The main challenge is that an automated security device is chasing you down, and must be avoided and ultimately destroyed. A delay between your commands and the robot's receipt of them forces you to pay close attention to the security drone and plan several steps ahead.

As you explore the ship, you will find data ports, which can be jacked into to gain information or to open doorways. To access most of these, you will need to find and collect a DNA sample from a member of staff whose role gave him/her access.</resource>

The game is completely menu driven, with the player choosing actions for each day as the game progresses, such as visiting a certain place or meeting with a specific person. The ultimate goal is to gain experience solving citizens' problems and earn enough popularity campaigning -- or by using items to swing public opinion in the player's favor -- to win the popular vote.</resource>

Core Design acquired the right to build a game around it, in a move to counter Gremlin's immensely successful Lotus series.

Just like Lotus, Jaguar XJ200 is a view from behind racer. There are 32 tracks all over the world, with varying road conditions and animated weather conditions such as rain and fog in England, snow in Switzerland, and tumbleweed crossing the street in Egypt. You race your Jaguar in a constructor grand prix, with opponents running for Porsche, Ferrari and other famous makers. Between races, you must mend the damage your car has sustained, which eats up your prize money. Background music is selected through a dashboard CD player, which also features some rather uninspiring radio stations.

The game can also be played in a two-player split-screen mode and features a track editor for when you tire of the built-in courses.</resource>

This game differs greatly from other Jurassic Park games. It is a point-and-click adventure game, with a strong emphasis on action sequences which require split-second timing.

The story takes place after the events of the movie/book. You are sent back to Jurassic Park to retrieve dinosaur eggs from around the park and put them in an incubator. You only have 12 hours to retrieve one egg from every species of dino in the park. Unfortunately, shortly before arriving at the park, your helicopter crashes!</resource>

With this game you have the opportunity to try them out! You can use either the excavator, bulldozer, steamroller or wrecking ball. The handling couldn't be easier, there are just three buttons to press: left, right and use.

With each machine you get a simple task, e.g. carry three shovels of dirt on a truck. But the fun thing is that you aren't restricted to this and can just screw around. Why wreck an old house when the pit latrine is so much more tempting? The whole game is presented in full motion video - the reactions are very humorous and with a fair share of slapstick. To improve the long time motivation there are even multiple videos for every action, e.g. the first time you break a road block with the the excavator you drive on a highway, the second time into a canyon, the third time onto a rollercoaster and so on...</resource>

    <resource id="40542133e558e853c471085528be266006b0ada2" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">The Lawnmower Man is the game based on the 1992 movie of the same name (itself loosely based on a Stephen King short story)  starring pre-Bond fame Pierce Brosnan as Dr. Lawrence Angelo, a scientist working for Virtual Space Industries in &amp;quot;Project 5&amp;quot;, a secret research that attempts to increase the intelligence of primates using psychotropic drugs and VR training. 

With his reluctance to aim the research to military purpose, after one of the chimps escapes and shoots a guard in the process he is given a forced vacation, and while taking notes on the need for experiment with a human subject, he notices Jobe Smith (Jeff Fahey), a simpleton who makes his living on odd jobs such as mowing the grass (hence, the title role). The first experiments quickly increase Jobe's intelligence, and while after an accident Angelo stopped the experiments, The Shop, a secret agency overviewing Project 5, reinserted the drugs responsible for violent behaviour into the program and sped up the treatment. As Jobe starts to develop telekinetic powers, he starts to take revenge on those who abused him before he started the treatments, and plots to take over all computers in the world.

While the CD version of the game (PC, Mega CD) is an interactive movie, both cartridge versions are platformers, the player taking control of Dr. Angelo or Carla Parkette (mother of Jobe's best friend) in typical side-scrolling shooting action. The player can collect better weapons or data discs, which after collecting a number of them allow to morph into the Virtual Suit, which gives protection against a first hit. The player visits several locations seen in the movie, such as the gas pump and the VSI headquarters. 

The twists of the game are true-3D level connectors, based on the CG sequences of the movie, usually all involving avoiding obstacles (and the occasional shooting) at high speed in the VR world. There are four different (Virtual World, Cyber War, Cyber Run and Cyber Tube), each taking a slightly different approach (Virtual World is seen in first person, the objective being dodging obstacles such as trees and archs and reach the exit, Cyber War similar to Virtual World but with some shooting stops, Cyber Run is seen in third person and requires occasional shooting of obstacles, while Cyber Tube is a fast travel with plenty of enemies in a VR tunnel).</resource>

Duran, descendant of Drak, is the only one who can stop the Garuda Empire's mad plan, and with the power of Drak's mystic armors, he heads off to stop Sornbul at any cost.

The six continents of Mistral can be challenged in any order, each of which are filled with hordes of demons and one of Sornbul's Dark Generals. After completing all six continents the player will face Sornbul on the final island. Before a level the player can choose from one of four elemental armors, each with its own bullet spread and unique bomb. The armor's attack can be powered up several levels by finding jewels dropped by enemies. This power level, as well as the armor's health, is reduced when hit. Enemies also drop crystals that are used in a between-level shop to buy additional health, bombs, and continues.</resource>

A sequel to the moderately popular Mad Dog McCree, the game abandoned the rather simple style of the original, introducing elements that can be considered &amp;quot;Hollywood&amp;quot;, including dynamic shootout scenes and in-game music, as opposed to the original's almost complete lack thereof. Like the first game, the player follows the storyline and is required to quickly shoot certain enemies to proceed on the quest.</resource>

The Mega-CD and Game Gear versions were released exclusively in Europe, though the Mega-CD port was unofficially brought to the US via Good Deal Games who started selling unlicensed reproductions sometime in the 2000s.

In Marko's Magic Football you play as Marko, a football player who uses his football to complete various platforming tasks.

The UK's Sonic the Comic featured several strips based on the character during its early years. A Sega Master System version was reportedly in development at some stage too, although was cancelled.</resource>

The player controls Frankenstein's monster as he stomps through the streets of Ingolstadt, Bavaria, in the year 1793 seeking revenge against a certain man named Victor for rejecting him once he was created. Since he is a product of artificial manufacturing, he is condemned and declared an expendable pariah by peasants and soldiers. The common folks that strive to kill Frankenstein's monster are highly ignorant about modern science and believe that he is truly a demon.

The player uses a wooden stick to ward off enemies. The stick that Frankenstein's monster carries can be put on fire if swung towards fire. Frankenstein also has an additional attack; a blue ball of negative energy that pops up when the player releases the button. Peasants in the game can either be male or female; soldiers are always male. The female peasants attack with pots while the male peasants attack with melee weapons. However, the soldiers (men dressed in red) attack the player with musket shots. Simple puzzles involving switches and pulleys must be solved in order to progress within the levels.</resource>

This FMV game adapts scenes from the movie Masked Rider ZO, and creates a Dragon's Lair style experience. The game centers around 10 battles of the film's 3 main characters.

The player watches the video and hits the correct direction or button at the right time to achieve success. The visual cues of the movie suggest the correct buttons. For example, when the Masked Rider punches, the player should press the Punch button. If he dodges left on screen, the player should press the left direction pad. Correct timing hits the enemy harder, lowering their health bar. Failure reduces the players health.</resource>

CyberTech Industries, the dominant company on the planet, is being challenged by Axiom, who blames the former for their president's death.  To gain revenge, they secretly inject CyberTech's president, Anton Korsby, with a virus that threatens to take over his body, and ultimately destroy himself and CyberTech. Your mission is to enter Korsby's body, destroy the virus, and defeat the organism that controls his brain.

Microcosm is a 3D action shooter, similar to Descent, that takes place entirely within the human body. The concept was inspired by the 1966 movie Fantastic Voyage. The player pilots his way through various parts of the anatomy, blasting virii and enemy ships, while gaining power-ups and faster, stronger craft. The goal of the game is to eventually reach the brain to stop Grey M, the entity that controls Korsby's body.

Microcosm makes heavy use of full-motion video and features high-resolution fractal graphics (to simulate the walls of veins and arteries), digital music and sound effects.</resource>

Joker and crew must fly to the refinery, shooting down enemy tanks and helicopters, then Joker must rappel down to the refinery and rescue the chemist on foot.

The helicopter sections follow a pattern similar to Tomcat Alley, showing brief clips of the cast in the cockpit, followed by a &amp;quot;nose camera&amp;quot; shot of an enemy approaching. During this shot, you have the ability to move a set of crosshairs over the enemy and press the &amp;quot;fire&amp;quot; button. If you're on target, you are rewarded with military archival footage of helicopters shooting rockets, and close up footage of models exploding. 

The on-foot sections follow an identical pattern, though with hand-held cameras placing you in the &amp;quot;eyes&amp;quot; of Joker, and black-clad guards taking the place of helicopters. Otherwise, the idea of having a few seconds to react and aim crosshairs is the same. The plot is expanded through occasional cutscenes in both the helicopter and foot sections.</resource>

Shang was accompanied by Prince Goro, a warrior of the Shokan race (a four armed half-human/half-dragon). Knowing that if ten tournaments in a row were won by the Outworld champion, the Earth Realm would be conquered by evil and fall into darkness, Shang entered Goro in the tournament and had him defeat the great Kung Lao. Goro has been  reigning supreme as the undefeated fighting champion for five hundred years now. As the last tournament required draws near, Raiden, Thunder God and protector of the Earth Realm, enacts a plan to tip the scales in the humans favor, Seven fighters step into the arena on Shang Tsung's mysterious island: Shaolin warrior Liu Kang, Special Forces operative Sonya Blade, the mercenary thug Kano, fame-seeking actor Johnny Cage, the ice wielding Lin Kuei warrior Sub-Zero and his undead adversary Scorpion, and Raiden himself.

Mortal Kombat is a side-scrolling 1 on 1 fighting game. Fighting is set as one on one kombat, allowing each player to perform a variety of punches, kicks, and special moves in order to defeat their opponent.  When the opponent faces their second round loss, the winner can perform a finishing move called a &amp;quot;Fatality&amp;quot; on the loser.  The Fatality is a move unique to each fighter that graphically kills the loser in a blood-soaked finale.

Mortal Kombat began its life as a 2-player arcade title. It is notable for its use of digitized actors to represent the game's fighters, as well as its use of copious amounts of blood during gameplay.</resource>

Full performance statistics are automatically recorded. The play clock and 3-point line apply, but other rules are largely overlooked.</resource>

Aside from the licenses, the gameplay for this edition sees for the first time the inclusion of the devastating one-timer shot, but to keep forwards (literally) in check, defenders also feature harder body checks, with new animations. For an additional challenge, players can also choose to control the goalkeeper manually. A popular feature in previous editions, fighting is completely removed from the game. Game modes include exhibition games (or &amp;quot;regular season&amp;quot; in-game), playoffs (best of one or best of seven) and an all new shoot-out mode. The main options remain basically the same couple since the establishment of the series - period length (5, 10 or 20 minutes), line changes (off, manual or the new automatic mode) and penalties. (off, on, on but no offsides).</resource>

    <resource id="54d83a0469950594aeba6bca1762edf3016235bb" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Night Striker is a third-person shooter reminiscent of Space Harrier, converted from the 1989 Taito coin-op. Laser opticts expert Dr. Lindvery Maska and his daughter have been kidnapped by a terrorist group, and Dick Dagras, head of the Special Service Agency, is mobilizing a group of elite soldiers experienced in the use of special armored flying cars, in order to rescue Dr. Maska and destoy this terrorist group.

The player flies through each stage, controlling their armored car and shooting down waves of enemies. A boss appears at the end of each stage, and after this the player must choose what path to take in the next stage, as in Darius. Instead of lives, the player has a shield that takes damage from each hit, but is recharged at the end of each stage.

The Sega CD version of the game features remixed CD-audio, and the Saturn version features a set of exclusive bonus levels.</resource>

Five girls disappear without a trace... Now another five girls go there, in order to spend the vacation with the Martins, the owners of the house, in particular with the lovely Ms. Martin. This time, you should not let them die a gruesome death! Because &amp;quot;nice people&amp;quot; can sometimes turn out to be... yes, that's right - vampires. The whole house is full of traps, that are intended to catch the poor innocent girls, so that the vampires can suck their blood... ugh. Luckily, the brave adventurer is there in order to cease to be hunted and to become a hunter instead! Set the traps so that they will capture the villains themselves, using precise timing and good organization.

Night Trap was the very first game that used the FMV (full-motion video) technology with live actors. Although it didn't contain nudity or particularly gory scenes, it was considered one of the first games to have a mature content.</resource>

The player(s) controlled robot Ninjas, which battled their way through the levels using Shuriken and knives. As the Ninja's took damage their classic Ninja garb was torn away to reveal robotic limbs, torso or head. When the damage reached critical the Ninja Robot would explode, scattering mechanical body parts.

As with The Sales Curve's later title SWIV, The Ninja Warriors used the company's Dynamic Loading System to load sprites, sound and background graphics from disk on the fly.</resource>

While you might think that a cute Anime chick would have no trouble making a living slashing bad guys with her sword, Popful is having a hard time making ends meet.  One day, however, Popful learns about a magician who has gone rogue and has a hefty bounty on his head. So, her adventure begins as Popful fights her way through a new adventure, and makes new friends along the way.

Primarily this is an action game with very slight RPG elements. As you make your way through the plethora of levels, you will have to collect money from slain foes. You use this money in the shops to buy weapons, armor, health, and so on. Also, this game features interaction with many, many characters through both on-screen dialog and fully animated sequences. Some of these characters become playable as you progress through the game.

This release has the same story and general gameplay style as the  earlier version, but otherwise was made from scratch, having entirely different graphics, locations, enemies, challenges, etc.</resource>

The plot puts you inside the music factory of the game's name, where two linemen sweat and toil under the oppressive thumb of a wheelchair-bound corporate executive. Video discs literally roll down an assembly line while C + C record their sounds behind three closed doors. You are asked to help out in editing these videos, appease the corporate masters, and lift the burden from everyone.

The game is played from a panel meant to resemble and act as a non-linear editor. Editing is entirely linear however, as three distinct video &amp;quot;feeds&amp;quot; run simultaneously along the bottom of the screen. Each is mapped to the A, B, or C button, and pressing one sends that video to master viewer, where it is recorded. The D-pad toggles various effects on and off from a bin in the upper left. One feed will always be of C + C's actual video, with the other two holding appropriate stock footage (like a doorbell timed to appear with the lyrics &amp;quot;Ding dong, who is it?&amp;quot;)

The video can not be stopped or rewound once the editing process begins, so the player must quickly route video to the viewer and apply effects within a given amount of time. This allows for editing challenges, where the player must fill specific requests, like having fast cuts or showing no dancers.

After a video is edited, the player gets to watch their cut in its entirety. They are then graded by the FMV characters and move to the next song, or try a new edit of the previous one.</resource>

The game cast the player as a dispossessed warlord plundering his way through 195 territories on the way to world conquest. Several other leaders have the same goal.

The gameworld is now made up of polygons, so the view can be rotated and moved with greater freedom than Populous. Trade, diplomacy, inventions, and scorched earth invasions all play a key role in how the player progressed through the game.  Two-player games via modem links are available on computer versions.</resource>

You're not going to let that happen are you? Try to escape from the dungeon, take out Jaffar's guards, find your way through the Sultan's palace and defeat Jaffar himself. Now go, you've got 60 minutes!

Prince of Persia is a 2D platformer with run and jump gameplay. Your hero must avoid deadly traps, solve some simple puzzles and engage in sword fights with the guards. The player has an infinite amount of lives, but has to restart at the beginning of a level each time he dies, and must complete the game within an hour. An especially noteworthy aspect of the game is the very fluent animation of your character.

The Game Boy Color and SNES versions of the game feature additional levels and new enemies. The Genesis version has a new intro and an altered set of graphics but the level layout remains almost identical to that of the original.</resource>

While the game requires a completely different approach than sprite or polygonal games, the tactics are still the same - jab, punch and deliver uppercuts when the opponent has his defenses down, and block and bob as he makes his moves. After a win the player can improve his left and right glove abilities and stamina by assigning &amp;quot;Power Points&amp;quot; to each area.

The only sprites visible during the bouts are the player gloves and the health indicators - the boxers and the rest of the ring are black and white FMV. Like with other FMV games, the player can enable  tips, which indicates to hit certain butttons when required.</resource>

It was only released in Japan. It was followed by Psychic Detective Series Vol. 4: Orgel in the same year.

Only a few people possess the unique ability to read people's hearts; those people are called psychic analysts, and Katsuya Furuyagi is one of them. One day, a fellow analyst pays him an unexpected visit and directs him towards a mysterious old man named Kamiya. Reading the old man's mind, Furuyagi ventures into the realm of memories, where a woman's ghost is attempting to avenge her own murder.

Aya is the third installment of the Psychic Detective series. Like in the previous entries, it is a Japanese-style adventure game with first-person view and menu-based interaction and navigation. Commands such as &amp;quot;Look&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Ask&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Move&amp;quot; must be used on most screens in order to advance the plot.

Quiz Scramble Special is a comic Japanese-style quiz game. In each zone, there are multiple opponents that will challenge the player to answer questions, and the goal is to answer a certain number correctly before the timer expires. Answering a question incorrectly will cause the player to lose time; when the timer runs out, the player loses a life, and when all lives are gone, it's game over. The game includes both a single-player mode and a two-player cooperative mode. There are also mini-games between stages such as a pie-throwing contest.</resource>

While playing Rex collects eggs, health, power-ups for his fire breath and scream refills. Checkpoints are shown as torches that need to be charged with fire. After each level, there is a Bomberman-like sequence to earn an extra continue. Enemies include flies, turtles, toads and all kinds of dinosaurs.</resource>

Instead of the more traditional Japanese RPG-style world map top-down navigation and random battles, the game has a linear world map and pre-set battles. The strategic element of the battles is stronger, since the battle screens are larger and it is not possible to set battles on auto. Each attack is shown graphically on a separate screen. Hostile areas have standard top-down navigation, while towns are viewed from first-person perspective, and the navigation in them is menu-based.

The game has voice acting and real anime movie sequences instead of the usual 2D cut-scenes characteristic for anime-style Sega CD games.</resource>

Some of the villians you face are Marco Killmore (a half man, half eagle samurai warrior), Zallen (a disgraced samurai warrior out to destroy Hayate), Vengor (a stone shiva-type character), Desfal (a medusa-like woman), Destroyer MPK (a possessed collection of samurai armor) and of course the evil samurai knight himself, Lougi.

To play the game you must press the corresponding buttons on the screen at a certain time, such as pressing left to go left or possibly to avoid a enemies weapon or pressing one of the regular buttons to draw your weapon and attack a certain enemy, much like Dragon's Lair and Space Ace. There are three difficulty levels, each one giving you a certain amount of time to press the buttons, the hardest setting giving you the least amount of time.</resource>

    <resource id="b392589e8b82f99ef90686da2e4cd5107f5bdf73" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Road Avenger dates from the era when interactive movies (e.g. Dragon's Lair, Escape from Cybercity, Time Gal...) with film-quality graphics, but limited player movement, were highly popular.

Players assume the role of an angry cop on a wild ride as he pursues a gang of bikers who killed his wife. Players need to race through oncoming traffic, squeeze between trucks, trash motorcycles and steer through lots of explosions. The only thing needed are quick reflexes to follow the instructions on the screen (with an increasing difficulty) in order to keep the animation going.

The action is shown from a first-person view and fast-paced, while still maintaining smooth and detailed anime drawn graphics.</resource>

    <resource id="c7e8f00b9197dee58610b6a65788b9fcedb7d351" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">This is a remake of the original Road Rash from the early nineties. For those who have not played the original, you are competing against thirteen other &amp;quot;Road Rashers&amp;quot; who will stop at nothing to win 1st, 2nd, or 3rd place. During the race, you have two options available to you: you can either do your best to cross the finish line, or use your weapon to bring the Rashers to the ground if they are giving you trouble. If you do the latter, your opponents will do the same to you during the next race that takes place. 

There are five circuits to race: The City, The Peninsula, Pacific Highway, Sierra Nevada, and Napa Valley. Some of these circuits are dangerous. As well as the obstacles and traffic that you encounter along the way, there are also cops driving on bikes who will arrest you if you happen to crash or stop your bike near them, and you have to pay a fine in order to get in any more races. Your bike will be wrecked if you crash too many times, and you have to pay for damages, but the amount you have to pay depends on the bike that you are riding. Once you have completed the first five circuits, you have to race them again another four times - but at a much more difficult level. Manage to win all five circuits on all levels, and you win the Road Rash cup.

There are about five bikes to choose from, which are divided into three groups. Rat, Sport, and Super. You start the first level with a Rat bike, but as you proceed through the levels, it is important to pick bikes from a different bike class.

If you have no plans to win the Road Rash cup, you can choose the game's Thrash mode. The difference between this and the other mode is that there is no money involved (ie: you are not allowed to buy bikes), and you are competing against fourteen opponents. And if you wreck your bike or you get busted, you have to start all over again. Regardless of the mode you pick, you will always start in the last place.

The remake also contains FMV movies that usually depict the outcome of the races, as well as limited songs performed by various recording artists, including Soundgarden, Therapy?, Monster Magnet, and Swervedriver. These songs can be changed on-the-fly via the game's options menu.</resource>

The cruel pirate LeChuck is deeply in love with her - so deeply that he refuses to accept his own death! As a ghost, he dwells with his undead crew somewhere near the mysterious Monkey Island. You are Guybrush Threepwood, a young man whose only wish is to become a real pirate. At the Scumm Bar you meet three pirates who tell you'll have to complete three difficult tasks in order to be worthy of this title. Could Guybrush ever suspect that while trying to complete those tasks, he will encounter the governor Elaine Marley, fall in love with her, and face the anger of the dreadful ghost pirate LeChuck?! This is when Guybrush' adventure truly begins!

The Secret of Monkey Island is an adventure game that utilizes the command verb-based SCUMM interface first introduced in  Maniac Mansion: you construct commands for Guybrush by clicking on the appropriate verb, and then clicking on the inventory item or an object in the room you want to interact with. It is the first LucasArts' adventure game in which it is impossible to get irrevocably stuck or to die. The branching dialogue system, where you choose one of the available responses while talking to people, allows you to talk to characters in different ways without fearing a wrong choice. There are plenty of inventory-based puzzles to solve, and even &amp;quot;insult swordfighting&amp;quot; to participate in, where Guybrush has to prove his wit is as sharp as his sword!</resource>

You move a crosshair around the screen and shoot targets.  Occasionally, you can also choose to change directions at fixed points.

Of course the real attraction in a game like this is the story.  In the future, maybe in the year 2000, people will be forced to move underground and live in tunnels.  Unfortunately, these tunnels are infested with mutated rat / alligator creatures known as &amp;quot;ratigators.&amp;quot;  You are pilot of a Sewer Shark, a craft designed to navigate the Sewers and rid them of ratigators.  It's a dangerous job, but if you clear out enough vermin you can win a one-way trip to Solar City and sunny beaches.</resource>

It is twenty-first century, and the humanity faces a difficult period that follows devastating wars and other disasters. Magic and technology co-exist, supernatural powers, mythical creatures, ghosts, cyberspace, where hackers meet and fight each other, street deckers which can be hired to do the dirty work, anarchy and struggle between mighty and corrupt corporation - this is the world of Shadowrun. Unlike the two other Shadowrun games which are set in Seattle, according to tradition, &amp;quot;Shadowrun&amp;quot; for Sega CD is set in the futuristic Neo Tokyo. You control a party of characters with different backgrounds: the street samurai Rikudo, the shaman girl Mao, the decker (a hired mercenary) D-Head who also happens to be an elf, and Shiun, a former member of a mighty corporation. Your first assignment is to hunt down a ghostly warrior who has been disturbing the piece of the city for quite some time. As you begin your investigation, you plunge deeper into the dark work of intrigues and find yourself fighting on different fronts.

&amp;quot;Shadowrun&amp;quot; for Sega CD (unlike its two other counterparts) is a distinctly Japanese game. It is a hybrid of Japanese adventure along the lines of  Snatcher and turn-based party RPG. In adventure mode, you interact with the game world by choosing commands (&amp;quot;Look&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Talk&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Move&amp;quot;, etc.) from a menu. There are no real puzzles, but rather realistic detective work: you talk to people, gather evidence, access the internet, talk to informers, and so on. But often you find yourself in places where you navigate your characters from a top-down view and fight enemies. The battles occupy the whole screen, and you can move around the battle field, using melee, long-ranged, and magic attacks, like in early  Ultima games. The outcome of an attack is decided by a dice roll. You can stop the dices yourself, or you can let the computer do the rolling for you. There are also cyberspace fights which occur when you encounter a hostile hacker in the matrix world.</resource>

The game uses live actors and sets as the player controls Sherlock Holmes and his longtime partner Dr. Watson, trying to solve three separate crimes by visiting various locations, listening to the dialogue, reading the included mock London newspapers, and, when the player gets enough evidence, answering the judge's questions.

At the beginning of each case a full motion video clip depicts Holmes and Watson meeting a client and learning a few background clues about the case. Then the player must visit a particular location or person, read the London newspapers for clues or ask one of the young Baker Street Irregulars to investigate. The object of each case is to gather enough clues in the shortest time possible, then go before a judge who will then ask the player to answer the important questions about the case. If the player is successful, a full motion video clip will take the player back to Holmes' and Watson's study where they will review the events that transpired, and Dr. Watson will inform the player of his or her score, based on the length of time it took to solve the case.</resource>

As he proceeds further, he meets a man who is hanging on a cross, another one who is being tormented by a demon, and a mysterious young woman who is bathing in a pool...

&amp;quot;Wake up!&amp;quot; - the voice of his mother cuts through the dream. The young man wakes up and checks his computer. Suddenly, a message arrives: the world is headed towards destruction. Only he who can summon demons through a virtual space will be able to prevent a disaster. What could that mean? The young man goes outside and finds out a murder has occurred in the nearby park.

While it's mostly thought there's no Sonic-related music, The song &amp;quot;Funky Brothers&amp;quot; is actually from the unreleased arcade game, SegaSonic Bros. which was at the time, still in development. The first &amp;quot;track&amp;quot; is actually a special version of the game Teddy Boy Blues for the Mega-CD with brand new levels and allows the player to choose any of the audio tracks of the album as background music for the game.</resource>

It uses proprietary technology to allow switching from one scene to another without lag, which allows for smoother interactive video.

Gameplay is relatively simple, using little more than arrow keys, and is very different from any other basketball simulation. Basketball is merely the subject for the game's plot, involving the new-guy, Ace (the player), and a host of other characters, basketball players or just spectators, all with different personalities. It's basically play one-on-one on a warehouse court and climb the &amp;quot;ladders&amp;quot; until you earn enough respect to play against Scottie Pippen.

The game features a total of 13 characters, 5 of which the player has an option to play against, all of which are played by real actors.</resource>

Super Strike Trilogy was announced at E3 1995 and was meant to include enhanced editions of Electronic Arts' first three Strike games, Desert Strike, Jungle Strike and Urban Strike, potentially with extra content removed from their original cartridge releases due to space contraints. The disc was however cancelled for unknown reasons.

A prototype featuring the complete version of the game was dumped and released on the internet in July 2017.

Strike is a series of video games created by Mike Posehn, John Patrick Manley and Tony Barnes released between 1991 and 1997 by Electronic Arts for a number of video game systems. The games are multi-directional shooters viewed from an overhead or top-down perspective. The first three games in the series were 2D and used isometric sprites to give the illusion of 3D depth since real-time 3D polygon rendering wasn't possible at the time</resource>

The gameplay in Supreme Warrior consists of digitized video with interactive elements.  At many points during the video, you can unleash a punch, kick, or block.  If your timing is correct, you inflict damage on your opponent.  If you timing is off, your opponent hurts you.</resource>

You are the Marketing director (hit man) for one of these companies.  It is your job to take control away from the competitors.  The job is not one of diplomacy, but one of brute force and physical control.  Advance your way to the top of the corporation by successfully completing your missions and managing the money you make from your territories.

The gameplay is visually reminiscent of X-Com, with an angled top-down perspective, but it is real time rather than turn based. You have missions ranging from infiltrate and capture, to seek and destroy. In each of these you direct a team of four agents as they move through the world shooting at anything that gets in their way.

You can upgrade and modify your agents, as well as equip them with tools you have researched or liberated from opposing syndicates.  As you complete missions, you gain more funds to use for purchasing agents or researching upgrades and equipment.</resource>

The game consists of 10 levels. Future locations include the post-apocalyptic wasteland of 2029 Los Angeles and the time displacement complex. In the present of 1984, Reese must traverse the streets and rooftops of L.A., as well as the Tech Noir club, the police station, and, for the finale, an automated factory. 

Reese is armed with a gun with unlimited ammo as well as a limited number of grenades to dispatch the many enemies, including Terminators and HKs in the future and punks in the present. In addition to these, several bosses must also be fought. The boss battles include several encounters with the Terminator, who naturally cannot be completely destroyed until the finale, but must be driven back to keep him from harming Sarah.

Between levels, the game shows small digitized clips from the film that advance the storyline. The game also features a fully CD-based soundtrack with tracks ranging from heavy rock to electronic tunes.</resource>

The first task is to set up your rides within the available land, structuring convenient paths and queues and ideally leaving some space for bigger rides once they become available, and include some lakes and trees to increase the park's allure. Rides range from Teacups and Haunted Houses to the biggest most elaborate roller-coaster you can design, and water rides that loop around other rides.

Shops must also be included, so that the visitors can buy food, drinks and souvenirs - the cunning player will combine salt, sugar and caffeine settings to maximize consumer interest. Staff must be hired to keep everything running smoothly, and they will only work for what they consider a fair rate of pay.

You are competing against other Theme Parks, so don't let them get an advantage over you - monitor your success in attracting customers and financial viability closely using the supplied statistics pages. More important, ensure that research is adequately funded to produce new rides.

Set sometime in the late 20th century, when conflicts all over the world have erupted, and world peace is but a thing of the past.

As the leader of one of 16 nations, your ultimate goal is none other than world domination. To accomplish this you have a multitude of options ranging from raw military might, diplomacy, foreign or domestic investment policy, aiding terrorists or revolutionaries, to media manipulation. In other words, it's just like the real world.

The game offers 5 distinct scenarios, all of which require different strategies to win.</resource>

An enhanced port for the Sega Mega-CD was also in development at one point and was reportedly completed, but cancelled at the last minute due to its publisher, JVC, deciding to pull support for the system. Infamously Timecop was even released to the public, albeit in demo form, alongside issue #45 of Sega Pro CD - it was originally planned for issue #40, but a reluctant JVC meant that a Mickey Mania demo disc was bundled with the magazine instead.

It uses photos, animations, videos &amp; voice clips to pose over 2000 questions and answers to Trivial Pursuit questions.

In the Classic Game, up to 6 players roll an on-screen die and move their 'pie-dish' marker around the spoke-and-wheel game board, just like the board game. The square you land on is color coded to one of six trivia categories: People &amp; Places, Sports &amp; Leisure, History, Arts &amp; Entertainment, Science &amp; Nature, and Wild Card. Answering the trivia question correctly lets you take another turn.

Further, if you are on the 'prize' square at the end of each spoke (1 spoke end for each category color), the correct answer grants you a colored pie piece in your pie-dish marker for that category. Once you have all 6 pie pieces in your dish, you need to head back to the hub for a final random question to win the game.</resource>

On what is to be the day of their wedding, Castle Lorath is assaulted by the Danek, who have been able to partially reconstruct alien mecha technology from a millennium ago. The castle defenses are powerless against the giant robots, and the king and queen are killed in the attack. The invaders steal Elin in the midst of her wedding vows. Prince Sandor, now the king of the realm, sets out to rescue his betrothed, and find a way to defeat the fearsome alien technology.

The game is a thoroughly &amp;quot;old-school&amp;quot; Japanese-style RPG, meaning that the focus of the game is on fighting random enemies in turn-based combat, gaining experience and gold in process, without any additional gimmicks. The characters come with pre-set &amp;quot;classes&amp;quot; (wizard, bard, etc.), and learn their own abilities/magic spells automatically as they level up.</resource>

Due to an assortment of rare events, the spirits of the Totem have been freed and they have created a bizarre parallel universe that can devour the world. Lowman, the &amp;quot;head&amp;quot; of the Totem, needs some &amp;quot;muscle&amp;quot; as he calls it, to bring them back. He finds a pencil on the desk and makes it come to life. The pencil tells Lowman to call him Woody, WILLLLLLLLD Woody. Lowman explains what has happened with his Totem brothers and now Woody goes into the parallel universe, dimension by dimension, and rounds up Lowman's Totem brothers.

In this game, you destroy your enemies by jumping on top of them and Woody can also wipe them out with his eraser. You can erase certain walls to get through them and you can also erase boxes that most of the time teleport if you press down. Other boxes contain items. You also can sketch things and they will come to life, but you can only do this twice because Woody shrinks very quickly from doing this. There are also power-ups that make you grow again.</resource>

You're a 2nd Lieutenant just out of the Academy, with some good work under your belt. You're posted to Tiger's Claw, the flagship of the Confederation Fleet.  Will you help the Confederation to victory, or go down in infamy? 

Wing Commander is a space combat simulator interspersed with shipboard dialogs. Onboard the ship, you can save/load game, visit the bar to get the latest gossip, or go on to the next mission briefing, and the 3D space combat part. 

The 3D space combat have you sitting in the cockpit, where you control the craft like roll, turn, up/down, afterburner, as well as fire guns and launch missiles. There are four different crafts on the Confed side, each with different flight characteristics and armament. You will have a wingman on each mission, and you should keep the wingman alive as the wingman will help you if you issue the right orders. You can also taunt the enemy. You'll be fighting several different types of enemy fighters and capital ships, and even combat a few Kilrathi aces. 

When the mission is complete, land back onboard the ship and get ready for the next one. The campaign tree have both winning and losing paths. 

Wing Commander featured a hybrid bitmap/3D graphics  engine that allowed even 286's to display detailed 3D graphics to an extent never before possible. With EMS available, it can display even more detailed graphics and in-cockpit animations.</resource>

When Saul collects enough power-ups, he turns into his wolf form and gains a special psychic shot attack, which can be improved by collecting futher power-ups. However, if Saul loses health, he turns back into his human form and only has his fists to fight the numerous enemies.</resource>
