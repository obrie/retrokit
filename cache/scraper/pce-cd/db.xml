    <resource id="49f4b7adc450fecf9c7ee4b014e583572060b9ff" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">An ordinary Japanese student finds a floppy disk on the street; using his computer to load data from it, he miraculously summons Foltjunia, an intergalactic warrior who fights evil in her robotic armor with three companions. However, Foltjunia has lost her powers and as a result stays with the hero, giving him advice as to how to conquer the love of a schoolmate.

Following a brief prologue with adventure-like gameplay,  the bulk of Hatsukoi Monogatari consists of managerial simulation along the lines of Princess Maker games, though with more limited options and no RPG elements. The player manages the hero's daily schedule, divided into two segments: school and home. Activities include studying, having conversations with students or teachers, taking part-time jobs, resting, talking on the phone, shopping, buying presents, etc. Each activity increases or decreases some of the hero's parameters. The overall level can be evaluated on a special screen, and the goal is to raise it by balancing the stats with various activities.</resource>

    <resource id="b8aa469abb34d0e6d43cfbdce4beab8292e9b19c" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">A powerful wizard, yearning for even more power, has found a sacred book that granted him command over armies of demons and men. Possessed by the desire to conquer and to destroy, he orders his armies to set cities on fire, massacring the citizens. But one nameless hero, the protagonist of this game, has to stand up against the evil. Leaving Soron, his home village, the hero embarks on a journey to find companions and to face together the forces of darkness.

Despite being a Japanese game, Death Bringer is more similar to Western RPGs of the time than to their Japanese counterparts, even though it has anime-style character graphics. It is less event-oriented than Japanese games and focuses on exploration. The gameplay is somewhat similar to Pandora's RPG of the same name, even though the two games are unrelated. Both friendly and hostile areas are pseudo-3D, maze-like environments, like in Bard's Tale games. Enemy encounters, however, are handled more similarly to those of Ultima: the enemies appear on the exploration screen, and the battle initiates only if the player character approaches the enemy. The battles take place on a top-down field; the heroes and the enemies move around, but the player can't navigate the characters manually: it is only possible to issue commands such as &amp;quot;Attack&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Use Magic&amp;quot;, etc. The game has a day/night cycle. Party members (up to three, excluding the hero) have to be sought out in various cities, rather then joining the hero for plot-related reasons.</resource>

One day his sweetheart Laura gets kidnapped by an unknown villain. Van soon discovers that Laura possesses mysterious powers that may grant immortality to the one who marries her. That is exactly what the evil wizard Galam has in mind. Van sets off to rescue Laura, on a quest that involves intergalactic journeys and travel through time.

Cosmic Fantasy 2 is a sequel to Cosmic Fantasy: B?ken Sh?nen Yuu, and the only installment in the series to have been released in the West. Though initially not directly related to its predecessor story-wise, the game features several common characters and themes. 

Like the previous game, it is a Japanese-style RPG set in a mixed sci-fi and medieval world. The game has random enemy encounters and simple turn-based combat mechanics. Player-controlled characters can learn and use various offensive and healing spells; however, enemies are restricted to physical attacks. Characters join and leave the party frequently, as dictated by the plot; the party may contain up to four active combatants. Story progression and overworld exploration is linear; dungeons are usually fairly complex and maze-like. Full-screen anime-style cutscenes with voice-overs advance the story of the game.</resource>

A peace treaty was signed between them; but the governments of either side knew that sooner or later there will be war again. The scientists of Soron developed a highly advanced technique, infusing human organism with powers of spirits. Five young ladies, under the command of Jennifer Sylkis, were imbued with this augmentation, which allowed them to pilot giant combat robots. Soon the fight for galactic supremacy will begin...

Lady Phantom is a turn-based strategy game. The game consists of linear missions, which take the player to large strategic battles; the goal is usually to eliminate all enemy units, though mission objectives such as reaching a certain area or preventing a certain key character from getting killed are also present. The player commands the five combatants, choosing their equipment before each battle. The battle screen is composed of hexagons; the characters have turns depending on their agility rating. When player-controlled or enemy character attack each other, an automatic battle sequence ensues.</resource>

On board the space ship Agamemnon, they started an intergalactic journey. But an accident happened, and the humans were thrown into a parallel universe. Years have passed until they have adapted themselves to the different civilization. This parallel world, composed of three huge continents, is called Babel. Zell is a teenage boy, an orphan who lives in a post-apocalyptic world riding his bike, together with his friend Alice, who is like a big sister to him. One day they meet a mysterious girl named Sefia who seems to be on an important mission. Their struggle against evil begins at that moment...

Babel is a Japanese-style RPG set in a futuristic world. Zell and his party travel around the world, visiting large cities and encountering many randomly appearing enemies. During the turn-based battles, each character can use a variety of attacks with different weapons, as well as special techniques. The combat window shows animated moves of the party members. Unlike in most role-playing games, characters do not receive experience points from defeating enemies; only money is gained. The characters level up according to the player's progress in the narrative.</resource>

Xak: The Art of Visual Stage
Xak II: Rising of the Redmoon

The improved interface from the second game is now present during the first as well. Even though gameplay-wise this release is very similar to the originals, there are some slight changes as well: enemies are more aggressive, and sometimes appear at different spots than in the original. Although this release contains both games, they are treated as one long game, and it is only possible to start playing the second after having completed the first.</resource>

The player is presented with a board full of mahjong tiles; the goal is to match identically-looking tiles in pairs, causing them to disappear. Only tiles that have no obstacles (i.e. other tiles) on their path to each other can be matched. New tiles are added by the game on squares adjacent to the removed ones. The player must think ahead in order to complete the puzzle, avoiding unwinnable situations.

There are nine different boards, with tiles placed in different patterns of varying difficulty. In addition, there are four difficulty levels, measured by the time limit allowed for each puzzle (the easiest level has no time limit at all). Characters from the Gambler Jiko Ch?shinha manga can be asked for advice a limited number of times.</resource>

One day, his home village is attacked by a hideous spider-like monster. Kenbu's best friend and mentor dies protecting him. The young hero kills the monster, but soon thereafter has to leave the village and find out who or what was behind that attack. Kenbu encounters other heroes, and together they must stop the evil that is threatening the entire world.

Alnam no Kiba (&amp;quot;Fang of Alnam&amp;quot;) is a traditional Japanese RPG. Kenbu and his party roam the top-down world, walking on the world map, visiting towns and dungeons, and fighting random enemies in turn-based combat. The battles are viewed from the same top-down perspective as the navigation (like in Alshark). Every action in battle depletes a certain amount of spirit points. The heroes can use regular attacks, magic, and unite attacks, that do high damage to all enemies, but consume a lot of spirit points.</resource>

In the kingdom of Whistler, the best fighters are young, beautiful women, proficient in many styles of combat. Princess Minerva is one of them. She participates in a tournament, battles against the best female fighters of the country, and ultimately joins forces with them, building a super-powerful party that is bound to defeat the archenemy of the Queen of Whistler, the evil sorceress Dynastar.

The game begins where the girls are already united and are getting ready for the grand quest. Your party contains nine girls, each one with various statistics and magic spells. The large party is divided into three smaller ones, and you switch between them while participating in random battles and fighting bosses. The combat is turn-based, and is viewed from a top-down perspective, like the locations you visit. You travel on the overworld map, visit towns, and descend into dungeons. The three active girls in your party can also unite to perform combo attacks. </resource>

You take the role of a homeroom teacher who is given the responsibility of teaching five girls in their last year of high school. You determine their class schedules, do guidance counseling, interfere with their weekend plans, and occasionally take to the streets to make sure they're not getting into trouble. Each of the girls have their own individual personality and problems, and the choices you make will determine whether they graduate from high school, what they do with their lives afterwards, and whether or not they wind up hating your guts. Get them all into top colleges and your boss will praise your genius. If they all flunk or wind up wanting to marry you, you'll obviously be fired.

Despite what common sense and knowledge of the Japanese psyche might lead you to believe, this is not an adult (or hentai) game and there's no nudity and only an average amount of anime sexploitation.</resource>

Nishimura, starring Inspector Totsugawa and his assistant Kamei, who is the protagonist of the game. A man was found stabbed to death in his apartment in Tokyo; shortly after the investigation begins, another man is killed in a hotel room in Hokkaido. Kamei must question witnesses and suspects and examine evidence in order to solve the mystery.

The gameplay format is that of a Japanese adventure: the player selects verb commands (Examine, Ask, Move, Show, etc.) and combines them with people or objects to gather information and advance the plot. At certain points the interaction switches to point-and-click interface, requiring the player to carefully examine a room or an object, searching for clues. </resource>

It is set in a typical medieval fantasy setting and features traditional turn-based combat. The player controls several generals who can command up to eight different units ranging from ordinary soldiers and archers to more exotic creatures like mermen or lizards.The generals fight alongside their units, however they are much more powerful and are able to use more diverse commands than just moving and attacking, like recovering a small amount of HP or casting spells. Each unit has certain strengths and weaknesses; for example soldiers are good against archers but weak against cavalry etc. Combat is also influenced heavily by terrain types. When two units engage in combat a small animation, similar to those seen in Advance Wars or Fire Emblem, is shown.</resource>

After the evil Shameless were vanquished, peace was restored in the kingdom of Erudition; however, soon demonic forces appeared on the horizon, and two young warriors, one boy and one girl, were sent by the queen to stop them.

The quiz rules in this installment are largely the same as in the previous entry, with three or four answers to choose for each question and a time limit. The board advancement, however, is determined by choosing cards with the amount of steps written on them rather than by dot-to-dot movement of the first game. New is the two-player mode for the quest, in which the second player controls the heroine, and the two are answering questions simultaneously. A few new features, such as the possibility to acquire various bonuses before a quiz encounter, have been added. The party mode is replaced by the so-called &amp;quot;F1 Grand Prix&amp;quot;, which is a series of trivia questions where each round is presented as a Formula 1 race.</resource>

    <resource id="83edadafbfada54ef968cc72ceee18b539e521d3" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">In D?ky?sei, the player takes the role of a high-school student (default name Takurou) in a Japanese town; his parents have just moved into a large mansion in a good district. The boy has to go to the new school, but his mind is preoccupied with one subject only: pretty girls. Instead of studying hard, Takurou decides to explore the city and to find out more about its female inhabitants.

D?ky?sei is more interactive than most other Japanese adventures, utilizing point-and-click interface (with context-sensitive icons for talking, touching, etc.) and featuring free top-down navigation through the town and the school building. The hero can enter restaurants, shops, cafe houses, etc. It is also possible to take a train to another district and explore it. The game has an internal clock; a visit to any location (including separate rooms of a building, etc.) &amp;quot;costs&amp;quot; twenty minutes of the game time. 

The purpose of the game is to learn where and when the fourteen &amp;quot;datable&amp;quot; girls usually are. Many of the conversations with the girls feature multiple answers; the success in many cases depends on the player's choices.

The game has scenes with nudity and explicit sexual situations.</resource>

In the beginning of the game, the player views the statistics of each girl and her personality description. Afterwards, the training begins. Most of the game is spent planning schedules for the girls. Practicing music skills, working, having a vacation - everything has an influence on the girls' statistics. It is important to keep the girls happy and reduce their stress; at the same time, having vacations without practicing will diminish their professional skill. Keeping the right balance is the key here.

After a period of training, the player chooses which specific branch he/she wants the girls to compete in: commercial photos (model), staging a musical, performing a pop concert, making a movie, etc. Depending on the player's preparations and previous training, the girls will get higher or lower ratings. The player-controlled group competes against other agencies in a league, and results are shown after each major event.</resource>

It seems he can now finally enjoy a peaceful time with his beloved girl. But one day, his old friend Ches, a cute cat-like fairy girl, appears in his room and summons him to the world of gods. It appears that Venus, the goddess of love, is in trouble due to the unforeseen events that have led to the outbreak of the Trojan war. Wataru is about to begin another adventure in the world of gods and ancient cultures.

Cal III is a Japanese-style adventure with visual novel characteristics. The player interacts with characters and is given several dialogue options or actions to choose from. There is no other interaction with the environment, and the progress is strictly linear. Most choices are optional, and only a few lead to Game Over. The computer versions of the game contain a few scenes with nudity, but overall the sexual content is by far milder than in the predecessors.</resource>

It puts the player into a position of a high school teacher, whose goal is to successfully lead five female students to graduation within the same semester. In order to do that, the player has to study the individual characteristics of the girls. Each girl has different parameters, different strengths and weaknesses. The teacher should be careful not to overload the students with work, but letting them do what they want is not the right way either. The teacher has also control on other aspects of the students' life: it is possible to have personal conversations with the girls to motivate them, and choose leisure activities for them (such as going to the cinema). The girls can become displeased with the teacher or sick, so it's important to keep the morale high in order to achieve successful graduation.</resource>

While retaining the story, the graphical style, and the basic location layout of the computer version, this release has substantial gameplay differences.

Unlike in the computer version, the battles are not real-time, but turn-based, and utilize a different perspective; randomly encountered enemies are fought in a first-person, Dragon Quest-like traditional Japanese RPG style. Enemy design is also quite different; many of the monsters from the original version have been replaced with female characters. The graphics in the top-down areas have been slightly enhanced.

This version also censors the adult content. The scenes are still suggestive, but there is no explicit nudity in them any more. Some of the cutscenes have been completely re-drawn, eliminating even implicit sexual activity.</resource>

Kishi is a Japanese-style role-playing game based on the setting and themes of the card game Monster Maker and its subsequent table RPG incarnation. The player takes control of a young girl named Raia, who finds out that she belongs to the race of half-elves. Blamed for attacks on her village, she is expelled from her homeland and sets off on a journey to find out the truth about her origins.

The game follows the traditional template of the genre and has top-down overworld navigation, towns and dungeons, party management, simple leveling-up, weapons and armor to equip, and randomly appearing enemies that engage the party in turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective. Magic can be bought in shops, though some characters come with pre-learned spells. Later in the game the player gains the ability to communicate with monsters and summon them during battles.</resource>

GunBuster Vol.2 is a direct sequel to the first episode based on the Gunbuster anime series. It continues the story started in the first chapter, following the adventures of the young mecha pilot Noriko Takaya as she passes the test and is admitted into the fighting squad of mechas, sent on a mission to stop an insectoid race of aliens from destroying the Earth.

Gameplay-wise, the second episode differs from the previous one in that it eschews even the rudimentary Japanese-style adventure commands. It plays more like a pure interactive movie: the player watches animated, voiced scenes and from time to time has to make a decision for Noriko, influencing subsequent scenes. The &amp;quot;stress meter&amp;quot; from the preceding game has been removed as well. The game also contains extras such as character and robot introduction, a radio drama, and a &amp;quot;rock-paper-scissors&amp;quot; game against Noriko.</resource>

The game follows the same formula laid out by its predecessors and alternates between fighting and exploring. The first part gets Sadler to walk around towns, talk to villagers or purchase new equipment. The fighting phases are classic hack-and-slash action scenes set in countless hostile locations - there the player fight enemies, bosses and earn precious experience points and gold coins.</resource>

You can play in two campaigns against the computer which requires you to defeat the enemy wizards on all maps and allows you to take all units that have survived a battle into the next one. You can also play all maps individually with up two four human players. In battles, you can summon different monsters and cast spells. Which monsters you can summon and which spells you can use depends on which wizard you have chosen. Your aim in every battle is to defeat all other wizards and thus conquering the land (In the campaigns you only have a limited number of turns to do so).

    <resource id="e1f9fd89549db3ee77441e5ff23f5f990072f27e" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">After L'Kbreth's Orb was used to bring peace back to the land of Llylgamyn, a new threat emerges in the region. Strange malevolent energies have been spotted beneath the Temple of Sages. These energies - called the &amp;quot;Maelstrom&amp;quot; by the local inhabitants - can be sealed by a person known as the Gatekeeper. Unfortunately, the latter has been imprisoned by a mysterious power or person only referred to as SORN. A party of brave adventurers seeks out the high priest G'bli Gedook, the guardian of L'Kbreth's Orb, who explains to them that they have to release the Gatekeeper and eventually vanquish the evil at its core.

Wizardry V: Heart of the Maelstrom returns to the gameplay concept of the first three installments of the series, abandoning the unusual premise of its predecessor. As in the initial games, the gameplay consists of exploring a vast maze-like dungeon with a custom party created and outfitted in the game's only town. Though visually very similar to their predecessors, the game's dungeon is no longer limited to a square layout. Several tweaks have been applied to the gameplay system, including range rating for all weapons (allowing back row attacks), a more prominent role for the Thief class (who can now hide in shadows, backstab enemies, and open locks), etc.

The game is more puzzle-oriented than the preceding entries, requiring the player to obtain a larger quantity of crucial items needed for its completion. It is the first installment in the series with friendly NPCs who can be encountered in the dungeon and interacted with by typing keywords. Also for the first time, the game allows - but does not require - importing characters from a previous scenario.</resource>

    <resource id="5def0b6126c871601a76ab5f0feacd012062acfe" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Super Schwarzschild is a spin-off entry in the Schwarzschild series. The game's scenario is based on that of Schwarzschild II. The story is much more elaborate and character-specific; unlike the earlier game, there is a linear plot advanced through dialogue and anime-style cutscenes. The player takes control of Alcion, the crown prince of the Auraclume kingdom, who is forced to terminate his studies abroad and return to his country in order to defend it against a treacherous enemy.

The gameplay system is vastly different as well; as opposed to the main entries in the series, Super Schwarzschild is not a grand strategy game. The gameplay is confined to much smaller areas and is also significantly more linear and mission-oriented. Rather than presenting free-form gameplay and interaction with a multitude of nations, the game is restricted to a single military conflict.</resource>

Like other Schwarzschild games, it is set in the 40th century and portrays a complex political and military situation within a star system. The events of the game take place in or around the once powerful kingdom of Istramu, which was severely weakened by the king's death. Temporary leaders replaced each other, and the instability led to a global revolt in the surrounding space. The player takes the role of various characters belonging to the resistance movement.
Like the previous game, Super Schwarzschild has less grand strategy elements than the main Schwarzschild installments, and focuses on smaller-scale military strategy and tactics. There are no diplomacy options; resource management and research are simplified. There are more belligerents and somewhat more freedom in strategic planning than in the preceding game.</resource>

The aim is to escort your little buddy across the vast playing area without him getting stuck, burned up, eaten by sheep etc. To do this, you can pick up and move various items that are scattered around the landscape, such as blocks to fill in gaps or create handy slopes, bombs to destroy areas of the map and so on. All this time your red headed friend is moving forward with alarming rapidity towards his doom. Thankfully, you can freeze the action to give yourself some breathing space to juggle things around, but this is limited to a timer which counts down slowly at the top of the screen.</resource>

The prince was imprisoned, but managed to break free, kidnap Valna, the queen of Vecanti, and install himself as the Dream Land's new ruler. Cham, the leader of the resistance against Galgear, hears the voice of Yuko, the former Valis soldier who has now become a goddess, telling her that one of the resistance members, a girl named Lena, is the heir to the Valis sword. Lena and her sister Amu decide to rescue Valna and find a way to stop Galgear.

Like its predecessors, Valis IV is an action platformer. It is similar to the previous game in allowing the player to control three different characters: Lena, Amu, and Asfal. Each of the characters wields a unique weapon (Valis sword for Lena, boomerang for Amu, and lance trident for Asfal) and has access to their own elemental spells (thunder for Lena, fire for Amu, ice for Asfal). Each one also has a special ability: Lena can slide through narrow passages, Amu can double-jump, and Asfal is immune to certain traps. Along with recovery and spell-enhancing (up to three levels) items, characters can also acquire special spheres that increase the overall count of their hit- and magic points.</resource>

    <resource id="27eb24ff6bf8e136d1e57674069b9792d8af1567" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">In this game, the player is cast into the roles of Sherlock Holmes, the greatest fictional detective of all times, and his friend and partner Dr. Watson, as they have to investigate and successfully solve three criminal cases:
The Mummy's Curse deals with the horrifying death of three men, which were apparently murdered by an ancient mummy;

The Mystified Murderess involves a woman who has been convicted for murdering her beloved one, but cannot seem to recall anything of what had happened to her;

The Tin Soldier concerns the murder of an old general, whose past must be investigated in order to find the killer.Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective can be described as a hybrid of adventure game and simulation. Gameplay process involves traveling to various locations in London, interrogating suspects, gathering clues, checking out the newspapers, and eventually presenting all the evidence to the judge; if the latter finds the circumstances incriminating, he will accept the results of the investigation, and the case will be considered solved. Though the basic gameplay is rather typical for adventure games, the amount of real detective work and the focus of the game on purely case-related actions rather than exploration and manipulation of items makes it comparable to a simulation of a criminal investigation.

The game is notable for being one of the earliest &amp;quot;multimedia&amp;quot; titles, having been released on a CD ROM and featuring rather long (though windowed) video sequences with live actors as introductions and cutscenes, which frequently occur when the heroes investigate suspects.</resource>

Sangokushi is a turn-based historical strategy game set during the Sengoku period of the Japanese history. The player can take control of one of the three prominent warlords of the era: Uesugi Kenshin, H?j? Ujiyasu, or Takeda Shingen. Each warlord initially controls a province with several towns, and tries to win over territory by diplomatic or military means. Every turn the player has a limited amount of moves at his or her disposal; every general has his own options, though some (e.g. marriage) are restricted to the main warlord himself.

Each town has to survive and raise reputation by maintaining an army and keeping the population happy. This is achieved by trading (buying and selling rice), giving money to civilians or soldiers, developing the town, etc. Every general can also strike alliances with rulers of other provinces, sign agreements, and send spies. 

When an area controlled by a general is invaded by the enemy, the game switches into a top-down turn-based tactical battle mode. The player positions and navigates soldiers, engaging in automatic battles when the opponents meet on adjacent squares. Castle invasion and defense can be carried out through various means: for example, it is possible to send an assassin to dispose of the enemy general, or assign archers to fend off the invaders from castle walls.</resource>

This same hero then was charged by the heavens to take care of young seed dropped from there. This seed becomes his daughter, and her guardian will be watching her progress.

In Princess Maker 2 the player assumes the role of a father to the blessed daughter of the heavens. For the next eight years, the hero will nurture and guide her in the path of the player's own choosing.

It is possible to choose the path of the zodiac-influenced daughter by scheduling her to jobs and schools, which will raise her statistics (strength, combat skills, cooking, faith, etc.) Each month allows the player to designate three different tasks for her to follow. Balancing between character development, stress level, health and financial income is the focus of this game.

Mini sub-quests and various plot options revolve around  the young lady adventuring in the wilderness, provided that she's strong enough to tame the wilds. The player can equip her with armor and weapons to fight off wandering random monsters in turn-based combat.

The game starts with the daughter at age ten, from which point the player guides her until her adult years. Choices made during the course of the game will determine her eventual marital status, accomplishments and her relationships with other people. There are 74 unique endings in the game.</resource>

You are a noble warrior who has just saved your kingdom from an invasion by the terrible Demon Lord. The grateful king offers you to choose any reward you wish for your brave deed. But instead of opting for half of the kingdom or the riches of the land, you ask the king for the permission to raise a poor little orphan girl named Maria. 

And so the game begins. You are the one who has to build Maria's future. Of course, you can do it in many ways. You can strive to make a real princess out of her, teach her good manners, study arts, to make her a brave fighter like yourself, or just a lazy bimbo who cares for nothing. Her destiny is in your hands!</resource>

The game attempts to realistically simulate golf and contains many features and variables that influence gameplay. There are two modes in the game: Normal and Tournament. In the normal mode up to four players can compete against each other or computer opponent in stroke play, match play, driving range, and putting green. Real Japanese golf courses are available for selection, complete with digitized photos and introductions. The player can select to control Japanese golfers and choose between a variety of clubs, as well as manually influence the shot, controlling force, angle, and the exact part of the ball the player wishes to strike.

The Tournament mode is essentially a managerial simulation game. The player takes control of a golfer in an unnamed city. The goal is to accumulate enough currency and fame, as well as increase personal attributes of the golfer in order to participate in tournaments. Currency is obtained by doing part-time jobs, e.g. as a caddie in golf matches, or by gambling at slot machines. The player can also visits shops to purchase clubs and other golfing equipment. There is an in-game schedule that keeps track of tournaments and also incorporates random events (such as accidents). It is also possible to send the golfer on a vacation when he is too tired from working or practicing golf.</resource>

The show consists of short episodes which are depictions of comical situations, and are not related to each other story-wise. Same can be applied to the game: there is no real story, just a stretch of hilarious and intentionally impossible situations the protagonists find themselves in.</resource>

 a simple game, in which the player has to press the correct buttons in time to match the movements of a girl on the screen;
a quiz game; the player has to choose the correct answers to various Sailor Moon-related questions within a time limit; 
 a butt-pushing game (for lack of a better term), in which the player, controlling one of the heroines, has to push another one off a narrow stage with the aforementioned body part of the player character.</resource>

    <resource id="0ed2741b03192c17c01f582c741cd24f5a4b8934" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">It was just an ordinary cruise ship gig for the four musicians. The band leader, known only as the Flute (the player names him and the other heroes before the game begins), never thought that it will end in such a way... Suddenly, a tornado engulfed the ship, and the poor musician found himself in the magical world populated by angelic creatures and monsters! Naturally, this world, called Astralius by its inhabitants, needs salvation. Only the Magic Flute can avert a demonic threat. Apparently, our hero is the only flutist in all the dimensions, since it is now his task to take the unlikely role of a noble paladin, find other musicians to help him on his quest, and show everyone that music can, indeed, save the world!

Despite the somewhat unusual choice of protagonists, Mateki Densetsu Astralius is quite an &amp;quot;old-school&amp;quot; Japanese-style RPG. The player controls the nameless flutist and other musicians (trumpet player, drummer, etc.), who later join the party, exploring the top-down world, visiting towns to buy weapons, armor, and items, descending into dungeons, automatically leveling up, progressing the story in a linear fashion, and fighting randomly appearing enemies in turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective. Casting magic spells is called &amp;quot;performing&amp;quot; in the game, though it requires magic points, like in other games of this kind. Those magic points must be bought in special shops.

Unlike most other PC Engine (TurboGrafx) CD RPGs, there are no voice overs or animated cut scenes in this game.</resource>

The player controls a fan who gets to meet Noriko and subsequently takes her on a date.

The gameplay mostly involves occasionally choosing actions when prompted; most of these are reduced to right and wrong choices, the latter sometimes leading to a Game Over. In certain cases the player can also decide a location to visit with Noriko; other locations may become inaccessible following the player's choice. Sometimes the player participates in simple mini-games, e.g. taking Noriko's photos or playing rock-paper-scissors with her.</resource>

The Time Machine mode involves traveling to different time periods and answering trivia questions in order to trigger famous events (e.g. Moses creating a path through the Red Sea for the Jews, the belligerents of the Three Kingdoms era attacking each other, apple falling on Sir Isaac Newton's head, etc.). The questions themselves, however, have usually nothing to do with the historical event in question. 

Another mode in the game is called &amp;quot;Megaten Quest&amp;quot;; however, it is not a Megami Tensei related quiz, but rather an imitation of a first-person dungeon crawler with randomly appearing enemies who ask the player a certain number of question on various themes. The third mode follows the same quiz format with correctly answered questions leading to puzzle solutions, and is essentially the multiplayer portion of the game. In all modes, time limit is imposed on the entire round rather than on separate questions.</resource>

Tokimeki Memorial is a dating simulation game. There is a schedule in the game, which includes school-related and free-time activities. The player characters has various statistics that can be raised by performing certain activities (such as studying to increase intelligence, etc.). The gameplay is dedicated almost entirely to planning schedules, getting the maximum out of the date with the chosen girl. A date is not necessarily automatic success - neglecting a girl for a long time will lead to gossip and eventually may destroy the relationship. There is also a &amp;quot;rival&amp;quot; in the game, a male student who might succeed with one of the girls if the player is not careful enough.</resource>

There, he is greeted by a cute bunny-eared girl named Vanilla (perhaps it should have been Bunnyla, but we'll never know), who says she is the guardian of the portal, and if he wants to return home, he'll have to defeat her and the other guardians in the game of mahjong!

The game has two modes: story mode, which puts the player against Vanilla and advances the story after mahjong rounds; and battle mode, which allows the player to choose between three cute female opponents, and also change some of the game's rules.</resource>

    <resource id="548b7f2906fd039bc1ee5ffe7a05ff002e163c84" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">While the Sultan of Persia is fighting a war in a foreign country, his Grand Vizier Jaffar orchestrates a coup d'état. His way to the throne lies through the Sultan's lovely daughter. Jaffar kidnaps her and threatens to kill her if she refuses to marry him. Meanwhile, the man the Princess loves is thrown into the dungeon. He has only one hour to escape from his prison, defeat the guards on his way, and stop Jaffar before the terrible marriage takes place.

Prince of Persia is a 2D platformer that is commonly regarded as a progenitor of the cinematic platform genre. Rather than following the more common jump-and-run mechanics, it focuses on careful advancement through fairly complex levels, emphasizing the protagonist's vulnerability and survival aspect. Rotoscoping technique is used to give more realism to the animation of the characters' movements.

The protagonist must avoid deadly traps, solve some simple jumping and environmental puzzles (such as stepping on pressure plates to raise portcullis), and engage in sword fights with the guards. The player character has an infinite amount of lives, but has to restart at the beginning of a level each time he dies, and must complete the game within an hour. The hero starts with three units of health, which can be replenished with small health potions or permanently increased with large jars.

The Game Boy Color and SNES versions of the game feature additional levels and new enemies. The Genesis version has a new intro, an altered set of graphics and four new levels.</resource>

This is a horizontal fighting game, where you basically take one of the three characters (the barbarian Ax Battler, a dwarf named Gilius Thunderhead or the amazon Tyris Flare) and bash everything which stands between you and Death Adder himself. Each character has a special magical ability that can be charged by kicking small blue creatures that drop a potion. There is also a green variety off this creature that drops food that replenishes your health. Some enemies ride dragons and a scorpion like creature. The enemies can be knocked off and you can mount the creature yourself and attack the enemies with it.

The game allows to play up to two players on a same screen, however in the C64 version this option has not been implemented. C64 version was also stripped off in the other areas, such as: only one enemy can engage the player at a time or there are only two types of dragons instead of three.</resource>

The player controls a car from an &amp;quot;into the screen&amp;quot; 3rd person perspective, racing through the 17 pseudo-3D courses (named after various geographical locations, e.g. &amp;quot;West Coast&amp;quot; etc.). There are other cars on the road, which can slow down the player-controlled car by colliding with it, but the race is against time rather than against these cars. The player is given a time limit for each course, and an indicator shows how close the car is to the completion. Should the car run out of time, the race is lost, and the player has to replay it before tackling the next one.

The car can be controlled with two buttons only; collisions do not damage the car, but merely make it stop; though the player can change a car model and gear system, no realistic gear-based driving is used in the game. All this contribute to the overall arcade feeling of the races.</resource>

The available playing modes are exhibition match (either single or double), training, the Davis Cup or the four Grand Slam tournaments. The player either controls one of the 32 available tennis athletes or creates a new one. Then there are 30 points to divide between abilities (e.g. forehand or volleys). This athlete can be saved to disk and further improved during the course of time.
For exhibition matches, the opponent can be built the same way.

The game includes various hit types, depending on the player's position and timing. The direction of the ball can also be influenced when performing a shot. There are four different surfaces, influencing the gameplay, and three difficulty levels.</resource>

Anarchy reigned, different military organizations fighting each other in a new war for dominance. One of such organizations eventually seized control of the planet, establishing itself as a tyrannic government and using advanced technology for military purposes. Only a lone pilot can save humanity from their clutches...

Avenger is a vertically-scrolling shooter, in which the player navigates a plane through levels populated by hostile planes, tanks, cannons, ships, stationary devices, and massive boss enemies. Before each mission, the player can choose among different weapons in three categories: main, sub, and special. Main and sub weapons are fired simultaneously and have unlimited ammunition, while the powerful special attacks are accessed by pressing a different button and are limited. The player can try any combination of the three categories, for example enhancing the main rocket launcher with a pod that fires laser to the sides as a sub weapon, and a protective shield as a special one. Power-ups change properties rapidly, so the player has to catch them at a specific time to enhance either main, sub, or special weapon. Those power-ups do not change the properties of a weapon, but rather give it additional fire power.</resource>

    <resource id="01ed716cdf17340a170080d6c50bbf1d5d8da35d" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Psychic Storm is a vertically scrolling shoot-em-up in which the player takes the role of four characters who must protect Neo Hong Kong City from an assault by vicious insectoid aliens. The player can select any of the four characters before each stage. The characters are distinguished by the unique attacks of their ships: Alex uses a vulcan gun, Charr has short-ranged &amp;quot;psychic&amp;quot; beam, Joe has a slow, yet powerful Hell Flame attack, and Nastasia uses ion laser. Each character can also acquire additional weapons by picking regular power-ups.

The game's stand-out feature, however, is its transformation mode. Each of the characters can transform to a larger and much more powerful biomechanical insect-like ship. The transformation can be performed at any time as long as the correspondent bar, which refills itself over the time, is not empty. The bar is reduced rapidly when the character is transformed; special power-ups can be collected from vanquished enemies to extend it temporarily, but once it is depleted the character transforms back to his or her normal form.</resource>

Pachio-kun: Warau Uch? is a pachinko game with a storyline and limited top-down exploration.

    <resource id="cc3bf2f55cb293895cb46cc90e727c3147f9d49b" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Long time ago, humans lived in a paradise, the Garden of Eden. But the brave and audacious members of the Fire Clan were banned from Eden, and had to seek shelter on the Earth. They built their own paradise - the land they later called Jipang. However, the evil demon lord Masakado wanted to destroy Jipang, and the Fire Clan fought and defeated him. Now, many years later, a young thief named Ziria learns that he is a descendant of the Fire Clan. He must now find the other members, and prevent the resurrection of Masakado by his followers.

Loosely based on the Japanese folk tale of the ninja Jiraiya, Tengai Maky?: Ziria was the first role-playing game released on a CD ROM; thanks to the medium's greater storage capacity, the game was able to include full-screen anime-style cutscenes with voice-overs. It is the first entry in the Tengai Maky? series, and is generally considered the first RPG with significant humorous content. The game's setting parodies many aspects of feudal Japan, containing comical and sometimes deliberately stereotypical portrayals of characters and plenty of supernatural elements.

Basic gameplay mechanics follow a template introduced in early Dragon Quest and Phantasy Star games. The player navigates Ziria and other characters who eventually join him on a top-down overworld, visiting towns to rest and buy supplies, and facing randomly appearing enemies in round-based combat viewed from first-person perspective. Each character uses his or her own unique weapon and equipment types. Magic spells cannot be bought or learned automatically when leveling up; they must be sought out in specific locations, often those not required to visit in order to advance the story. 

The game's overworld is fairly vast, divided into provinces, each containing several towns and other locations. It is possible to teleport instantly from the world map to any previously visited province.The game emphasizes overworld exploration; dungeons tend to be smaller and less maze-like than in many other contemporary role-playing games. In towns, the player can gamble and deposit money in banks; this money is preserved if the party is annihilated in combat and transported back to the town, with the money it was carrying cut in half. When a character levels up, his or her hit points (HP) and magic points (MP) are fully restored.</resource>

One day, a fellow analyst pays him an unexpected visit and directs him towards a mysterious old man named Kamiya. Reading the old man's mind, Furuyagi ventures into the realm of memories, where a woman's ghost is attempting to avenge her own murder.

Aya is the third installment of the Psychic Detective series. Like in the previous entries, it is a Japanese-style adventure game with first-person view and menu-based interaction and navigation. Commands such as &amp;quot;Look&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Ask&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Move&amp;quot; must be used on most screens in order to advance the plot. Talking to characters and contemplating about the case play an important role.</resource>

    <resource id="d07a2d930aee23b5d352974b74a9cbb6034f7efb" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Based on the manga Yawara! A Fashionable Judo Girl, the game follows the story of Yawara Inokuma, the teenage granddaughter of a famous judo master. While she is trying to have an ordinary life, her grandfather insists on her studying the martial art of judo, and she has troubles to decide what her goal in life is going to be. The game's protagonist is one of the minor characters in the manga, a young journalist named Matsuda. Seeing how Yawara effortlessly beats up an assailant on the street, Matsuda decides to find out who the &amp;quot;wonder girl&amp;quot; is, feeling that she is going to become a famous sports star.

The game is what is commonly known as digital comic, i.e. Japanese-style adventure game without puzzles and with very limited, basic interaction possibilities. Typically, the player is presented with a few verb commands and object sub-menus at every screen, and has to go through them in order to make progress. Animated and voiced cutscenes frequently occur in order to advance the narrative.</resource>

    <resource id="47a63b58a1fbd09e3b50a1fb63fc706744e9ca45" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">The Dawn of Ys is one of two games released under the title of Ys IV, the other being Tonkin House's Ys IV: Mask of the Sun. The two games share the same basic story, but have many differences regarding concrete events, locations, gameplay details, etc. The events of the game take place a short while after those described in Ys II, and before the events of Ys III: Wanderers from Ys.

As the game begins, Adol and his friend return to the town of Minea, where the first game began. The evil Lord Darm has been defeated, and it's time to relax and spend some time with friends - but not for long. A new evil is rising, and Adol decides to set sail for the overseas land of Celceta to investigate these occurrences.

Ys IV returns to the style of play used in the first and second games. The gameplay area is viewed from a top-down perspective, and the player attacks enemies by running into them to cause damage. Combat is slightly more sophisticated than in the first two games, since Adol can now move in eight directions, and attacking enemies diagonally or from the sides is more efficient than bumping into them headstrong. Adol gains experience from defeating enemies, which serves to raise his attack and defense power, like in the previous games. He can equip various swords, armor, shields, and rings to enhance his attributes. The magic system introduced in Ys II is also brought back for this game.</resource>

Cobra is a brave renegade space pirate who fights the evil Pirate Guild and helps innocent people, cruising from planet to planet in his spaceship, aided by his trusty companion, the cyborg girl Lady. The adventure starts on a space station near the planet Eldo. The ancient civilization of this planet has long been destroyed, but the unusually beautiful light that surrounds the place attracts tourists from all over the galaxy. Cobra notices that a suspicious man watches his every step. Before long he realizes that his ship is under attack. Who is after Cobra? Will he be able to survive? That's what you have to find out!

Cobra is a Japanese-style adventure. You select commands from a menu (such as &amp;quot;Look&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Talk&amp;quot;, etc.), thus interacting with people and objects. In certain places you can also move your character, viewed from third person perspective. Being one of the first games to use CD ROM format, &amp;quot;Cobra&amp;quot; features anime-style cutscenes as well as voice-overs for some dialogues.</resource>

Kearu realizes that this kidnapping was not accidental, and had something to do with Krea's mysterious origin.

Tenshi no Uta is a traditional Japanese-style role-playing game. As in most games of this genre, the player navigates the party of heroes on the top-down world map, fighting randomly appearing enemies, gaining experience for further automatic leveling-up, and money to buy better weapons, armor, and items. The battles are viewed from first-person perspective, with the enemy graphics super-imposed on the exploration screen (like in  Cosmic Fantasy 2). The game has the conventional HP and MP bars, with the heroes learning various attack, support, and healing spells as dictated by their level.

There is a day and night cycle in the game. Shops are closed at night, and certain characters appear only at a specific day time.</resource>

One day, during such a patrol, Fate and his friend Shion encounter a mysterious girl in the nearby tower. She could only remember that her name was Rhianna, but nothing else about her origins and how she ended up being in that tower. Shortly afterwards, the village is attacked by monsters and burnt down. Fate, Shion, and Rhianna escape, and Fate promises Rhianna that he will help her regain her memory and find the truth about her past.

Tenshi no Uta II: Datenshi no Sentaku is not directly related to its  predecessor story-wise (though it is set in the same universe, and some characters from the previous game make an appearance here). Graphically and gameplay-wise, it is nearly identical to it, with the exception of a few minor tweaks (such as characters regaining full health after level up): an archetypal Japanese-style RPG with random enemies, turn-based combat, linear story progression, and automatic character growth. Like the first game, Datenshi no Sentaku has a day and night cycle. </resource>

There, she must first protect the inhabitants of a peaceful town from goblin onslaught, and ultimately find a way to return to the real world. 

Despite the top-down view and the fact it was developed y the same  company who have brought us distinguished Turbo CD RPGs such as  Cosmic Fantasy series and  Babel, Meiky? no Elfeane is not a RPG, but an adventure - Japanese-style, with minimum puzzles. Most of the gameplay involves running around and talking to various inhabitants of the fairy world. There are also mini-games: a  Pac-Man-like game with cars, a vertically scrolling shoot-em-up, a  Breakout clone, and a quiz show.</resource>

The first is essentially a single-player mode; the championship allows players to compete against each other, with topics randomly chosen; the cup works like any comparable sports event, including elimination rounds.</resource>

A demon has kidnapped a girl from a peaceful village, and the elders send a boy named Gengor? to bring her back, defeating the demon's minions using his intelligence and knowledge. The game has a pseudo-RPG structure, with top-down navigation, overworld, towns, dungeons, treasure chests, random and boss &amp;quot;battles&amp;quot;, etc. However, real RPG elements are very light in the game: there is no leveling up, and the protagonist's health increases automatically following a plot-dictated boss encounter.

The core of the gameplay are the trivia &amp;quot;battles&amp;quot; against randomly appearing characters. Each &amp;quot;enemy&amp;quot; will ask the hero one question in a variety of topics (English language, geography, popular culture, etc.). Answering the question correctly within the time limit will &amp;quot;kill&amp;quot; the enemy, while giving a wrong answer will reduce the hero's HP by one point. Boss enemies offer a choice of topics and take several correct answers to defeat. A few items can be used to restore HP, reduce the time limit, return to a town, etc.</resource>

The game mechanics are based on Daisenryaku II, but many of the included maps are unique to this release, including several based on Phantasy Star in Sega's console version. There is no campaign mode, and any of the included maps can be played. Some maps are for two players, some for four, and any map can be played with any combination of human and computer players. The computer versions also feature an editor.
The game is played on a large map made up of hexagonal spaces, each of which consists of one of the included terrain types. Each player controls a number of units (bought with money), which each take up one space on the grid. The unit types are for the most part based on real-life military equipment from around the time the game was released, what is available to the player depends on the chosen faction.</resource>

    <resource id="ada0f5f847075ac0e06b0b9753e02bf8d0495b51" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">The boy Rhun and the girl Melvy live in a quiet forest village, both studying the art of magic. They enjoy a peaceful life, learning the secrets of the spirits and magical creatures populating the area. But on one fateful night, everything changes. A horde of goblins invades the village, burning it down. And it looks like the local church is in cohorts with a powerful demon bent on destruction! Before the heroes can realize what is happening, they are forced to escape into the forest, with only their magical powers at their side...

Magicoal is a &amp;quot;pseudo-RPG&amp;quot;, i.e. an action-adventure with some minor RPG elements (money, items, etc.), but without an experience system of any kind. It can be played in two-player cooperative mode, controlling Rhun and Melvy, or as a single-player game, choosing one of them and letting the computer AI control the other. The player(s) can switch between the two at any time.

Most of the game is dedicated to exploring top-down areas populated by enemies, and dealing with them in action-based combat, primarily relying on magical spells. While some of the spells have unlimited use, others must be &amp;quot;refilled&amp;quot; with special items found or dropped by the enemies. Rhun and Melvy learn spells unique to each character, of various elemental affinities and general usage (offensive, support, etc.). Money can be collected from enemies as well and then used in shops to buy items.</resource>

The world can be navigated screen by screen, by clicking the mouse where you want to go. Many objects on each screen can be clicked to find hidden animations and sounds. Exploring the completely open world, you can listen to and have educational conversations with Mr. Rabbit, Mr. Dragon, and others.

The Manhole is aimed at children, and focuses on exploration and experimentation. There is no progress to be made, no goal to be reached, and the player can not fail. The entire world is accessible from the start.

The original Macintosh version consists of six black-and-white stacks for the Macintosh's HyperCard software. Ports to other systems added color graphics.</resource>

Tantei Divan is a follow-up to Jantei Monogatari, though it can be hardly considered a true sequel because of its entirely new setting and themes. Set in a sci-fi environment, the game casts the player in the role of Divan, a young man who possesses the ability to transform into a powerful supernatural being, and is entrusted by military authorities to protect Earth against an alien demonic attack. This can be done only by defeating the evil minions in mahjong games.

Though featuring elements of a Japanese-style adventure game (verb commands that must be selected from a menu to trigger the next scene), the game focuses on mahjong matches against opponents, which occur as dictated by the plot. The game uses standard mahjong rules, with the exception of bonus powers that can be acquired for points distributed after each round and used in subsequent matches.</resource>

Gameplay-wise, this version differs from the computer releases significantly. Though it has six stages that end with the same boss enemies, its level design, layout, and many regular enemies are different. This release also completely removes two key gameplay features of the computer version: the ability to equip different weapons and armor, and the flying side-scrolling shooter stages. </resource>

The characters are taken from other Laser Soft games, most prominently Cosmic Fantasy series. The amount of moves is determined by dice roll. Special fields would award the character that lands on them with large amounts of money, the opportunity to roll the dice again, or lead to various mini-games which would increase the character's possessions. Another type of fields leads to a store run by the cat Nyan from Cosmic Fantasy games, who offers special cards for money.</resource>

Humans are attempting to harvest the resources of the entire solar system but have met with trouble from alien invaders. It is up to a small force of humans who recognize and understand the threat to confront the aliens head on.

Players use large robotic Cybernetic Anthropomorphized Machines (C.A.M) to fights 1-on-1 against alien robots across various planets and moons around the solar system.

The game has 4 different modes; story, exhibition, tournament and league battles.</resource>

But, ever-present, beneath the veneer of tranquility, evil lurks. Evil, which spurns prosperity and disdains peace.

Gather they did, those who wished to summon the powers of darkness and cleanse the decadence of the world. And, with smiling countenance, they anxiously awaited the coming of their era.

A hundred years had past, and he was resurrected. Able to become bat, wolf, or mist at will, he lived in the night. He drank the blood of young maidens and lived an eternal life. The lord of Castlevania, the god of evil, Count Dracula was reborn.</resource>

Both games feature some re-drawn artwork and remixed soundtrack, as well as voice-overs that were not present in the computer versions. The protagonists' names have been changed to Naoki Muraoka (Sotsugy? Shashin) and Tetsuya Watanabe (Miki).

While the gameplay of Miki remains largely unchanged, this version of Sotsugy? Shashin allows the player to choose Hiromi Kamura as the protagonist, which adds a second scenario to the game where the same events are presented from her point of view. The gameplay system has underwent a few tweaks, making some of the player's choices influence the course of the story. While the original game only had one ending, this version has seven endings for Naoki's scenario and ten for Hiromi's.</resource>

The manager then makes schedules for the players, which include training sessions of varying difficulty. It is also possible to change the manager's mood, which leads to different results depending on the team's spirit and personality. The player can advance the time by one day, one week, or until the next event, e.g. a test in the school or a game against another team.</resource>

Ys III: Wanderers from Ys breaks away from the &amp;quot;bumping into enemies&amp;quot; battle system of the first two games, allowing Adol to control his sword in a variety of directions. Beside changing the battle system, the game's perspective switches to a side-scrolling view, as opposed to the top-down one of the previous games. Adol also has the ability to jump now.  New to the series is the use of magical rings, which give Adol different powering-up abilities such as healing and shielding. The game also uses various key items found along the way to solve minor puzzles and progress the story.</resource>

He grew up on drugs made to destroy his own will and turn him into the Beast Messenger, a powerful creature serving Maletoth, The Beast Lord himself. He did his job, until one day he noticed a man about to be sacrificed in a ritual, his face triggering ancient memories. As the sacrificial knife descended into the man's body, Aarbron recognizes his father's face. As his father dies in the altar, memories of his childhood and tormented past at the hands of the Beast Lord emerged, and as feelings of hate over his captors took over him, he swore revenge and fled the temple, knowing the road to avenge his father and redemption would be hard.

Shadow of the Beast is a side-scrolling platformer. The player has to navigate through several areas filled with enemies and traps, collecting keys and activating triggers than open new areas or give Aarbron the means to overcome a sub-boss. The number of moves the player has at disposal is limited: duck, jump and only two attacks: punch and a flying kick. While most enemies die with just one hit, the player must time each attack accurately. However, there are also traps of objects that cannot be destroyed, and these require the player to jump, duck or move according the sequence. The player has only one life with 12 hit points that can be replenished by collecting some objects hidden in the level (like an off-route location or a under a megalith), which also contributes to the difficulty level.</resource>

It became increasingly hard to maintain them, and special robots known as &amp;quot;Bidroids&amp;quot; were invented to do the hard work. However, the colonies began waging war on each other, and Bidroids were used for military purposes. When peace was finally achieved, the leaders decided that Bidroids could continue functioning as combat machines, but in friendly championships rather than in deadly wars. 

Hyper Wars is primarily a managerial simulation; robot combat itself is calculated depending on how the player created and maintained his or her robots. The player controls a manager of a team which competes in a league, complete with schedules, stadiums, etc. The player is given an initial budget with which he or she is able to create the first robot models and train them. Each robot can be created by merging together various parts (&amp;quot;human&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;beast&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;bird&amp;quot;, and so on). After creation, it is necessary to outfit the robot with weapons and upgrade its parameters by paying for training. When the player feels ready, the robots can be taken to combat arenas and participate in the tournament.</resource>

The gameplay differs from most fighting games. In this game, you have a Spirit meter. A Spirit meter is in the game and will decrease as you perform special moves. It can be recharged, but doing so leaves you open to attack. When your health is almost gone, you can perform a secret combination that will unleash a deadly attack on your opponent - provided you have a full Spirit meter.

The arcade version doesn't allow you to play as Mr. Big and the elusive Mr. Karate.</resource>

    <resource id="dc79be413e7c704ea46e8beb45b8e8fadedeca05" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">The Space Adventure, known in Japan as Cobra II: Densetsu no Otoko, is the second game dedicated to the adventures of the renegade space pirate Cobra. The game is based on original manga and TV series by Buichi Terasawa.

While waiting in a bar for his partner, Cobra encounters a beautiful bounty hunter named Jane. Very soon he realizes that the bounty Jane has been hunting for his own head, for which the Galaxy Patrol has put quite a reward. But everything changes when Crystal Boy, the head of the Pirate Guild and Cobra's archenemy, appears on the scene. Jane's father had apparently hidden a great treasure, encoding its location in tattoos on the backs of his triplet daughters. Crystal Boy wants this treasure, and is going after Jane and her sisters. Cobra and Jane decide to join forces in order to find Jane's sisters and to undermine Crystal Boy's plans.

The game is a Japanese-style adventure. The player advances in the game by choosing various commands (&amp;quot;Look&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Talk&amp;quot;, etc.). There are a few places in the game where Cobra dies if the player makes a wrong decision. In the final location the player will also have to fight enemies in turn-based style. The game features a large number of animated cutscenes as well as voice-overs for many dialogues.</resource>

    <resource id="961bdf8a62bcda4e8e32bf49d00344524a4c4143" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Based on the popular manga/anime series of the same name, Ranma 1/2 follows the story of an aspiring martial artist who accidentally turns into a young woman by bathing in a cursed spring. He can revert to his natural form by touching hot water; however, contact with cold water will turn him into a girl again. Most of the original manga story is dedicated to semi-comical situations, based on the fact that Ranma is trying to conceal his predicament, which leads to misunderstandings, confusion, and romantic complications in his high school life.

This interpretation of the license follows a part of the initial manga story, starting with the curse and going through Ranma's first conflicts with schoolmates and rival martial artists. The game is mostly structured like a &amp;quot;beat-'em-up&amp;quot; side-scroller, though there are also several boss fights that are more reminiscent of a one-on-one fighting game. The Vs. mode allows the player to recreate these boss fights using different characters. 

Ranma's curse becomes a gameplay feature in the game: cold and hot water turn Ranma into a girl and a boy, respectively. Female Ranma is quicker and can jump higher, but her attack and defense are lower. Anime-style cut scenes advance the story between the levels.</resource>

    <resource id="8db59d964f0f0b5099dc3edc45e75a3f7e16b0a4" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Based on the  Ranma 1/2 manga and anime series, Toraware no Hanayome consists of several chapters, which are similar to episodes of a TV show: each one has its own story and theme, but all the chapters have recurrent characters from the Ranma 1/2 universe. As in the original manga and anime, the story focuses on the young martial artist and high school student Ranma, who was cursed after bathing in a sacred Chinese spring: contact with cold water turns him into a woman, while hot water restores him to his original masculine form. Most of the story in the game is dedicated to Ranma's relationships with his schoolmates and other characters, often involving comic and/or romantic situations, as well as Ranma's attempts to get rid of the curse: in the first chapter, he tries to win a contest that would allow him to travel to China and find a way to turn him into a man permanently.

Unlike most other Ranma 1/2 iterations, this game is a so-called &amp;quot;digital comic&amp;quot;, which is the same as Japanese-style adventure. Controlling Ranma, the player interacts with the environment by selecting verb commands (&amp;quot;Look&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Talk&amp;quot;, etc.) and objects from sub-menus. The navigation is also menu-based. Animated cut scenes appear frequently to advance the story.</resource>

Together with your fellow travellers, Jonjon and Nekketsu, you work your way through a humorous sci-fi story. The gameplay is very standard RPG stuff with towns containing shops, hotels and so on, and the world map throwing up random encounters every few steps. These battles are turn based with the usual mechanics of selecting your attacks and watching them play out - although you have to choose carefully, as you don't default to the next available target when one is destroyed, which will often have you shooting into thin air.</resource>

The second World Heroes game features new stages and music, as well as improved animation and graphics. Fighters can now reflect projectile moves at their opponents, and reverse normal throws if the player's timing is right. The original game's Death Match mode is also back, but with a new feature - the life bar will increase or decrease as the fighter inflicts or receives damage. If the player manages to get his fighter's life bar to 100%, the enemy will lose.</resource>

Once again, the players assume the role of brothers Billy and Jimmy Lee, who are now tasked with the duty of avenging Marian's death. The arcade version of the game is essentially an improved version of the original title. The biggest change in the game's controls are in the replacement of the original's punch and kick buttons with two directional-based attack buttons (Left Attack and Right Attack) similar to Renegade. Pressing the attack button of the player's current direction will do a standard series of punches, while pressing the opposite attack button will perform a back kick. A few new moves are added as well, including a Hurricane Kick.</resource>

It bears most similarities in style to the Chariot game on Three Wonders.

The player controls Cotton, a young witch on a broomstick. The player must blast various monsters and avoid being shot. The player can collect power-ups to enhance their weaponry and unleash a more powerful attack on the enemy. The player has lives represented by an arrow. The player has three lives and is only allowed one hit per life.</resource>

You fly left-to-right mostly, with occasional vertically-scrolling sections, and use several different weapon styles to defeat your many foes. Along with Esty in her ship the &amp;quot;Wild Cat&amp;quot;, you must defeat the forces of General Don Jingi, who has plans of taking energy from the star of Aries.

Playing as the pilot Hawk, players must avoid collisions and weapon-fire from the General's &amp;quot;Obellon&amp;quot; army. Consisting of many different types of enemy, the army has a massive, sprawling force of guns, turret, ships, battle-stations and mech-type units. Their fire-power is immense and you are the single opposing force!

Gate of Thunder allows players to choose in real-time from three weapon-fire types. A blue-coloured electrical fire, a green-coloured wave-fire, and a red-coloured quake-type fire. Along with this, players obtain homing-missiles and the assistance of the &amp;quot;Wild Cat&amp;quot; which orbits the ship separately. Gate of Thunder also features a critically acclaimed soundtrack that remains a talking-point to this day.</resource>

The game has a rather abstract plot that depicts a battle between two human organizations, each piloting and commanding giant mechs; no further details are revealed in the game. The gameplay takes place on a battlefield composed out of dots connected by lines; both player-controlled and opponent's army can move only between adjacent dots. 

The player has six commanders at his disposal; each of them can lead a several various mechas into the battle. Three commanders are available initially, while others can be called into battle later. Once a player-controlled and an enemy unit meet on the same dot, the player can order the commander to attack, defend, or retreat. The battle then proceeds automatically, its result calculated by the statistics of both units. The role-playing element involves leveling up mecha parts; a number of experience points is awarded after a battle, and the player can freely distribute them to raise the mecha's parameters.</resource>

There are three modes available: training, match play, and tournament. Match play is essentially a story mode that casts the player in the role of a young man whose mother has passed away and who tries to find solace in golf. In this mode, opponents must be defeated in a linear fashion and courses are dictated by the story. In training and tournament modes the player can choose between six different courses. The tournament mode is a competition between various characters who appeared as opponents in the match play mode. The golf game itself is viewed from a top-down perspective at all times, and allows the player to choose the type of club as well as adjust the angle and the strength of the shot.</resource>

    <resource id="beb18beaba2c1c00b272159aab63c38bf022c740" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">The governing planet of the Vasteel Solar System is called Belose. Emperors of the Faracia dynasty have been ruling the planet for hundreds of years. However, the last emperor turned out to be rather unpopular with the people, and they began talking about changing the government system. Unexpectedly, the emperor becomes gravely ill and dies soon thereafter. His elder son, Faliall, is proclaimed the heir. However, Faliall's younger brother, Stefan, cares for the wishes of the simple folk, and is willing to change things. Hence, the bloody war between the two brothers for power and justice begins...

Vasteel is a hex-based war strategy game in its core. The story mode takes the player (who controls either Stefan's or Faliall's armies) through various top-down maps, on which the two armies will try to annihilate each other, advance to a better position, conquer enemy cities, etc. There is also a versus mode, which allows two-player gameplay, as well as access to all the maps regardless of the story.

The armies of the two princes are entirely robotic; even tanks, cannons, and spaceships are shaped like &amp;quot;transformer&amp;quot; robots. Both armies have factories, which can produce new robots, even several times per turn; each such productions costs money, of which there is limited amount. The player navigates the robots in turn-based fashion over the map. Combat ensues when two robots are on the same grid.

Unlike in most games of this kind, the actual battles in Vasteel are interactive and action-based. The players must quickly move their robots and shoot at each other. Same applies to robots which enter factories and cities with the intention to destroy their protective mechanisms; the defending side uses stationary turrets to fire at the robot, while the latter tries to avoid them and get to the core before being destroyed.</resource>

The girl doesn't remember anything, and grows up together with the dragons. But when she turns fifteen, she decides to go back to her homeland - the Human World. Soon after Tamryn has left, Atrushan realizes he can't bear the separation, and asks the White Dragon to allow him to go and find Tamryn in the Human World. But a mysterious evil curse has been placed on the dragons - they can't appear among the humans in their true form. Atrushan agrees to become a human and goes to the Human World - to find Tamryn, and also a way to remove the curse...</resource>

It's a shoot ?em up, with the player taking the role of an almost nude muscle-man (Adon) or his brother (Samson) in a 2 player game. Their main weapon is a ball of energy that grows over a hole in their heads and shoots out towards any advancing enemies. Other, more powerful shots are achieved by a combination of back-forward-fire, down-up-fire etc on the pad. Through the levels you will encounter all manner of nasties out to get you, but you are aided by a woman in blue that flies around and drops power-ups conveniently for you. Also, levels vary from the standard left-to-right to vertically scrolling.</resource>

We don't know yet what happened to humanity, but we know it was eradicated. The new Earth is called Makai - the Demon World. Generations of mythological creatures dwell upon the planet, from which the human being has mysteriously disappeared. One day, a wave of energy hits the Earth. The leaders of the demons realize that a robotic alien race from outer space threatens their existence. The explosion turns earth into a wasteland. Many demons die in the chaos of destruction. It is now up to the remaining demons to fend off the alien invaders, to bring back peace to the demonic race, and perhaps to find out more about the tragic fate of humanity.nnLast Armageddon can be described as a post-apocalyptic Final Fantasy. Instead of a party of four light warriors who fight hordes of demons, you have a party of four demons who fight... no, not hordes of light warriors, but mysterious robot-like aliens.</resource>

Yuuko has been taken away by a mysterious gang. Ai is determined to save her from the clutches of crime. In a seemingly all-female city overrun by insane workers, biker gangs, and assorted criminals, Ai and her friends Chika and Makoto decide to work together in order to restore the world to normality again.

Ane-san is what is commonly called beat-'em-up, i.e. a fighting game that allows limited movement through side-scrolling environment. The player can choose to control a variety of female fighters. In the beginning, only Ai, Chika, and Makoto are selectable. Ai is the all-around balanced character, Chika is fast and fragile, while Makoto is very strong, but slow. Later in the game, other playable characters become available. Each fighter has a health points bar, which can be restored by healing items scattered through the levels. Once a character is dead, the player can continue playing with another one.

The player typically advances through side-scrolling stages, clearing each screen of enemies before being able to continue walking to the right. Each girl has the standard kicks, punches, and jumps at her disposal, as well as special moves, one per each girl. Stages culminate by boss battles (usually two per stage). 

Between the stages, the player can go shopping. A large variety of items is available, some enhancing the performance of the girls, but most purely for visual effect - the room the player views between the stages changes its appearance depending on the items the player has bought.

Also available between the stages (and as a separate gameplay mode, &amp;quot;vs.&amp;quot;) is a mini-game, in which the player(s) have to rapidly press buttons in order to make the controllable girl execute a hideous grimace, that will surpass that of the opponent in ugliness and speed of execution.</resource>

Afterwards, they began producing giant combat robots, evidently prepared to build an entire army and become the most dominant military power on the Earth. It's time to stop them! The young hero, piloting a giant combat robot of his own, is sent to Sea Square precisely for that reason...

Browning is a side-scrolling shooter. The player controls the giant robot, equipped with a single gun (with unlimited ammunition), and must fight waves of enemies (mostly of a robotic kind), and eventually the stage boss. Short cut scenes appear between the stages. The player-controlled robot has the ability to hover in the air (the player has to repeatedly press a button to make the robot keep the height). The hit points of the robot depend on the condition of its shield. When the robot stands still, shield energy recharges slowly. Complete loss of shield energy makes the robot so vulnerable that the next hit destroys it. The player is given unlimited continues, but must return to the beginning of the stage each time the robot is destroyed.</resource>

The game includes a main campaign with introduction and background information about the fictional countries involved in the conflict. In addition, at least a dozen playable maps are included, some representing real geographical areas. The MSX and PC Engine (TurboGrafx) CD versions feature enhanced graphics, full-screen battle sequences with backgrounds, and many additional maps.

This time, a young Japanese street racer has been defeated by an American who claims that Japan's level is not up to par. His feelings hurt, the youth ventures to the United States, trying to earn enough money and participate in races to defend his national pride.

The game is very similar to its predecessor in concept, but offers additional options in the story mode. Part-time jobs now include delivery assignments that play like overhead racing games, as well as tending to dogs of various breeds for money. The security guard assignment plays like a mini-RPG, complete with turn-based combat, experience points, and levels. In addition, it is possible to visit racing tracks and bet money on participants. The versus mode allows players to choose between three courses to compete in, racing against each other (in a top-down mode) or computer AI (first-person).</resource>

In the year 1984, however, it was stolen under mysterious circumstances. Seventeen years later, Sayaka, the young heiress of the Asano family, forms a group together with her friends Miki and Kyoko, and the three begin looking for the lost treasure. Heist after heist goes by unsuccessfully. Eventually, the girls organize a TV show, challenging dubious personalities to card games, hoping to find the Sorcerer's Trump in process.

Cardangels is a card game in which the player takes the roles of the three friends, playing cards against young, attractive female opponents. Four types of card games are available: poker, blackjack, speed, and babanuki (a variant of old maid). A slot machine-like introduction determines which games are played against which opponents. The player can select the amount of rounds (minimum ten) needed to win a game and advance to the next opponent. The &amp;quot;free play&amp;quot; mode allows the player to choose the type of game actively, but the amount of available opponents is lower. There is no gambling in any of the games; points are awarded for combinations in poker and blackjack. The opponents undress after losing a game; however, they retain their underwear - there is no explicit nudity in the game.</resource>

As the game starts a struggle for total control over elemental powers is about to begin between two warring nations. As the best mecha pilot in the good guy's army it's your task to repel the invasion and win the war by dealing with the enemy armada in standard shooter fashion. But surprise surprise! You won't be alone this time, as other AI-controlled mecha pilots will join you in the fray at key moments. Only you can command the magical powers that can be added to your mecha by collecting several color-coded orbs though, so most of the fight is still going to be up to you.</resource>

The game is divided into four seasons, each with a sub-plot of its own (e.g. preparing to a competition with another school and handling intrusive journalists and possible spies), and each dealing with a team of five different girls. The player can check the dossier of all the twenty students at any time and learn more about them. The game features digitized photos of real people instead of the more common anime-style character graphics.

Gameplay-wise, the game features a traditional menu containing verb commands for examining the environment, talking to characters, checking the inventory, moving to another location, etc.; most of these verbs lead to a list of possible objects to interact with. There are no puzzles, but a few instances require the player to make the right choices in order to continue the game; in other cases it is possible to slightly branch the plot by making a decision.</resource>

Eien no Princess continues the story of the first game. Yuna has defeated the 13 Servants of Darkness, and their leader Lia has become a friend, fighting crime on her own in a superhero TV show. Life seems to continue normally, the only trouble being Erika, a snotty high school girl who sees herself as Yuna's biggest rival. She challenges Yuna to a fight, but both are spotted by the titular starship &amp;quot;Eternal Princess&amp;quot;, commanded by the pretty Princess Mirage, whose task is to stop violence in the whole galaxy. What begins as a misunderstanding ends as a serious threat to the Earth...

Eien no Princess is what is usually called a &amp;quot;visual novel&amp;quot;. Most of the game consists of the player being taken to different locations automatically, where he watches the story unfold, accompanied by text and voice acting. Sometimes there is a menu verb to click on (such as &amp;quot;Look at...&amp;quot;), which doesn't mean much since the menu offers no choices. There are, however, a few turn-based battles in the game, with different attacks to choose, such as attack, defense, special, etc.</resource>

The story stars two female mercenaries, Efera and Jiliora. After having escaped from a slave ship, through a series of events they come into possession of a powerful crest. This crest was taken away from the benevolent prince and princess, who were abducted by an evil cults that worships an ancient powerful deity. The two young women must find a way to save the royal offsprings, and defeat the evil worshippers.

The game is an RPG with action-based combat. The player can choose to play as either Efera or Jiliora; there is also a two-player mode in which it is possible to control both. Efera is the weaker fighter, but she can use healing and offensive magic spells, which she learns as she levels up. Jiliora is stronger, but unable to cast magic; as she advances in levels, she obtains rings that can enhance her sword power, heal an amount of her HP, and even make her invincible for a while.

As in most RPGs, player-controlled characters traverse hostile areas and fight enemies for experience and money, which can later be spent in towns to acquire better equipment and items.

Two young pilots were in the midst of a battle, and one of them, a lovely young woman, was killed. Three years later, the surviving pilot finally got a chance to avenge her death. Navigating a powerful new fighter ship named &amp;quot;Slasher&amp;quot;, the pilot ventured into space, ready to bring destruction to those who took so much away from him.

Nexzr is a vertically scrolling shoot-em-up similar to Super Star Soldier. The player-controlled spaceship starts with a simple vulcan gun that can only shoot straight. Various power-ups can either enhance the strength of this gun, replace it with a laser weapon, or add a secondary weapon (homing fire, thin spreading laser attacks, etc.), which is activated automatically. Mid- and end-level bosses are encountered on nearly every stage. Additional lives can be collected, but the player always restarts from the beginning of the stage when his fighter craft is destroyed.</resource>

The most dangerous pirate crew is the one of Sol Bianca - April, Janny, May, June, and Feb. No, those are not names of months, but five beautiful ladies, who can handle some high-tech weaponry and who think only about treasure. But the five lovely pirates are not evil - whenever some tyrant threatens a planet, they are there to help.

The gameplay of  Sol Bianca is that of a traditional Japanese-style RPG. The player controls the five girls as a party, each one having individual statistics.

    <resource id="c2d8575cfebfa660df9387fcdb028af01611232b" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">The protagonist of the game was watching a performance by the Japanese singer Noriko Sakai (NORI-P) on TV. Suddenly, the singer was caught in a whirlwind and disappeared. The hero bravely followed her into a magical alternate dimension, but ended up in a forest, unable to find her. He must now find NORI-P and defeat an evil magician in the process.

Kagami no Kuni no Legend is a Japanese-style first-person adventure game. The player interacts with the game world by selecting verb commands from a menu and combining them with objects or characters. Commands such as &amp;quot;Examine&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Talk&amp;quot; appear at most screens; if an object can be taken, an appropriate command is displayed after the player has thoroughly examined a location. There is also an inventory with items that must be used at specific moments; however, there are no real puzzles in the game. Navigation is done by selecting the &amp;quot;Move&amp;quot; command; in a few locations the player navigates the hero with directional buttons in a pseudo-3D environment. Wrong choices may sometimes lead to a Game Over.

Most of the background and character graphics is done in anime style, with the exception of Noriko herself, who appears in digital photos, sometimes accompanied by song performances.</resource>

The story and general gameplay of Burai: Hachigyoku no Y?shi Densetsu is similar to those of the original Burai: J?kan for computers; however, the console versions were developed from scratch and therefore differ greatly from the computer ones, having new cutscenes, dialogues, battle interface, etc. Perhaps the most important difference gameplay-wise is the linear nature of chapters. In the computer versions, the player can choose to start as any of the eight selectable heroes; in the console versions, the player has to start with Gonza and Maimai.</resource>

The main mode involves a quiz competition in which players can choose the topics of the questions, e.g. movies, video games, history, etc. Up to five players can participate in this mode or compete against the computer AI. 

The &amp;quot;adventure mode&amp;quot; is a board game in which the player-controlled character's movement is determined by a dice roll. Normal fields lead to short quiz encounters; other fields may enhance the protagonist's hit points, and the final field on each stage is a more challenging &amp;quot;boss battle&amp;quot;. 

Time attack mode involves answering correctly as many questions as possible within the allotted time limit. Finally, versus mode has players competing against each other; every right answer advances the character on a board, while the opponent is pushed back. All modes feature characters from other games published by Hudson Soft, such as Bomberman or Tengai Maky? series.</resource>

    <resource id="b676082d13c12fb527b344ea104ab529eb7d5752" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">The game is based on the novel cycle Record of Lodoss War by Ryo Mizuno, and more closely on subsequent manga volumes and OVA series. Its story generally follows the one of the OVA, the main hero being Parn, a young man who grows up in a small village and later becomes one of the strongest warriors in the world, thanks to his father's mysterious heritage and his own courage. Like in the anime series, the game begins with a goblin attack and with Parn leaving his home village together with his best friend Etoh in search of adventure.

This version of Record of Lodoss War is a traditional Japanese RPG with top-down world map navigation and random battles. There is a strategic element in the battles, allowing the characters to freely move on the battle field. However, the battles can be set on auto, making them more fast-paced and similar to traditional Japanese RPG combat. The towns have menu-based first-person view navigation.</resource>

    <resource id="fcc139d894271c2b7c7ffdc18a7a2f3cfa1b6f45" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Many years ago, the legendary warriors of the Fire Clan were expelled from the Garden of Eden, and built the wonderful land Jipang. Thousand years later, Jipang is entering its medieval era. It seems that the province Hida is suffering from a curse placed upon it by the evil clan of the Dark Orchids. To destroy the Orchids, a young boy named Manjimaru has to fight the demons who protect them, find companions who would help him on the quest, and prove he is worthy of his great legacy as the descendant of the Fire Clan.

Tengai Maky? II: Manjimaru is a sequel to Tengai Maky?: Ziria. Though not connected to its predecessor directly story-wise, the game is set in the same semi-humorous rendition of feudal Japan, and shares many recurrent gameplay-related and stylistic elements. The player navigates a party of up to four characters on a vast overworld divided into provinces, each with its own capital city and several smaller towns. Randomly encountered enemies are fought in turn-based, first-person view combat. Like in the previous game, magic spells must be obtained by locating Tengu Retreats; they can be then equipped on any character and swapped between them.

Enemy hit points are displayed during battles, and characters are restored to full health when leveling up. Full-screen anime-style cutscenes with voiceovers advance the story. As opposed to the previous game, Manjimaru has several audio music tracks in addition to synthesized ones. </resource>

The game features real wrestlers from the time period it was released in. The wrestlers appear as digitized photos in the intro sequence and on the character selection screens; during gameplay, they are rendered as 2D graphical images.

The game has four gameplay modes; the &amp;quot;battle mode&amp;quot; allows the player to choose one wrestler and compete against opponents chosen and controlled by the computer AI. The other modes correspond to a league, a cup (knock-out stages only), and a &amp;quot;versus&amp;quot; mode, in which the player can also choose any opponent to compete against. In every mode, the player is able to choose between single match (one-on-one) and tag team, with an additional wrestler on each side. The league mode allows competition between up to four players.

The combat system is similar to that of fighting games, with a side view and health bars for the wrestlers.</resource>

Like the book, the game portrays the struggle between the Northern Court, ruled by the decadent H?j? clan (later betrayed by their vassal Ashikaga Takauji), and the Southern Court of the emperor Go-Daigo. The gameplay has strong grand strategy elements and is similar to Koei's &amp;quot;historical simulation&amp;quot; series. The player can choose to control either the Northern or the Southern forces, choosing the actions for the leader and all his vassals. The player can choose to engage in diplomacy with rulers of other provinces, sign agreements, and manage and navigate armies. Combat takes place on a separate top-down grid, on which he player navigates the soldiers in turn-based fashion. Individual battles proceed automatically, their outcome based on the participant's attributes.</resource>

However, its story is not directly connected with that of the predecessor. The main hero is a young boy named Voice Knuckles, who enjoys a peaceful life with his mother and his girlfriend Diggy. But the cruel Emperor Agares attacks his planet and destroys Voice's home, killing his mother in the process. The boy swears revenge. Aided by his girlfriend and his friends, he assembles a rebel army from fighters who navigate giant robots, and is determined to defeat Agares at all costs.

The game is more story-heavy than its predecessor, and has more clearly pronounced anime/manga aesthetics. Animated cut scenes occur between the missions and advance the story. Even during the large strategic battles, characters would often engage in dialogue, and scripted events might occur.</resource>

The game plays like a standard action side-scroller in which you must clear each stage of all enemies using your attacks and make your way to the end-level boss, kick his metallic behind and advance to the next stage. You have at your disposal an energy blade and a small collection of ranged attacks to deal with your enemies, and between certain stages you get to play shooter sequences to spice things up.</resource>

    <resource id="58282ff02da84cac37f8d10094957eac55057710" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">In this game, the player controls a swordsman named Alan. One day he arrives at the village of Flodi, and finds out that his help is needed: the daughter of the village elder, Sophia, has been kidnapped by monsters and taken into the nearby cave. Naturally, rescuing Sophia is just the first quest among the many perils that await the hero on his journey...

La Valeur is a RPG that mostly follows the Japanese format: the hero wanders through the top-down locations, fighting randomly appearing enemies in turn-based combat, gaining money and experience, leveling up automatically, and advancing the story in a linear fashion. 

However, there are also some less traditional features in the game. There are three classes of weapons, distinguished by the type of damage they inflict: slashing, piercing, and bludgeoning. Different types of enemies are strong/weak against different classes of weapons. Magic is learned by obtaining keys from wizards in various towns, searching the surrounding areas for treasure chests, retrieving magic rings of different kinds from them, and then bringing them back to the wizard to learn new spells.

The entire quest is played solo, without party members. There is no &amp;quot;world map&amp;quot;, which is characteristic for other games of this kind. The gameplay is heavy on &amp;quot;level-grinding&amp;quot;; typically, a certain level must be reach in a given area before the hero is able to defeat the boss enemy. After having reached this level, regular enemies of that area stop giving experience points.</resource>

Humans have constructed a super-computer known as MESIA, entrusting it with the task of monitoring everything that happens on the planet. However, the computer grew increasingly megalomaniac, and eventually decided to conquer the Earth with deadly machines of its own production. In the middle of the 23rd century, humanity engages in a decisive battle against MESIA. Their hopes lie with Ken Ryugasaki, who pilots the powerful mecha Tracer on his journey to the super-computer's lair.

Genocide is a side-scrolling action game. The player controls Tracer, who can fight with a sword-like melee weapon and jump. Later in the game Tracer acquires &amp;quot;Betty&amp;quot;, a powerful weapon that can shoot in eight directions. The gameplay is fairly straightforward; there are no power-ups, and the bulk of the game consists of surviving continuous onslaughts of enemies.</resource>

This figure asks them to collect certain items that he has placed inside various buildings to test his security force. If they return the items successfully, Mobo and Robo will be rewarded. The two of them state that they will get the job done in just three minutes. However, little do they know that each building is packed with security guards who will raise the alarm if they are caught red-handed. Fortunately both Mobo and Robo are equipped with bullets that can knock the guards unconscious for a few seconds. An $100 reward will be given out if Mobo and Robo are apprehended.

As either Mobo or Robo, you must collect all the treasures before leaving the ten buildings and shoot any security guards that get in your way. Remember that you are under a time limit. An in-game map will help you locate the treasures. There is a bonus stage after three buildings, where the object is to collect the gold bars in a limited amount of time without  one of the three spotlights shining on you. If it is possible, hide behind open doors. If you manage to get all the gold bars, 10,000 points is added to your score. There are three of these bonus stages, but each of them varies.</resource>

The story focuses on a young man named Spark, who wants to become a knight of the country of Flaim. King Kashue needs Spark to prove himself worthy of this title, and tells him to gather a band of mercenaries and prepare to stop the dark wizard Wagnard's mysterious plans.

The gameplay is similar to the previous Record of Lodoss War game. Spark and his party roam the top-down world map, visiting towns, villages, and other locations on the way. Enemies appear randomly. The turn-based battles once again offer free movement on the screen, but as before, auto-battle feature can speed things up. Towns and other important locations are viewed as still screens from first-person perspective.</resource>

It is an action game similar in concept to Bomberman. The game consists of three &amp;quot;worlds&amp;quot;, each with ten screens; on every screen, four ducks are competing against each other in collecting eggs and delivering their babies home. The ducks can be controlled by human players or by computer AI. Eggs are being dropped into the maze-like stage; the goal is to collect as many of them as possible. Once collected, an egg follows the duck, and after a while a baby would hatch and return home safely.

Each duck tries to sabotage the work of other ducks by placing fried eggs on their paths. In addition, various hazards and enemies keep appearing, trying to impede the ducks' progress. Ducks can be knocked down, paralyzed, and robbed of their eggs.</resource>

Flying over the various landscapes (you get to choose which order to play the first four levels in), you come up against tidal waves, giant robots and a general array of nasty but cute bad guys as you would expect. The plants from the original PC Kid games are still here to provide such joys as extra firepower, fountains of smiley faces or the tiny-denjin which makes dodging bullets that little bit easier. Another handy little trick is that your boots also pack a punch, so backing into an enemy is more likely to dispose of them than do you any permanent damage. Part way along each of the levels you get the chance to rescue a friend who then joins with you, giving you a specific extra ability. These friends are pre-set one per level and cannot be chosen, and they allow things like rapid-sushi-fire and handy rear shots.</resource>

Unlike the  earlier Ranma 1/2 iteration by the  same company, this game does not follow the main manga/anime story, and does not include any other gameplay elements beside one-on-one fighting. However, the game is still rich on story-telling; fully voiced anime-style cut scenes appear after each battle and serve to put Ranma in various situations and set the stage for battles against familiar character from the manga and anime, such the old pervert Happousai, Mousse, Ryuga, etc.  

The Vs. mode allows two-player gameplay; the players can choose any combinations of the characters who appear in the game to test their skills. As Ranma, the player can revert to his female form (this time at will, simply by pressing a button); the female Ranma is more agile but less powerful. The combat system includes characteristic fighting game mechanics, with punches, kicks, jumps, combinations of buttons to execute specific moves, and powerful special attacks, which can be executed after charging the power.</resource>

One day, Foltjunia is attacked and ends up unconscious on the pavement in one of the cities in Japan, planet Earth. There, she is found by a regular high-school student named Takaya. It appears that Foltjunia has lost her transformation abilities. Her sisters decide to stay with Takaya for a while, masquerading as high-school girls, which greatly complicates the young man's social and romantic life.

Having the same characters and initial plot as Hatsukoi Monogatari, Denn? Tenshi: Digital Ange is a Japanese-style adventure game with very limited interaction and strictly linear progression. Most screens allow the player to choose verb commands such as &amp;quot;Look&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Talk&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Watch&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Go&amp;quot;, etc. from a menu, usually combining them with character and object names in a sub-menu.

The player is responsible for paying salary to managers, mechanics, and other members of the staff; it is possible to raise or lower the salary, which may lead to various consequences depending on the employee's personality. Then the player makes contract with one or more drivers, selecting them from a list. Car customization plays an important role. Gasoline, engines, chassis, wheels, tires, brakes, and other components must be purchased from manufacturers of the player's choice. 

The racing competition itself is non-interactive. Tournament events follow depending on its schedule, and the player simply watches how the race unfolds and ends according to the participants' parameters. Brand and player names in the game resemble real ones, but have been slightly altered for copyright reasons.</resource>

The year is 2047. Mankind is facing its gravest crisis. A mysterious bio-roid life form has appeared. Its true nature and purpose are unknown. Is it some country's secret weapon, or an alien from another world? They appear in the winter, killing people and taking their place in society. They wear artificial skin and can sweat and even bleed. 

A new police force, specifically trained to fight the Snatchers, has been formed. They are JUNKERs. Every time you encounter someone, a difficult question must be asked ? is it a person or a snatcher?

The player takes control of Gillian Seed, one of the JUNKERs. The gameplay largely follows the structure of a Japanese-style adventure. The player uses a menu-driven interface to execute commands, which include moving between locations and interacting with the environment.</resource>

You fly left-to-right mostly, with occasional vertically-scrolling sections, and use several different weapon styles to defeat your many foes. Along with Esty in her ship the &amp;quot;Wild Cat&amp;quot;, you must defeat the forces of General Don Jingi, who has plans of taking energy from the star of Aries.

Playing as the pilot Hawk, players must avoid collisions and weapon-fire from the General's &amp;quot;Obellon&amp;quot; army. Consisting of many different types of enemy, the army has a massive, sprawling force of guns, turret, ships, battle-stations and mech-type units. Their fire-power is immense and you are the single opposing force!

Gate of Thunder allows players to choose in real-time from three weapon-fire types. A blue-coloured electrical fire, a green-coloured wave-fire, and a red-coloured quake-type fire. Along with this, players obtain homing-missiles and the assistance of the &amp;quot;Wild Cat&amp;quot; which orbits the ship separately. Gate of Thunder also features a critically acclaimed soundtrack that remains a talking-point to this day.</resource>

    <resource id="ac90886cef85f2bba25a7f91a5e4d615f6988ac1" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Hiwako, the daughter of a convenience store owner in a little Japanese town, is just an ordinary Japanese teenager - actually a bit of a spoiled brat. Or so she thought, until one day, a talking bird named Nike (like the Greek goddess of victory, not like the footwear brand) told her that she possessed unique powers that made her transform into the glorious lady warrior Artemis. No, Hiwako didn't stop being a spoiled brat; but as Artemis, it is now her duty to protect her home town from a demonic invasion, and she does not intend to give up.

Moonlight Lady can be called a &amp;quot;pseudo-RPG&amp;quot;; its top-down view and town exploration make it look like a representative of the Japanese branch of this genre, but in reality, it is an action game with light adventure elements and no true role-playing system. 

Throughout most of the game, the player controls Artemis and two other heroines (Aquarius and Minerva). Attacking is performed by pressing a button for the lead character's attack, and another for a simultaneous attack by the two other girls. The player can switch the leader at any time. The girls can also charge their attacks to execute more powerful ones.

Regular enemies populate the dungeons, but there is no reward (in the role-playing sense of this word) in defeating them; in fact, the player can try to avoid them altogether and head straight to the boss battle.

A few items can be found and used throughout the game, but there is no real weapon and armor management, nor a financial system of any kind.</resource>

The game's structure mimics collection of Bikkuriman stickers. The original stickers had different values; the bizarre Bikkuriman characters were divided into three classes (Angels, Protectors, and Demons), and the highest-rated (and rarest) stickers were the so-called &amp;quot;Heads&amp;quot;, mostly bearing names from various mythologies and religions (&amp;quot;Super Zeus&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Maria&amp;quot;, etc.). In the game, the player can view a number of the more &amp;quot;ordinary&amp;quot; stickers; the &amp;quot;head&amp;quot; is available only after having answered a trivia question correctly. 

Each &amp;quot;head&amp;quot; unlocks a map part of the Bikkuriman world; each part, in its turn, unlocks a series of short non-interactive scenes from the anime, accompanied by narration.</resource>

But one day, a messenger brings terrible news: the castle of Farland was attacked, the king, the princess, and countless soldiers brutally slain. Zomu Dizae, the third and the final demon commander of the dark world Zekisis (Latok has defeated the other two, Badu and Gospel), has arrived. He is aided by the treacherous Necromancer, who turned the soldiers of Farland into monsters. Will Latok be able to defeat the evil once again?

Xak III: The Eternal Recurrence is an action RPG, similar in gameplay style to its  predecessors, but also incorporating some elements first introduced in  Tower of Gazel, such as the ability to jump and having companions (although this feature is much more limited here). Jumping ability is crucial in many cases, as there are obstacles that can only be avoided by jumping over them. Latok starts at level 50, but still can gain experience points and become stronger. A new (and very useful) feature is hit points restoration, which occurs when Latok is standing still. To counter that, enemies can re-spawn, which means that there aren't many completely safe areas in the game.</resource>

It is set in the fantasy land known as Pentawa, whose inhabitants are in constant need of protection from ferocious creatures roaming the wilderness. The king of Pentawa hires a party of adventurers, and their first assignment is to retrieve a precious sceptre from a dungeon, where it is guarded by the evil demonic lord Ouks.

The game is an RPG with an unusual side-scrolling perspective and action-based combat, somewhat of a cross between Wizardry and platform games. Despite being a Japanese game, Sorcerian resembles Western RPGs of its time, focusing more on character development than story. In the beginning, the player creates a party of four characters, choosing between fighter, wizard, elf, and dwarf .</resource>

Both games were ported to the PC Engine (TurboGrafx) CD console with various enhancements, unreleased separately. In fact, the two games are merged into one, as the player is able to play through both of them continuously directly from the main menu.

Though the game(s) are rather faithful in gameplay and graphical design to the original computer versions, the enhancements are significant enough to consider this release a remake. Similarly to the NES / Famicom version, the dungeons have simple graphics, unlike the computer originals with their vector lines. Enemy sprites are also more detailed and occupy a larger portion of the screen.

A pre-made party of six is available to the player right at the beginning, consisting of characters with generic names (&amp;quot;Fighter&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Samurai&amp;quot;, etc.); creating own characters (unlike in the modified PC Engine CD version of  Might and Magic), however, remains possible. Dungeon navigation is accompanied by orchestrated CD audio music in this version. The battle music is in PSG format.</resource>

Monsters attack his homeland, and he is forced to flee. After traveling by ship and arriving at the town Bolda, Areios finds out that strange things have been happening in the North Cave near the town. His first mission will be to venture to the North Cave and investigate the matter. Of course, soon Areios finds himself involved in a battle against sinister forces, and commences the longest and most dangerous adventure of his life!

The game is an action RPG set in the Dragon Slayer universe, with a gameplay style similar to  Falcom's other popular series, Ys. Controlling Areios, the player explores the top-down world, visiting towns and fighting monsters in vast outdoor areas and dungeons. Like in Ys series, it is sufficient to &amp;quot;bump&amp;quot; into a monster in order to inflict damage. Areios gains hit points and becomes stronger by sustaining damage from enemies and resting. His weapons and armor can gain experience and level up. In many areas, companions will join Areios and help him in combat, controlled by the computer AI.

The game is divided into chapters; the final stage of each chapter is a side-scrolling/platform level, which Areios has to navigate in order to reach the boss enemy, defeat him, and end the chapter. In such stages, the combat turns into a more familiar action-oriented style, with the player being required to press buttons in time in order to execute attacks and jump.

There is a day/night cycle in the game, manifested not only in graphical changes, but also in the schedules of townspeople: when it's dark, people will return to their homes and go to sleep, etc.</resource>

Once again, the player controls the adventurer Areios, who emerged victorious after the final battle in the end of the first game. Together with his friend Daimos, Areios is looking for their other friend, who has disappeared. On the way, their ship is attacked by the evil Dragon Riders. It seems the search won't be as easy as they have thought, as Areios gets involved in a dangerous adventure again.

The sequel is very similar to the first game gameplay-wise. The player explores towns, vast outdoor areas, and dungeons, engaging enemies in real-time combat. Damage is inflicted upon the enemies simply by running into them, without any special attack button. There are various weapons to equip, and they level up in proficiency the more the player uses them. Areios gains additional hit points depending on the damage he receives. Party members help him in battles, controlled by the AI. The day and night cycle of the previous game has been removed.

Like in the previous game, there are side-scrolling segments which lead to boss battles at the end of each chapter. Compared to the first game, these stages are noticeably shorter, each containing only the boss fight itself, omitting platforming sections with regular enemies. Bosses must be fought using conventional action gameplay, attacking by pressing a button and jumping to avoid their attacks. It is also possible to defend actively and perform attacks in different directions. The player may opt to fight the bosses alone or select one of the available companions, either AI-controlled or in two-player mode.</resource>

    <resource id="7bd7a8e6ceab44023803186b83d67c584b54bfef" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Wizardry III?IV contains two role-playing games from the Wizardry series: Legacy of Llylgamyn and The Return of Werdna. Both games were ported to the PC Engine (TurboGrafx) CD console with various enhancements, unreleased separately. The player automatically starts playing Legacy of Llylgamyn; playing The Return of Werdna can be accessed via &amp;quot;Utility&amp;quot; option in the town menu. Though the game(s) are rather faithful in gameplay and graphical design to the original computer versions, the enhancements are significant enough to consider this a remake. 

Unlike the computer originals with their vector lines, the dungeons have simple graphics now. Enemy sprites are also drawn in a more detailed fashion. A pre-made party of six is available to the player right at the beginning, consisting of characters with generic names (&amp;quot;Fighter&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Samurai&amp;quot;, etc.); creating own characters (unlike in the modified PC Engine CD version of Might and Magic), however, remains possible. Naturally, in The Return of Werdna the player controls Werdna himself and his summoned monsters. Another notable change is the inclusion of orchestrated CD audio music for dungeon navigation and (optionally) for battle music.</resource>

But a new threat has arisen: an enigmatic man named Glames from the Dark World, possessor of a sword named Leethus, is planning to conquer both Earth and Vecanti, convinced that there is no other way to save his world from imminent destruction. A young girl from the Dark World named Cham escapes from Glames, and asks Yuko to help her stop him with the aid of her Valis sword.

Like its predecessors in the series, Valis III is a side-scrolling platform action game. Unlike the previous installments, the player can control three characters in the game: Yuko, Cham (who uses a whip and fights similarly to Castlevania protagonists), and princess Valna from Vecanti, who is weaker physically, but can cast more powerful magic. Each of the characters can equip different weapons and has access to her own magic spells.</resource>

This time, this system is enhanced with the option of choosing between four different power-up sequences, allowing the player to use different types of weapons against enemies. There is also the possibility to gain options, which are mysterious balls of fire that follows the player-controlled spaceship closely and mimic all its movements (including shots). While the player only could have two of them in the NES version of Gradius, it is now possible in all versions to have up to four.</resource>

Out of nowhere, a sword appears in her hands. She fights the monsters who have suddenly invaded the city, and is summoned to the parallel world known as Vecanti, which is ruled by a cruel tyrant named Rogles, whose actions disrupt the balance of the the worlds. Wielding the legendary Valis sword, Yuko must defeat Rogles and restore the balance.

Valis has the same story and basic genre (platform action) as the  original first game in the  series; however, it is a different game with different locations, regular enemies and bosses, new cutscenes, etc.  Defeating the numerous enemies populating the game world requires precise usage of jumping and ducking abilities, and attack timing. Yuko can jump very high and attack while jumping. Various power-ups are scattered through the game, many of which enhance the performance of Yuko's sword. Acting as a melee weapon in the beginning, it can be customized with power-ups and turn into a medium-range weapon, firing shots at the enemies - with proper power-ups, also in different directions. Boss enemies typically have different attack patterns and require different strategies to defeat them.</resource>

Ry?-?ki is based on the manga and anime series Tenchi Muyo, in particular the 20-episode OVA Tenchi Muyo: Ryo-ohki (same name as the game, but with a slightly different official romanization). The story centers around a seemingly ordinary boy Tenchi Masaki, who lives in the countryside on the Earth. After accidentally releasing a spaced pirate named Ryoko, his modest house attracts the attention of powerful people from space, including an officer of the Galaxy Police, a famous scientist, and two sisters from a royal family in search of their long-lost half-brother. Soon Tenchi finds out the truth about his own identity and his super-powers, but still can't quite handle a household with five attractive young women, some of which seem to have a special interest in him...

The game is a traditional Japanese-style adventure: no puzzles, but many situations during which the player has to make choices. These choices lead to branching story lines, which in their turn lead to different endings. The game is viewed from first-person perspective, beside navigation around Tenchi's house, which uses a platform view.</resource>

    <resource id="75d95738052935dbc4ef75280b53beb6b8faf0fb" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">The story of Advanced V.G. follows a similar template as those of the previous  Variable Geo games: the strongest young women in the country hold a tournament, which is sponsored by various restaurant chains, which in turn ask the competing girls to pose as waitresses working in said restaurants, for promotional purposes. The girls of the Jahana group who starred in the previous games return, with the new main protagonist being the young martial artist Yuka Takeuchi, who has been training in a secluded forest area before joining the competition. 

Like its predecessors, Advanced V.G. is a fighting game, with the basic &amp;quot;kick&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;punch&amp;quot; moves, while the various special attacks are executed by pressing combinations of buttons. There are three modes in the game, &amp;quot;Normal&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Vs.&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;Story&amp;quot;. The normal mode is basically training matches between the player character and an AI-controlled girl. Vs. mode allows two-player mode, as well as demo &amp;quot;computer vs. computer&amp;quot; gameplay, with the possibility to choose any of the stages. Any of the nine heroines is available as a playable character in these modes (Yuka Takeuchi, Chiho Masuda, Jun Kubota, Manami Kusunoki. Kaori Yanase, Reimi Jahana, Satomi Yajima, Ayako Y?ki, and Erina Goldsmith). The story mode, on the other hand, allows the player to control Yuka Takeuchi only, and follow her story. Cut scenes advance the story between matches. 

The SNES received a stripped-down version, Super V.G., without the Story Mode and all explicit hentai elements. Hybrids (pair of bosses in Advanced V.G.) were also removed.</resource>

The game does not let the player completely control Goku, instead choosing whether he is on the offense, defense, powering up, or running.

Street punks and leaders of Chinese crime syndicates dominate the area where its headquarters are supposedly located. The young fighter Hawk has his own score to settle with the Dragon Zone: they have kidnapped his girlfriend Candy. Together with his friend, the punk Tony, Hawk enters the dangerous districts and is determined to rescue his sweetheart and put an end to the organization.

Riot Zone (Crest of Wolf in Japan) is a rather simple brawler in which the player can choose to control either Hawk or Tony. Hawk is faster, but doesn't hit quite as hard as Tony. Both characters fight entirely unarmed, using kicks and punches to deal with the enemies; both also possess a powerful all-screen attack that depletes a portion of their health bar. Each stage culminates with a boss battle as Hawk and Tony gradually defeat the &amp;quot;wanted&amp;quot; criminals of the city.</resource>

    <resource id="390eb72c8e775318938ca8f1c317c0fbaf48a3fd" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">An asteroid is nearing the planet Neo Kenya. Scientists warn that the planet might be completely annihilated by it. In a most unexpected turn of events, a deity known as Anubis spoke to people and asked them to save the planet's animals before the asteroids hit it. Anubis sent the humans a huge ship - a magnified version of Noah's Ark - and demanded that one man and one woman should dedicate their time to saving the animals. A whole special team has been assigned to the project. Ken is one of the youngest members of the team, and he is sent on the grand mission to save the animals, together with his childhood sweetheart, the lovely Linda. 

This somewhat unusual premise translated itself into the gameplay mechanics. Though  Linda³ is first and foremost a Japanese-style RPG - with top-down &amp;quot;world map&amp;quot;, towns, turn-based combat, simple leveling up, focus on narrative and characters, and so on - it also has gameplay features rarely seen among games of its genre.

There are no random enemies in the game; they are visibly walking on the screen, and a contact with them triggers familiar turn-based battles (viewed from first-person perspective). Hostile animals should not be killed, but captured. They can be then used in towns for a variety of purposes, including weapon and armor enhancement, food, etc.  

Animal saving is pivotal to the game's plot progression; in fact, at the very beginning of the game, the game offers three selectable difficulty levels, which are determined by the amount of animals Ken must save in order to complete the mission.

Beside hostile animals, there are also certain types of animals (such as dogs) that will join the party and fight alongside Ken and Linda.</resource>

One day, following a monster attack on the village, Eple and her penguin friend fell into the water and drifted to faraway lands. The duo must face fearsome enemies and dangers to find a way back home.

Travel Eple is a top-down action game similar in concept to Bomberman. The game is divided into stages, each consisting of one screen. Every stage has an opponent who tries to kill Eple either by attacking directly (most regular enemies only have close-range attacks, but bosses may not follow this rule), or by throwing objects at her. Eple, on the other hand, has no attacks on her own and must rely on these objects (mostly explosives such as bombs and grenades) to hurt the enemy. Objects keep appearing randomly in various parts of the screen as long as the battle continues.

Stages may contain hazardous areas that damage Eple, or other spots that prevent her from walking around normally. Health-restoring pots also pop up from time to time. A few stages require Eple to access a magic staff, which grants her various protective abilities (e.g. an ice force field that absorbs fire damage). 

A versus mode is available, in which players compete against each other by controlling Eple and her friend Pal. Their magical abilities can be customized before the battle begins.</resource>

Blood Gear is a role-playing game with action-based combat. The general gameplay system is somewhat similar to that of the Exile series: town exploration is performed from the standard &amp;quot;RPG-like&amp;quot; top-down view, while all hostile areas are presented as side-scrolling levels, sometimes with elaborate platform structures. Both melee and ranged weapons (pistols, assault rifles, laser guns, etc.) can be purchased in stores and/or found while exploring hostile areas. Health is restored with repair kits of various efficiency, which can also be purchased, found, or randomly dropped by enemies.</resource>

    <resource id="c7602845b59adcafb1dbd9813e6cae1cadd9904e" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Auto Crusher Palladium is a game that simulates construction of battle robots (&amp;quot;mechs&amp;quot;). The player is able to construct robots using various parts: body, limbs, computer AI, weapons, etc. The result can be a combination of any forms and components, with the limitation being the overall weight of the robot, which must not exceed a specified amount. Robots can be humanoid, machine-like, rolling on wheels, able to fly or transform into different forms, etc.

After a robot has been created, the player sends it to fight other robots. The battles look like those of a fighting game, with side-scrolling view and HP bars; however, they are non-interactive. The entire gameplay focus in on creating a robot in such a way that it would be able to defeat a particular enemy; the battles themselves allow no control from the side of the player.

A &amp;quot;league mode&amp;quot; is also available, where the player(s) choose various models of robots and have them compete against each other in a tournament.</resource>

Human beings spread out to different planets of the Milky Way. The hero of the game is a young pilot named Harry. He was testing the newest spacecraft model, but it crash-landed on Menaris, a planet at the outskirts of the Eva solar system, with a medieval-like civilization. Turns out that repairing the ship will be anything but easy, so Harry decides to stay for a while and to help the inhabitants of Menaris with their problems, which involve the over-ambitious Doran Empire. With the help of Aria, princess of Menaris, Harry must discover the truth about Doran's intentions, and when he learns it, he realizes that he won't use the repaired ship to return home, but will have to face something that threatens the entire galaxy.

Star Breaker is a fairly traditional Japanese RPG, with top-down view, world map navigation, random turn-based battles, and all the other usual ingredients. Battles can be set on Auto for quicker pacing. Since the setting of the game is a mixture of sci-fi and medieval fantasy, character use a variety of weapons from swords to guns, as well as special psychic attacks. There are also some space ship combat in the game, and it is possible to upgrade the player's ship later on.</resource>

One day, four magical orbs fell into the hands of a student named Rin-Rin. The clumsy girl managed to lose all of them, without understanding what this could lead to:  nobody knows what will happen if the orbs fall into wrong hands - those of the dark goddesses! Aided by a little fairy named Pop, Rin-Rin has to gather the legendary goddesses and to find a way to retrieve the orbs.

Megami Tengoku is based on an anime of the same name (translated as Megami Paradise). It plays like a traditional top-down Japanese RPG with turn-based combat. Rin-Rin uses magical spells to fight enemies. An unusual feature of the game is the ability to change clothes, and the fact that every dress changes the graphical appearance of the character.</resource>

    <resource id="d775b8ba1243f4cac00d2542f65b2648805bf28a" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Minesweeper is a minesweeping game, just like the one included in every copy of Microsoft Windows since ancient times. On a grid, the player clicks in a cell and hopes that it is not occupied with a mine. If it isn't, that cell is filled with a number, which indicates how many mines there are in adjacent cells. Using logical thinking, looking at the relations between different number cells, the player can conclude which cells contain a mine and mark them as such. Once all cells are revealed, the player progresses to the next minefield.

Three main game modes are available, differentiated by the size of the minefield: 9x7, 12x12 and 18x14. Clearing a minefield takes the player to another one of the same size, but with more bombs to clear.

A second mode is a mission mode (&amp;quot;voyage mode&amp;quot; in the PC Engine version), where the player is presented with 10 minefields each in 7 locations around the world. The first ones are very small, only 4x4, growing larger and larger from then on. What is different about the mission mode is that a few cells in the minefield are revealed from the start, putting the player's ability of deduction at test. The editor mode allows players to construct a minefield of their own, by inputting parameters of size and amount of bombs.

The Game Boy version can also be played by two players via a link cable. The PC Engine (TurboGrafx CD) version contains an additional mode entitled &amp;quot;Cook's Quest&amp;quot;, in which the player has to help a cook to escape from falling boulders in a cave, represented by mines on a familiar minesweeper field.</resource>

L-DIS is a horizontally scrolling shoot-em-up with cartoon-like visuals and humorous overtones. The player can choose between three different weapon setups in the beginning. Power-ups are obtained by shooting little winged yellow creatures encountered in the stages. These power-ups rapidly change properties and can either enhance the strength of the main weapon, add a secondary one, or grant the protagonist protective shields or bombs that can eliminate all the enemies on the screen. Bosses and mini-bosses are present in most of the levels.</resource>

    <resource id="e067085549c9801bddadc18ed75ca22003ba1850" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Digital Comic Patlabor is based on the anime series Patlabor. In the near future, officers of Tokyo Metropolitan Police pilot giant robots called &amp;quot;Labors&amp;quot; to combat criminals. Like most installments of the anime and manga, the game focuses on characters from Special Vehicle Section 2, Division 2, and the playable character is Noa Izumi. More specifically, the game follows the so-called &amp;quot;TV timeline&amp;quot;, involving the Labor Griffon.

The gameplay is that of a traditional Japanese-style adventure. Three commands ? Look, Talk, and Move ? appear on every screen. The player selects these commands (there are no sub-menus with objects) to move between locations, examine rooms, talk to characters, and ultimately advance the storyline. The game also contains a variety of features (robot database, interviews with voice actors, etc.) accessible from the main menu, as well as a rock-paper-scissors mini-game starring various Labors.</resource>

The &amp;quot;RPG mode&amp;quot; follows the story of an apprentice &amp;quot;mahjong warrior&amp;quot;, a girl named Chi Fou, who is sent on a quest to defeat monsters that were unleashed on the world. This mode is structured like a traditional medieval top-down RPG, with town and dungeon exploration, NPC interaction, and other familiar elements. The protagonist can equip weapons and armor, cast magic, and purchase healing and status-recovering items. Experience points and money are awarded after each battle.

Random and boss battles in this mode are standard mahjong games, with the addition of special tiles that influence the game's result, e.g. increase the damage inflicted by the equipped weapon. The final damage is calculated after the mahjong game is over, and depends on the characters' levels, equipment, and the winning combination. For example, winning the game with a full mahjong would most likely result in a &amp;quot;critical hit&amp;quot;. Boss enemies typically take two or more rounds of mahjong to defeat.

In addition, the game features a versus mode, which allows the player to compete in mahjong games against the opponents of the RPG mode, with weapons, equipment, and level parameters playing no role. These opponents appear as monsters at first, but are revealed to be pretty young women who remove parts of their clothes when losing a mahjong round; stripping down to underwear equals defeat. Despite this feature, there is no explicit nudity in the game.</resource>

The captain of the king's knights, Robin Solford, witnesses the dragon's attack on the castle. His two comrades are killed, and the princess Patricia, Robin's adoptive sister, is nowhere to be seen. Robin is determined to find Patricia and stop Dr. Killbait, and begins to wander around the world, hoping to find friends who will help him on his perilous journey.

Startling Odyssey II: Mary? Sens? is not a sequel, but a prequel to the  first game, Robin Solford being the father of the previous game's hero. The game is set in a predominantly medieval fantasy-themed world with a touch of sci-fi, and plays like a traditional Japanese RPG. The player navigates a party of characters on a top-down overworld, visiting cities and dungeon-like areas. Enemies are encountered randomly. Battles are viewed from isometric perspective, with an &amp;quot;auto&amp;quot; option to speed up combat. 

Characters join the party as dictated by the plot; the party will eventually contain four active combatants. Each character has his or her own sets of offensive, supporting, or healing spells, which are learned automatically when the character levels up. The game features full-screen anime-style cutscenes and voice acting during important events.</resource>

The game's graphics were drawn by the manga artist Izumi Takemoto. The setting is 23rd century, and the player has to take care of three girls from different planets: Naomi, Hikaru, and Edalt. The goal is to make the girls successfully perform their working duties (mostly secretary-like assignments), at the same time having free time to rest. With each activity, certain parameters (stamina, intelligence, etc.) of the girl will increase and decrease. Since the three girls have different parameters from the beginning, it is important to understand their personalities and to find the right balance between work and leisure. The girls also have a &amp;quot;loyalty&amp;quot; parameter, that usually increases when the player lets them have a day off. </resource>

Text and gameplay remain largely the same. The verb commands are now represented by graphical icons, but object sub-menus look exactly the same as in the original version, and generally the gameplay progression hasn't been changed.</resource>

Ezara Satsujin Jiken is based on a series on a series of novels by the Japanese detective fiction author Misa Yamamura. The popular protagonist of the novels, inspector S?suke Kariya, appears in the game as one of the characters; but the main heroine and the player character is Yuko Kobayakawa, a journalist working for a gourmet magazine. During a trip to Kyoto she attends a party and witnesses a mysterious murder of a wealthy man's estranged wife. Yoko decides to stay and help the authorities investigate the crime.

The game plays like a puzzle-less Japanese-style adventure. Most of the time the player chooses a location to travel to and interrogates characters, selecting various topics from a list. Such scenes are presented in first-person view. A few segments, however, feature third-person navigation with point-and-click interaction, similar to Western adventures. Other instances require the player to move a cursor on a zoomed object to interact with it in a detailed way.</resource>

The game involved gathering at night, lighting a hundred candles and telling horror stories, extinguishing the candles one by one until the room became completely dark.

The game contains a hundred horror stories told in a linear fashion through text, digitized photos and sound effects. Most of the stories are very short and non-interactive. The exceptions usually involve visual novel-like choices of locations or responses to situations, which sometimes affect the story's conclusion. A recurrent episode involves visiting various locations in Tokyo area and reviewing criminal cases and ghost stories.

The next morning he found out that the new teacher looked very similar to the woman he saw. After overhearing a conversation, K?suke realizes that the new teacher is in fact a detective sent to investigate the murder of a female student that occurred in the gym. The young man has to play his cards right in order to become part of the investigation, solve the mystery, and perhaps impress the attractive teacher in other ways.

Himitsu no Hanazono is essentially a visual novel. There are no verb commands and no real interaction with the environment. The choices are rather frequent and fairly numerous (usually four or five choices at most screens). Most of these choices, however, do not affect the plot, though they may alter subsequent dialogue. The player is also able to navigate the protagonist on school grounds and inside the main building in a top-down fashion, visiting locations in any order.</resource>

In the early 21th century humanity discovered a race of bug-like aliens while colonizing known space. The aliens steadily advance towards the Earth with the goal of eradicating it. To counter that, humans have developed giant mechas that ca be navigated by trained pilots. The story of the game follows closely the first chapter of the anime, focusing on the young pilot Noriko Takaya and her first steps towards the mastery of her dangerous profession.

The game has a Japanese-style adventure-like interface (with Look, Talk, and other verb commands leading to sub-menus), but plays more like a cross between an interactive movie (with animated scenes and voice-overs) and a visual novel, where choices of actions and responses play a dominant role. Every wrong action raises the heroine's &amp;quot;stress meter&amp;quot;; once it is full, the game is over.</resource>

One day, a magical error occurs, and Y? finds herself on Earth. In order to return to her world, the little fairy must find three stones that must be inserted into her magical brooch. A young girl who finds the first stone becomes Y?'s companion (and the game's protagonist), and together they must find and recover the other stones.

Pastel Lime is a Japanese-style adventure with simple gameplay. Only a few commands (sometimes just one) usually appear on the screen, and the player's input is mostly reduced to selecting these commands several times to trigger the next scene. Sub-menus (such as conversation topics) may appear as well. Game progression is strictly linear, and the player has no choice of selecting locations to travel to.</resource>

Criminal organizations began using advanced science in order to escape into different time periods to avoid capture. To counter that, a special police unit called &amp;quot;Burning Rabbits&amp;quot; was formed, consisting of four young ladies who bravely pilot their fighter craft through time and space.

Ginga Fukei Densetsu: Sapphire is a vertically-scrolling shoot-em-up. The player can choose between four different female characters, each piloting a different ship: Sapphire has balanced strength is speed; Charlotte is the fastest, but also the weakest; Helen is the slowest and the strongest; Jasmine is the second-strongest and the second-slowest. The ships are also distinguished by their weapon properties. Each ship can collect red, green, or blue power-ups; collecting a power-up of the same color enhances the currently equipped weapon, while a differently-colored power-up changes weapon properties while retaining whatever enhancements the ship might have had with the previous weapon. The actual properties of each weapon is different for each ship, and include various combinations of lasers, beams, missiles, piercing and homing weapons.

Each ship also has two pods on the sides that fire simultaneously. If the player releases the fire button for five seconds, the pods will charge up and damage enemies with electricity during the next shot. In additions, the ships can also drop bombs that heavily damage all the enemies on the screen; up to two bombs can be carried at the same time. The stages include various themes such as medieval, feudal China, ancient Egypt, etc., all with a strong sci-fi angle. The player can continue up to nine times from the same spot if the protagonist runs out of lives, and additional continues are granted when the player gathers a sufficient amount of points.</resource>

The plot involves a kidnapping of a little girl by the mafia, and the attempts of a boy named Hoshimaru to rescue her, all the while escaping from an impending apocalypse. Hoshimaru can be navigated over a board (often with branching paths); each field usually leads to a conversation scene with a following quiz. Both Hoshimaru and the &amp;quot;enemies&amp;quot; have life bars; the protagonist's health increases after successfully completed quiz challenges. Correct answers damage the enemy, while wrong answers deplete the hero's life. The amount of possible answer to select from and the nature of trivia questions varies from quest to quest.

Other modes include a multiplayer tournament, a time attack mode in which players have to answer as many questions as possible within a time limit, and two multiplayer modes that allows players to represent various characters and mimic a fighting game and a Formula 1 Grand Prix.</resource>

One day he is entrusted with an important task of watching over his relative, a little girl. However, as soon as his girlfriend appears, the hero neglects his duty and very soon finds out that the little girl has disappeared. He has to explore the school building and find her at all costs.

The player can choose the order in which the protagonist visits various classrooms in the school. In each room there is a young and attractive girl who asks the hero a series of timed trivia questions on different topics (predominantly popular culture). Both the protagonist and the girls have certain amounts of hit points; a correct answer diminishes the opponent's HP by one, while a wrong one depletes the protagonist's health by the same amount. </resource>

The game assumes familiarity with the story of the anime, taking the player directly into the time frame of late episodes, where Grandis and the jewel thieves have already joined Jean and Nadia on their travels with Captain Nemo on his submarine &amp;quot;Nautilus&amp;quot;. Following a dramatic scene that reveals more about Electra's past, the crew is stranded on a mysterious island. Jean, Nadia, Marie, and the lion cub King decide to explore it, and discover an ancient civilization in the process.

The game plays mostly like an interactive comic book or a visual novel, though it does contain adventure elements such as verb commands. However, these commands are usually very sparse, and there are no sub-menus with objects or people to interact with. The game advances linearly, and the player's input is for the most part reduced to choosing between several locations to explore first. There is also a separate quiz mode where the player answers trivia questions asked by characters from the series.</resource>

Several modes may be accessed from the main menu, most of which lead to visual presentations and descriptions of various dinosaurs. Individual dinosaur data can be accessed by viewing geological periods and geographical areas (e.g. China of the Cretaceous period) and selecting dinosaurs appearing on the screen; browsing a dinosaur list alphabetically; viewing a genealogical tree; and finally viewing dinosaurs by phylum and family.

Most areas can be scrolled to the sides and some of the dinosaurs present themselves with voice-overs. There is also a variety section that allows viewing various dinosaur-related records and specifications (such as the tallest dinosaurs, inhabitants of cold areas, etc.). Another section is dedicated to animated sequences depicting various locations and dinosaurs.</resource>

Harnessing its power, the Demon Folk grew stronger, and started attacking peace-loving tribes and their villages. One warrior of the bunny-eared Monbit tribe stood up against the demons. Riding a dragon, he entered the palace of the Demon King and shattered the magic amulet he was wearing. However, the warrior was gravely wounded himself. He entrusted the amulet with the tribe elder. Years have passed, and the demons are once again rearing their ugly heads. The young hero is the only one who can save the world - by using the magic amulet's power, and by befriending a dragon...

Seiry? Densetsu Monbit is a traditional fantasy-themed Japanese-style RPG, with the typical progression scheme: the player navigates the hero (and other characters who join the party later) on the top-down overworld map, enters towns, buys weapons and armor, and fights randomly appearing enemies in first-person perspective, turn-based combat. One stand-out gameplay feature is the dragon egg the hero carries from the beginning of the game. As time passes, a dragon will be born, and assist the hero in various ways. For example, even as an egg, the dragon can serve as a healing item that replenishes a small amount of hit points.</resource>

This interpretation of Ryuusuke Mita's manga Dragon Half is entirely different from the  computer version. It is a combination of a board game and an RPG. Up to 4 players can compete, each controlling a party of characters from the manga. The navigation takes place on a large board, and is controlled by dice rolls. The player can advance only as many steps as the number on the dice; however, most of the board has many different paths and crossroads, which allows certain freedom of movement and planning. 

Different spots on the board have a variety of effects on the party. Red-colored spots lead to turn-based enemy encounters. The player must press a button in time to choose an attack by a specific party member, and also to determine its strength. Experience points are rewarded after battles, and the characters level up in a fashion similar to other Japanese RPGs.

Other places on the board include damage traps, shops, trigger meetings with other characters, lead to healing spots such as pools and hotels.</resource>

This incarnation of the series is essentially a real-time strategy game with a somewhat unusual approach to the genre. Rather than navigating units on battlefields, the player takes direct control of every crew member onboard the ship. Each one of them is responsible for a certain function (supplying power, manning a gun, turning the ship, etc.); in order to win battles, it is crucial to coordinate their actions. The game proceeds in real time, but pauses when the player accesses crew members and performs actions for them.</resource>

As a soldier you don a &amp;quot;New Age Power Suit&amp;quot; and have a choice of playing several different characters, though it is only a one player game.

The object of the game is to fight an enemy army led by &amp;quot;ZOD&amp;quot; who is a mass murderer and killed some of your commando friends. There are various armaments and shields that you can pick up along the way. There are several manga-style animation sequences in the game.

This is the sequel to a Mega Drive game called Final Zone which was released in 1990 also.</resource>

In each area there are casinos with pachinko machines. The player can talk to characters in the casino, exchange money for chips and vice versa, and play pachinko on variously themed machines. New areas become accessible after the player has won a sufficient amount of money in the previous casino.</resource>

    <resource id="4a433047170a158d13c809f3974ed940784d1451" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Based on the manga and subsequent anime series Yawara: A Fashionable Judo Girl, this game can be considered a sequel to  Yawara!, since its events take place after the conclusion of the previous story line. This time, the player controls Fujiko Itou, one of the original series' heroines, an admirer of Yawara. After having won a major international competition, Yawara feels she cannot bear the fame, longing to return to normal life and leave judo. Shocked by this decision, Fujiko decides to train herself and become a judo master, in order to convince Yawara to come back.

Unlike the previous game, which was entirely a &amp;quot;digital comic&amp;quot;, Yawara 2 has three different gameplay modes. The Japanese-style adventure part plays similarly to the predecessor and to most other games of this style: the player has a few verbs to choose from a menu; choosing all of them one-by-one invariably advances the story. This part is heavy on non-interactive cut scenes.

Another gameplay mode is a quiz featuring questions related to the original series; the player has to choose the correct answer among four available ones, and a wrong answer leads to instant Game Over.

Finally, the so-called &amp;quot;Battle&amp;quot; gameplay mode is a judo fighting game. It plays similarly to other fighting games (even with its own story, versus, and two-player modes), but instead of the usual punches, kicks, jumps, and special moves, the player is only allowed to execute authentic judo moves and play by the rules. Many moves involve rapid pressing of different buttons. The player controls Fujiko, and in the versus mode is able to choose to fight fictional champions from the original story line.

Beside these gameplay modes, the game features an extensive Yawara!-related database, with character profiles, information, and even the titular heroine giving a cooking lesson.</resource>

On the outskirts of the town stands the Weathertop mansion. It was just an ordinary place until the last owner, Benedict Weathertop, started practicing black magic. He killed his parents and populated the mansion with all kinds of undead. Since then, nobody dared to approach the mansion. But a short while ago, two boys were found dead near this horrible place. Apparently, the boys had tried to enter the mansion. Another evidence pointed out that a girl followed them - but her body hasn't been found yet, and there is a slight hope she might be alive. This is where you, the hero of the game, decide to investigate the mystery, and to venture into the mansion...

Laplace no Ma is a Japanese-style RPG with horror elements. You are not stuck in the mansion, but can leave it, visit the town, and buy supplies. Later you also visit other locations such as a castle, etc.</resource>

    <resource id="5e820e883a28636c25787ca9a5fd312e4044f57c" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">A young man lives together with his mother in Kichijoji, a district in modern Tokyo. One day, he has a strange dream: he is being sucked into another dimension, a strange maze-like structure. A spirit appears in front of him and asks him his name. As he proceeds further, he meets a man who is hanging on a cross, another one who is being tormented by a demon, and a mysterious young woman who is bathing in a pool.

&amp;quot;Wake up!&amp;quot; - the voice of his mother cuts through the dream. The young man wakes up and checks his computer. Suddenly, a message arrives: the world is headed towards destruction. Only he who can summon demons through a virtual space will be able to prevent a disaster. Unable to understand what that means, the young man goes outside and finds out a murder has occurred in the nearby park. The district must be cut off from the rest of the city until the murderer is found. As the young man acquires a device that allows him to communicate with demons, he begins to realize that his role in the upcoming events may be greater than he thought.

A follow-up to the first two Megami Tensei games, Shin Megami Tensei is a first-person RPG set in modern-day and post-apocalyptic Tokyo. The hero of the game can summon demons, who consume a mysterious energy called Magnetite, which can be obtained from battles. The summoned demon joins the party and is then fully controllable by the player. The active party can include up to six characters: the hero, the heroine, and four slots usually reserved for the demons, though other human characters might also join. There is a wide variety of demons in the game, most of which are taken from real-world mythologies. The demons have levels, individual statistics, spells, special abilities, etc.

Enemy encounters are random, and the first-person combat is turn-based. During combat, human characters can use swords or guns; the heroine is also able to learn and cast magic spells. Unlike most other Japanese RPGs, the game allows the player to raise the parameters of the two main characters manually when leveling up. A major gameplay element are demon conversations, which is usually the only way to recruit demons. Typically, the player has to convince the demon to join the party by choosing appropriate dialogue lines. 

All the creatures in the world of Shin Megami Tensei belong to one of the three ideologies: Law, Chaos, or Neutral. The narrative is largely dedicated to conflicts between these ideologies; during several key moments in the story, the player has to decide which one to follow. Joining one of the ideologies influences the subsequent narrative as well as some gameplay elements: certain weapons can be only equipped by a follower of a specific ideology, demons are more likely to join the hero if he shares their ideology, etc.</resource>

Up to five players can compete in the races. All the stages are vertically-scrolling (top-down), with the cars represented as small sprites of different colors. The player's goal is not only to beat the other cars, but also reach the finish line safely: each car has limited hit points, and continuously receives damage during the race.

Damage can be sustained by driving over environmental hazards (pits, traps, bombs, etc.), failing to move the car forward in time (if the screen scrolls while the player-controlled car is at the bottom, it takes damage), being hit by the many enemies encountered in the game (which include a wide variety of wild animals, humans, fantasy creatures, monsters, etc.), or being hit by a competing car. Cars have the ability to jump over obstacles or enemy fire, avoiding damage.

Over the course of the races, cars accumulate points depending on their results. These points can be invested in purchasing a limited amount of destructive weaponry (missiles, bombs, &amp;quot;boxing glove&amp;quot; that hits enemies from the side, oil to drop behind the car, etc.) or protective measures.</resource>

The game follows the same story for the most part, and contains the cut scenes from the original version. Like most PC Engine (TurboGrafx) CD games, it features voice acting during cut scenes and CD audio tracks.

Several cut scenes were added, and some dialogues expanded. Though the story progression and the areas the characters have to traverse in order to advance it remain intact most of the time, the gameplay system has received an overhaul, being essentially developed from scratch. The &amp;quot;RPG-lite&amp;quot; feel of the original version is now somewhat compensated by the ability to equip weapons and armor, as in most RPGs. Combat engine has also been modified; instead of the isometric battle screens of the original, the battles are now viewed from &amp;quot;over-the-shoulder&amp;quot; third-person perspective, with player-controlled characters visibly attacking the foes, similarly to  Phantasy Star IV.</resource>

    <resource id="c8d543eea162e4b9cab7ef68c6a024dd95434d40" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Some day in the near future, the crew of an &amp;quot;idol&amp;quot; (a popular culture star) takes a ride on the bus through the countryside. One of the female crew members unexpectedly faints and is taken by her friends into an abandoned mansion discovered nearby. Very soon, however, the accident begins to repeat itself, and evidence of a gruesome murder and possible ghostly presence in the mansion surfaces. Mei Star, an investigator with the team, and her computerized holographic assistant Navi must solve the mystery before it becomes too late.

Private eye dol is an adventure game played for the most part from a top-down perspective. The player navigates Mei around the playable environment, examines places and items of interest, and talks to other characters. With a few exceptions, there are no puzzles in the game, and the plot is advanced by triggering events. On several occasions items must be picked up, but they are used automatically in correspondent locations.</resource>

In this football (soccer) game players can choose between competing for the World Cup or participating in the Japanese league tournament.

Before a match begins players can choose between three general strategies for the team - normal, offensive, or defensive. Weather conditions (normal, rain, or snow) and match length can be selected as well. The game itself is played from a third-person perspective that slightly switches between isometric and top-down depending on the situation. </resource>

The gameplay is similar to the previous game, the player being allowed only to make a choice occasionally; however, in this game the player chooses various S&amp;M &amp;quot;instruments&amp;quot;, and has to keep an eye on the &amp;quot;pleasure meter&amp;quot; in order to achieve the best ending. The game can be therefore considered a &amp;quot;sex simulation&amp;quot;.</resource>

One day, his home villages is attacked by monsters. His best friend is killed, and the most powerful magician of the village is turned into stone and abducted by the monsters' leader. Leon receives the blessing of the village elder and begins his quest to avenge the death of his friend and to defeat the demonic forces that threaten the land.

The game is a rather traditional Japanese RPG, with all the familiar ingredients: Leon (and his companions who later join the party) roams the world map, entering towns and dungeons, buying equipment and items, and engaging randomly appearing enemies in turn-based combat. The battles are viewed from first-person perspective. Characters can use regular attacks as well as magical spells, and the battles can be also set on Auto.</resource>

Monsters attack his homeland, and he is forced to flee. After traveling by ship and arriving at the town Bolda, Areios finds out that strange things have been happening in the North Cave near the town. His first mission will be to venture to the North Cave and investigate the matter. Of course, soon Areios finds himself involved in a battle against sinister forces, and commences the longest and most dangerous adventure of his life!

The game is an action RPG set in the Dragon Slayer universe, with a gameplay style similar to  Falcom's other popular series, Ys. Controlling Areios, the player explores the top-down world, visiting towns and fighting monsters in vast outdoor areas and dungeons. Like in Ys series, it is sufficient to &amp;quot;bump&amp;quot; into a monster in order to inflict damage. Areios gains hit points and becomes stronger by sustaining damage from enemies and resting. His weapons and armor can gain experience and level up. In many areas, companions will join Areios and help him in combat, controlled by the computer AI.

The game is divided into chapters; the final stage of each chapter is a side-scrolling/platform level, which Areios has to navigate in order to reach the boss enemy, defeat him, and end the chapter. In such stages, the combat turns into a more familiar action-oriented style, with the player being required to press buttons in time in order to execute attacks and jump.

There is a day/night cycle in the game, manifested not only in graphical changes, but also in the schedules of townspeople: when it's dark, people will return to their homes and go to sleep, etc.</resource>

The main character uses his sword most of the time to defeat his enemies. But he can also charge up and throw knives. RUN can also launch a mystical attack. But use those wisely as they are only available in a limited quantities. As expected in this sort of game, a boss awaits for you at the end of each stage and unlocks new powers and weapons when defeated.</resource>

Activities include battle training, gymnastics, running, resting, etc. All the activities are displayed as small animated segments on the same screen.</resource>

Both games play very similarly: the player has to roll dice in order to navigate his/her alter ego on a board with medieval/fantasy backgrounds.

The player has to answer a series of questions within a time limit, choosing the right answer among the several (usually four) available ones. The themes of the questions are varied, ranging from history and geography to Japanese popular culture and very specific themes (such as bicycles). Two-player gameplay is also possible.</resource>

The basic gameplay premise is very simple: shoot and jump your way through large amounts of monsters, defeat the boss, proceed to the next level. There is no narrative of any kind in the game, and no cut scenes; the hero is a tough-looking  Duke Nukem-look-alike equipped with guns. 

The screen is scrolling at all times, even if the player character doesn't move. The levels are almost entirely linear, the only choice sometimes being to stay on the ground or jump to the higher platforms. Cooperative two-player mode is available.

Though shooting is decidedly the main gameplay element here, jumping (particularly double-jumping) must be used liberally to navigate the hero through platform-based stages, and avoid and kill enemies (since jumping on their heads eliminates them as well). Weapons can be switched by catching power-ups, which appear as floating, constantly changing letters. Depending on the letter the player decides to take, the hero will get different weapons. These weapons include: a steady energy beam of moderate power; flamethrower; bombs; a short-distance grenade launcher of sorts; and a gun that spits fireballs in three different directions.

As the name implies, the game has a horror theme. The game begins in what looks like old Japan, complete with traditional Japanese demons, but later switches to more &amp;quot;mainstream&amp;quot; horror, complete with haunted towns, ghosts, zombies, skeletons, etc.</resource>

    <resource id="bec8bd7b7b1fd1aa546743427fe66a669af898a3" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Loom was the fourth game to use the SCUMM scripting language. The game follows Bobbin Threadbare as he learns how to use his magical powers through his distaff and as he eventually saves the world from the Lord of Chaos, who was unraveling the Loom (the source of power for the members of the weaver's guild).

Loom is an adventure game that sets itself apart from other titles in the genre through its unique gameplay system: the player character does not carry items around, but rather manipulates objects through the use of spells (called &amp;quot;drafts&amp;quot; in the game). The drafts themselves are woven by playing magical notes on a special instrument called &amp;quot;distaff&amp;quot;. All the puzzles in the game are solved by learning and correctly applying these drafts. 

Although the PC Engine version is CD based, it isn't a port of the PC CD-ROM version. Instead, it features mixed visuals from the 16- and 256-color versions adapted to the PC Engine's color palette and enhanced CD soundtrack with no spoken dialogue.</resource>

Unlike the previous game, Kager? no Toki contains no supernatural forces (demons), and instead focuses on concrete events of the Sengoku period in Japan, more exactly 16th century, a period of Japanese history that was marked by continuous wars and famous leaders such as Oda Nobunaga or Tokugawa Ieyasu.

The game offers more strategic possibilities than the previous installments of the series. Choosing a region of Japan and its leader, the player can perform a variety of activities, both in his country and towards other leaders. Diplomacy includes negotiation, signing contracts and peace treaties, etc. 

Battles are also more in-depth than before; instead of semi-automatic encounters battles occur on a separate map, on which the player has to actively navigate his unit, before he engages the enemy in close combat.</resource>

Like in other games of this genre, some fields bestow benefits on the player (e.g. award him money or items, invite the player to participate in bonus games, etc.). Most fields, however, lead to mahjong rounds against digitized young women, which have to be won in order to advance. Photos of scantily clad women in seductive poses serve as a reward for victory. A four-player mahjong mode is also available.</resource>

The game also contains a third mode which has nothing to do with mahjong: players select actresses who then begin to dance; players have to press buttons at the right moment to execute dancing moves. Actresses appear topless in these dances.</resource>

Tantei Divan - Shutsud?-hen, the game continues the overarching plot, following the events of the previous game. The evil alien Dora and his sexy female demonic minions are descending on Earth, sending their subordinates to stop Divan and Marie. Divan must use his robot transformation abilities to defeat them, which can only be done when playing mahjong.

The mahjong gameplay in this installment of the series is identical to that of its predecessor, including points distribution and execution of powerful transformation moves to gain the upper hand in the round. Unlike the previous games in the series, this chapter eschews the rudimentary adventure gameplay, featuring long non-interactive cutscenes between mahjong matches. Another change is the addition of a new mode that allows the player to compete against opponents from the story mode at any time, without going through the story.

Honj?, has been kidnapped by someone unknown. Unable to go to the police, the girl's sister, Mai, hires a private investigator to find out what happened to her. The only piece of evidence is a photograph from the night of Y?'s disappearance, where the missing girl and three other students from the same school are playing a game of mahjong.

Jantei Monogatari is a hybrid of a traditional-style Japanese adventure game and a regular mahjong game. The player takes the role of the unnamed private investigator, and moves from place to place via menus, talking to different characters. The investigation happens through playing mahjong with each suspect: win and they'll tell you a bit more of what they know. At first, the investigator can only speak with the three girls in the photo, but as he wins games of mahjong against them, he gains information and experience that allow him to find new clues and talk to more suspects. The investigator will need to play against a dozen different opponents in his attempt to find out what happened to the kidnapped girl.</resource>

Three cosmic spirits have lost their way in space and have to descend onto Earth, taking corporeal form. They enter the bodies of three young women who died recently: one in a traffic accident, another from disease, and the third one - a ten-year-old girl - after committing suicide. All three were avid mahjong players, and all three are now revived and endowed with mysterious mahjong powers. A special Mahjong Academy opens, and the Saver Angels (as the group begins calling itself) is ready to defeat any aliens and demons in that ancient Chinese game.

Saver Angels restores adventure elements that were absent from the previous game, and even enhances them. The player is now able to move in first-person perspective by pointing and clicking on a spot on the screen. Exploring locations, the player triggers scenes, which in turn lead to mahjong games. A special &amp;quot;mahjong mode&amp;quot; allows the player to choose an opponent from the story mode and challenge her (or him) to a mahjong match right away.</resource>

There is no background story in the game; the player is merely introduced to three high school girls - Mizuki, Aya, and Akira - who challenge him to the game of mahjong. The main mahjong mode is that of the one-on-one variety; after each successfully completed round the girl removes a part of her clothing.

The computer versions of the game contain scenes with nudity; among the console versions, the PC-FX one is the only one that similarly lacks censorship. Some of the versions have secondary gameplay modes, such as a team mode in which the player controls three girls and plays mahjong against three others.</resource>

    <resource id="b0059c0505611a0a2783617fd4741de9e431a274" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">In 21st century, Tokyo was suddenly attacked by combined forces of robotic and organic alien races. A special giant mecha fighter craft was constructed in order to avert the threat. A young pilot is sent on the most dangerous mission of his life.

Kiaidan 00 is a horizontally scrolling sci-fi shoot-em-up. The basic gameplay is similar to other games of this genre; however, the weapon system differs from the traditional power-up and upgrade style. The player character has all the weapons at his disposal from the very beginning. The five weapons include spreading energy blasts, focused multiple shot, laser beams that travel in different directions, an energy ball that protects the ship from frontal assaults, and an extended arm that hits enemies melee-style. The player can cycle through and choose any of these weapons at any time. 

Instead of the traditional secondary weapon system the game offers charged modes for all the weapons. When a weapon is charged it either becomes more powerful or gains new properties (for example, the extended arm becomes longer and is controlled from a distance). The player character's health is represented by shield units, which can also be picked up in the stages. Dialogue and cutscenes advance the story between and within missions.</resource>

    <resource id="62fa85305651ad40dd5772a882e088aab651f5af" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">The game is based on the anime Gulliver Boy, created by Teruhisa Hiroi. Gulliver is a young boy who studies magic in a school in a small town in Italy, but is bored with the studies and craves adventure. After he gets his magical diploma, he goes to Venice to hook up with his best friends - the girl Misty, who has healing powers, and the genius inventor Edison. Together, they must stop the plot of the Spanish crown to dominate the world.

K?s? Kagaku Sekai Gulliver Boy differs greatly from the Super Famicom interpretation of the anime. Unlike that action role-playing game, it is a traditional Japanese-style turn-based RPG. It utilizes traditional battle system with a four-heroes party, physical attacks and magic, etc. Stand-out features include a money system that is based on trading rather than obtaining gold from defeated foes, and the fact that the enemies are visible on the field and the combat initiates once Gulliver comes into contact with them, rather than appearing randomly.

Much of the exploration in the game is done by navigating a ship across the Mediterranean sea. Though story progression is linear, several areas of the game's fairly vast world can be explored in a non-linear fashion. The setting is loosely based on real world locations, with deliberately stereotypical, comical and anachronistic elements, involving science fiction and supernatural themes. The game features full-motion anime-style movies (instead of comic-book-like cutscenes typical for PC Engine CD games) and voice acting.</resource>

    <resource id="4152f497419eb52459fc5412ff1cab4d6b294217" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">This version of Fray in Magical Adventure differs from the  original MSX and subsequent computer releases in several ways. It retains the major events of the story and gameplay mechanics; even though it has more detailed graphics, it still looks too similarly to the original release to be qualified as a remake. The major difference is in the layout of locations and enemies. Some levels are entirely different, even when they are composed of the same elements. For example, the introductory level of the original version is skipped; the subsequent level has a different layout and new enemies. There are more treasure chests in this version's levels, more items, and more areas that require jumping. 

This version also has different cut-scenes (for example, the introduction describes some of the events during Fray's study years, which were absent in the original version). The conversations with other characters are longer; certain events are triggered in a different way (such as the necessity to first talk to the guard to trigger the conversation with the mayor in the first town). There is voice acting during important cut-scenes.</resource>

    <resource id="2c1f55ac6ef1e4f32e3827fbc3e74445323bb9b8" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">This interpretation of the famous giant monster from the Japanese cinematic industry takes form of a fighting game, only instead of the usual brave martial artists the players control horrifying monsters from the traditional  Toho lineage: the titular beast itself, Rodan, Anguirus, Ghidorah, and others. The game has two modes: Normal and Vs. The latter is essentially a two-player mode, which allows the players to engage in giant monster battles in a variety of scenarios. Most of the monsters, however, are locked in the Vs. mode before the player has completed the Normal mode.

The Normal mode puts the player in control of Godzilla, who has to go through five stages before reaching the final boss. Each stage has two battles against two different creatures in two different locations, from which the player has to complete only one in order to proceed to the next stage. Depending on the player's performance, points are awarded; in order to be able to compete against different final bosses, the player has to accumulate more points. If the player only has the minimum required points, only one final boss will be available.

The combat system is similar to other fighting games, with various combinations of buttons executing different moves. Naturally, the normal &amp;quot;punch-kick&amp;quot; scheme is modified to suit the monsters' shapes and biological peculiarities. For example, monsters with tails can use tail spin attacks; fire-breathing monsters have a range fire attack, etc. Most of the monsters (including Godzilla) have a move when they hold the opponent and suck its blood. </resource>

    <resource id="6c801729ec41b1898c909ebc23bd723cbd7ee510" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Feed Sluster is a fiend hunter: a man who takes job that involves elimination of mysterious beings known as fiends. One day he is contacted by a woman named Beth, who offers him a more demanding job, which involves investigating shady activities between humans and fiends, and getting to the bottom of the entire mystery, discovering the origin of the fiends and determine their ultimate fate.

Fiend Hunter is a cinematic platformer set in an Old West-like environment with supernatural elements. With the exception of the initial town and a few other locations, the game is spent in areas that require carefully navigating Feed through a series of platform-like structures. Controls and animation resemble those of Prince of Persia. Feed can jump, run, perform a running jump, hang on ledges, pull up or drop down, kneel and crawl. He also takes falling damage; the primary challenge during platforming sequences consists of preventing him from falling down.

Enemies only appear at pre-set points; each battle is one-on-one, and it is impossible to escape from a fight. Coupled with the enemies' high HP count and varied attack patterns, this essentially turns each encounter into a boss battle. Feed fights with a sword and can perform various moves, combining attacks with jumping and ducking. He can also gain access to a few magic spells.

A little fire fiend named Exy accompanies Feed on his journey. Exy can be used as offensive and defensive enhancement in combat, and can also be set to light dark areas. Each enemy drops a special orb that can be used to increase Feed's vitality, attack power, or magic, as well as teach Exy more powerful attacks, which gives the game a light RPG flavor. Feed can also equip rings and buy or find health-restoring and protective potions.</resource>

The game offers awesome full screen animations. The game starts as the two main characters (Buaisu and Gaimu ?) rescue a beautiful girl (Erena) being chased by dark and evil knights. She joins them and tells the story of an evil man and his army of knights. As any traditional strategy game, fights are round based and always start with a scrollable top view of the battle field. During each round, you can either move your characters or engage a close combat if you are close enough to your enemy. The view then zooms in and displays your opponents and yourself, and enclose any characters near to this area. The game is really varied and the Japanese language is only a limitation if you want to know more about the storyline.</resource>

Vaice is on the way to his home country Distoria when he witnesses a group of bandits desecrating a temple. Shortly thereafter he encounters a young woman named Tifire, who describes herself as a fellow Guardian. Vaice and his friends soon draw the ire of a might empire and have to fight for their lives and the destiny of what they hold dear.

The gameplay is similar to that of the previous game, consisting of turn-based battles between Vaice's party and various enemy organizations. Role-playing elements have been enhanced, featuring an experience points system that makes character growth available. Like in the first game, contact with an enemy initiates a separate battle. These battles are more tactical in this installment, taking place on an isometric screen and allowing character movement.

Nobunaga's Ambition is a turn-based strategy game which can be played in different modes.  Players begin by selecting either a 17 regions scenario or a larger 50 scenario. Then, the player must select a daimyo, each of which is rated attributes in several categories; Age, Health, Ambition, Luck, Charm and IQ. As the game progresses, these values change depending on events in the game. The age value represents a time limit of sorts, as an elderly daimyo becomes increasingly likely to die of old age or sickness.</resource>

There is no scenario selection, and the exact timeline is not specified, though the initial situation corresponds to the phase of the war when Liu Bei and Cao Cao were the principal opposing forces. Players can choose to control any of the six most renowned warlords of the time, Liu Bei being the &amp;quot;default&amp;quot; player character with his own extended introduction and personal motives reminiscent of Luo Guanzhong's novelization of the historical events.

Each warlord tries to gain dominance by building up diplomatic relationships and invading other provinces. It is possible to send offerings and diplomatic missions to other rulers, as well as manage army commanders, finances, and provision. Invasions take place on a tactical hexagonal grid, on which the player positions his forces and navigates them in turn-based fashion. When opponents meet on adjacent fields an automatic battle sequence ensues.</resource>

    <resource id="18b9e36c3ade4bb11d437d1904e6ae140eb809d0" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Tenka wa Ware ni is based on the Sangokushi manga by Mitsuteru Yokoyama, itself an adaptation of Eiji Yoshikawa's re-telling of the classic Chinese novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms by Luo Guanzhong. As such, the game includes plot elements and a few characters added by Yoshikawa or Yokoyama, but for the most part remains faithful to the general storyline of the Chinese novel and hence to the actual historical events of the Three Kingdoms Era.

The gameplay is similar to that of Koei's Romance of the Three Kingdoms series, focusing on grand strategy and country management as well as on tactical battles. There is no scenario selection, but the player can choose between multiple warlords of the three kingdoms. The player then manages the province under control of the selected warlord. It is necessary to take care of the population and army, buying provisions, training officers, and publishing edicts. Diplomacy plays an important role: pacts and agreements can be made, and it is also possible to acquire new allies through various means.

Invading (or being attacked by) another country leads to a large-scale tactical battle that takes place on hexagonal grids. The player navigates army divisions in turn-based fashion. Contact with an enemy division leads to yet another sub-mode, where the player controls units that form the division, positioning and navigating them on a smaller battle screen. The game also has a separate battle mode accessible from the main menu, where the player can recreate historical battles directly without going through grand strategy portions.</resource>

    <resource id="f85a65a2ee22cbf6df371102dc018b24b328704d" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Sanjiyan Henj? is based on the manga and anime series 3x3 Eyes. Pai, a young girl from the immortal tribe of sanzhiyan, three-eyed demons of Chinese origin, wants to become a human again. She meets a Japanese teenager named Yakumo Fujii, whom she accidentally turns into a &amp;quot;wu&amp;quot;, an immortal obedient servant of a three-eyed demon. Together, Pai and Yakumo try to regain their lost humanity.

This game can be considered a side-story to the series. The player does not control Yakumo, but an ordinary high-school student named Kenichi Yamamoto. Accidentally, Kenichi comes into contact with the world of demons, and now he needs the help of Pai and Yakumo to be freed. 

The gameplay is standard Japanese-style adventure. The player interacts with the game world by selecting menu commands &amp;quot;Look&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Talk&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;Move&amp;quot;. The game features animated cutscenes and (in its console incarnation) voice-overs.</resource>

The protagonist is Ataru Moroboshi, a high school student who accidentally evokes love in the heart of Lum, the princess of an alien demon-like race. The game does not recount the initial events of the manga and instead is built like an episode, assuming the player's familiarity with the general story and characters. Ataru's ex-girlfriend Shinobu disappears under mysterious circumstances. Ataru and Lum must explore the high school building and find out what happened to Shinobu.

The gameplay is that of a traditional Japanese-style adventure, where all interaction (including navigation) is performed by selecting verb commands from a menu and combining them with objects from a list. game progression is fairly linear, and it is typically required to complete an objective in one location in order to be able to proceed to the next one. There are no real puzzles, but an inventory with items that can be examined is present.</resource>

A barbarian named Lykos has the power to transform into different creatures. He needs to rescue the wizards and the Ring of Five from the Dark Ones before they invade his home, Krellion.

Shape Shifter is a side-scrolling action game with platforming and light role-playing elements. Much of the game consists of traversing hostile areas, fighting regular enemies on the way and defeating bosses. The game's &amp;quot;hub&amp;quot; area is a town where Lykos can replenish his health and buy any of the three available weapons (axe, mace, or bow). These weapons can be upgraded by enchanting them or picking up power-ups.

After Lykos rescues a wizard he gains access to a transformation power. Transformations require special gems and cannot be performed if Lykos runs out of them. There are four transformations in the game: the panther can jump over large gaps; the shark can swim; the golem can jump higher; and the golden dragon can fly. Each of these forms can also collect power-ups that unlocks a few other attack abilities.

The game's stages are interconnected, but usually a new form must be acquired before Lykos can access a new area. Lykos has eight lives consisting of smaller health units (hearts). The game can only be saved in the town.</resource>

There are ten characters to choose from, each representing his or her own country. The main protagonist is a Japanese martial artist named Jin; others include his countryman Zen, a kabuki fighter; a Chinese kung-fu expert and a vampire from Hong-Kong; an Egyptian princess; a scimitar fighter from Saudi Arabia; a spear-wielding Kenyan warrior; a French weapons specialist; and two North Americans - an eyepatched soldier and a blonde female ninja-like fighter. 

There are three modes in the game: a tournament mode, in which these characters compete against each other before facing the final boss; a versus mode; and a group fighting mode, in which each player selects several fighters to represent in a series of one-on-one battles. The fighting scheme resembles that of Yie Ar Kung Fu, though with a simplified handling of high, medium, and low attacks. Some of the characters use weapons in battles; it is possible to knock these weapons out of their hands and use them against their owners.</resource>

F?un Roku, is the fourth game in the Nobunaga series (but only the third one to have been localized in English). The story of Nobunaga takes place during the Japanese civil war of the 16th century. In a wartime strategy game, 15 different warlords are represented across several territories.

One to eight human players can play, controlling different leaders and factions. Gameplay is done in one of two scenarios; the beginning of the civil war in 1555 or Nobunaga surrounded by his enemies in 1571. Management of population, supplies and military are the gameplay and successful manipulation of these numbers in the right combination to attack and defend against hostile intentions is what will bring your forces to victory.</resource>

The story and most of the dialogues remain the same as in the original release; gameplay-wise, the versions are also nearly identical, utilizing the same menu-based verb-object commands. The differences lie mostly in visual presentation and technical quality of the music. The graphics are by far more technically advanced; most locations have been re-drawn from scratch. Digitized photos are used to represent some of the characters, and anime-like style is less pronounced. Many locations and scenes have been expanded, with additional close-ups, different angles, etc. A few locations have been added or made accessible at different moments during the course of the game.</resource>

The woman has a strange request that makes Furuyagi doubt her sanity. For generations, a beautiful doll has been in the possession of her family; however, recently it has disappeared, and the woman is convinced the culprit is the devil himself. Furuyagi travels to the countryside where he begins to investigate this unusual mystery, determined to find out the truth.

Orgel plays similarly to previous installment in the Psychic Detective series. The bulk of the game is occupied by conversations with characters, which often involve talking about various topics, gathering information. There are no puzzles, but pieces of evidence can be collected, stored, and viewed as inventory items. The interaction with the game world is menu-based.</resource>

The levels are split into two stages, the first being a platform stage, the second a shoot 'em up stage which ends in a boss. During the game your energy counts down, so you must keep picking up fruit to replenish yourself. There are a variety of weapons to collect - lasers, spread shots, spinning shields and so on, but these are also on a timer and do not last long, so weapon switching is frequent to avoid being left with your basic short range sword shot. The game is single or two player simultaneous.</resource>

Each stage consists of a rotatable 3D screen containing a number of poles of the same height. Players take turns in placing balls onto these poles. Adjacent balls (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) can be &amp;quot;captured&amp;quot; and hence change their color. Points are awarded per ball of each color. The round ends when there is no more place on the poles to put balls onto, and the player with the most points wins.

The story mode begins with an introduction depicting a powerful demon that can only be vanquished by traveling to the Color World; a young pilot ventures there and must defeat opponents in the Color Wars game at each stage. This mode puts one player against three AI-controlled opponents; the free mode also allows four human players to compete against each other. Two-player mode can be played by either two human players or one player against computer AI.</resource>

The game consists of non-interactive comic book-style scenes with voice-overs, as well as short, very simple adventure-like segments. During these segments the player has five icons at his disposal, each corresponding to a context-specific action. Only one of these actions can solve the problem at hand, but others trigger humorous animations and allow the player to proceed even if the result was fatal</resource>

To start, someone finally fixed the mechanics of the board, so now it really works and is easily controlled. As before, there is a temperature bar, so if it turns red it must cool down before running again, but now it is much easier to regulate the duration of your run without resorting to a turbo button. The level structure and the attack patterns of the enemy are also much more balanced to take into account the use of the board: you are no longer forced to throw yourself headlong into a phalanx of enemies because something is chasing your tail.

Recently, a powerful demon took control of the land, and some humans began using the art of baseball for evil purposes. The malevolent Dark Baseballer has been terrorizing innocents, and it is up to a group of young people to restore justice.

Nekketsu Legend Baseballer is a role-playing game dedicated to baseball. There is no actual baseball simulation in the game: much of it plays like a traditional Japanese RPG, with top-down overworld, town and dungeon explorations, party management, leveling up, equipment, items, etc. However, all the usual RPG paraphernalia is completely baseball-themed. Random turn-based battles occur less frequently than in other comparable games, but last a considerable amount of time due to their mechanics: each party member is in control of a group of &amp;quot;baseball robots&amp;quot;, and defensive and offensive actions are named after real baseball moves.</resource>

    <resource id="6cea07f5edc309949373edb4f90bfa37a7fa0c85" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Ankoku Bujutsukai is based on the manga Y? Y? Hakusho, which tells the story of a young delinquent named Yusuke Urameshi who dies and becomes reincarnated as a reward for a good deed he committed, further serving as an &amp;quot;underworld detective&amp;quot; and solving demon-related mysteries. This adaptation of the manga follows the &amp;quot;Dark Tournament&amp;quot; story arc, where members of Yusuke's team confront the powerful demon Toguro.

Despite its premise, which is reminiscent of a versus fighting game, Ankoku Bujutsukai is an arcade-style shooter. The player selects one of the five characters (Yusuke, Hiei, Kurama, Kuwabara or Genkai), and is then taken to a series of one-on-one shoot-outs in a pre-determined order. The enemy is viewed from a first-person perspective, and the player moves a cursor to aim and shoot. The gameplay system is fairly simple, allowing the player to execute three types of attacks: regular shots, charged shots, and special attacks of limited quantity. Points are received for winning fights and can be used to raise the characters' hit points, speed, or number of special moves.</resource>

The player controls a fighter pilot who defends an unnamed futuristic Empire from an assault of mechanical creatures. In spite of the game's exclusively Japanese release, the protagonist delivers voiced monologues in English, musing over his mission, at the beginning of each stage.

The game has a traditional power-up system with a basic weapon power-up that changes its color rapidly when revealed (red for vulcan gun, green for lasers, blue for missiles), as well as assorted collectible letters that either enhance the strength of the gun with additional shots, add a secondary weapon (such as bombs), or provide the ship with a protective shield. In addition, a powerful all-screen attack can be executed by pressing the second action button. At several points during the game the player is able to choose the next stage among two available ones.

    <resource id="c84eccb83bea14d118fedc0f4b0d192a41f45541" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Once there was a prosperous kingdom, which was protected by a tower, where a mighty dragon was living. The people of the kingdom were secure with such a guardian. But one man wanted the dragon's power for something else, and this man was the king. He went to the tower and tried to kill the dragon, in order to rob his power. But the dragon's fury turned the king into a horrible creature, a demon, and his evil essence made his entire kingdom sink deep under the earth. 

Many years have passed, and now you take control of a traveler named Varik (Ares in the Japanese version). A young woman accuses him of killing her teacher, and in a desperate fight they both fall underground, to where the lost kingdom was buried. You must guide Varik through underground mazes and help him to escape the wrath of his adversary and the demonic inhabitants of the lost kingdom.

The game is an action RPG, a dungeon crawler with plenty of creatures to defeat and many weapons, armor, and other treasure to collect. You can also use magic spells. The camera rotates automatically according to your movements. You also have the ability to jump forwards.</resource>

The group consists of highly trained agents and specializes in performing classified missions for various countries. Sho's first mission is to infiltrate a base in East Africa at the request of the African Federation.

The game is composed out of large-scaled tactical battles. The player navigates the combatants over the screen and tries to accomplish missions without having the main hero killed. Most of the attacks in the game are ranged, and each weapon has unique properties. It is possible to choose full or spreading attacks with many firearms, throw bombs and use special abilities. Weapons have limited ammunition, and must be equipped manually before using. Powerful area attacks can be executed, but they damage everyone in the area, including player-controlled characters. Robot-like machines can be controlled directly by the player or set on auto mode.</resource>

Winning these games unlocks new locations and allows purchase of items that can be used during the encounters to the player's advantage.

The player controls a manager rather than a coach in this installment, and must keep an eye on the finances as a result. Also, instead of training all the five girls from the first game, the player's answers to the questions posed by the assistant in the beginning of the game determine the choice of the trainee among the same five characters.

The player must make schedules for the fighter, which include various training and recreational activities. The manager can hire coaches with their own programs, or input activities individually. The battles themselves allow little input, with the player being able to choose between various types of attacks by selecting them from a menu; the outcome of the battle largely depends on training and individual statistics. </resource>

The game is set in a medieval fantasy land populated by various races; when the country is overrun by demonic invaders, the king cowardly avoids responsibility and puts the task of liberating it into the hands of a group of heroes. Four players (human or AI-controlled) select their characters, each representing an exotic race, and take them on a quest to free the land.

Navigation is done in a board game style; each of the players rolls dice, which determines the amount of moves the character can make. Characters belong to different classes and have unique attributes, abilities, hit and magic points, etc. In towns the characters can rest, purchase magic spells of various levels and elemental disciplines, buy items, and hire companions in bars. These companions also come in many varieties (magic users, monks, barbarians, etc.), and it is necessary to create a balanced party with spellcasters, healers and physically tough characters to prevail.

Fields the characters land on may lead to random events such as stats and money increase, as well as battles. The latter are handled in traditional Japanese-style, turn-based RPG fashion, viewed from a Final Fantasy-like perspective. The player inputs commands (attack, magic, item, etc.) until the enemies are defeated, at which point battle spoils are acquired. Towns are often overrun by tougher enemies and can be liberated by vanquishing them. Should two player-controlled parties meet each other on the same field, they can opt to fight each other.</resource>

The main difference between this entry and the previous ones lies in the quest mode and its RPG elements.

Like a full-fledged role-playing game, the quest mode has leveling up, free top-down navigation, overworld, towns, dungeons, monetary system, weapons, armor, items, and even companions who join the main heroine, a girl named Konoha, who was raised by an old fighter and has to use her special abilities to rid the land of monsters. Battles occur randomly; the player has the choice to try to escape before the battle begins. Each enemy asks a row of trivia questions; correct answers damage the enemy and eventually defeat him, while wrong answers deplete the HP of the controllable characters. Levels, weapons, armor and items contribute to the damage equation, raising or lowering the amount of questions needed to answer correctly in order to prevail.</resource>

The basic plot follows the events that began in the first installment, but it is told in an entirely different fashion, with different scenes, dialogues, etc. For example, the game begins a short while before the starting point of the first chapter, and contains conversations between the protagonist Miyu Izawa and the murder victim Marie, which were not present in the original story. The visual style of the game is also quite different, with bright anime-like graphics atypical of the previous entries. 

Gameplay-wise, this installment also differs from the preceding computer games by greatly reducing interaction. All of the dialogue in the game is spoken, and much of the narration is revealed through Miyu's thoughts which act like cutscenes, rather than being derived from interaction with the environment. In essence, the game is a fairly linear visual novel with some occasions where the player is able to visit different locations.</resource>

He meets Althea, a girl from a village whose inhabitants were massacred by orcs. The two travel to the castle, where they meet the king of Satania, and learn of an ancient powerful artifact that has now caused the resurrection of a powerful demon. Ax reveals his own demonic heritage, but is willing to join forces with the people of the kingdom and fight against his kin...

Completely unrelated to an  earlier game of the same name, Sword Master is a tactical RPG, i.e. a hybrid of Japanese-style RPG and strategic battles. The player controls a  small party at first, but later can command several units. Most of the gameplay takes place on the battle fields. The player navigates the heroes in turn-based fashion, attacking or casting magic when the enemy is in range. Attacks are presented as short full-screen animated sequences. Characters gain experience after each attack and might level up in the middle of the battle.

Unlike many other games of this kind, Sword Master contains an additional RPG element in the possibility to navigate the characters in real time in towns and other &amp;quot;friendly&amp;quot; areas. The story progression, however, is completely linear, and the player can not explore hostile areas.

What remains is the classic mode that allows the player to choose the type of arcade cabinet (upright, black &amp; white, etc.) as background to the action as well as the versus mode for two players. The versus mode is split-screen, each player trying to survive and eliminate more invaders than the opponent.

The Game Boy version has both one- and two-player modes using the usual Game Boy tones (black and grey). However, plugging the cart into a Super Game Boy allows playing the game in all four cabinet types of the SNES version. 

The PC Engine (TurboGrafx) CD version offers an additional &amp;quot;cosmic versus&amp;quot; mode, where the background is composed of anime-style pictures of girls. They also appear in the &amp;quot;omake mode&amp;quot;, which is a single-player variant with the same backgrounds.

The WonderSwan version doesn't offer all four cabinet types (only black &amp; white) but keeps the versus mode.</resource>

The anime focuses on Yohko Mano, a Japanese high school student who discovers that she is the 108th Devil Hunter, destined to fight supernatural evil beings in accordance with her legacy. The game puts the player in the role of Shoma, a new exchange student who meets Yohko and her best friend Chikako at his new school. Miraculously, the three are teleported into a parallel dimension, and the reluctant hero discovers, to his amazement, that its inhabitants seem to be familiar with him.

The game plays like a typical Japanese-style adventure, with a menu of verb commands (Look, Talk, Think, and Move) at nearly every screen, some leading to object lists. It is often necessary to go through the commands several times to unlock a new one or trigger events. Limited menu-based navigation is also present. </resource>

As opposed to the previous game, where Shoma was the protagonist, Yohko is the player character in the sequel.

Gameplay-wise, the puzzle-less Japanese adventure format is further utilized. Verb commands must be selected from a menu and sometimes combined with objects or character names for interaction. It is often necessary to repeat commands several times to trigger the next event. </resource>

Sangokushi is a somewhat light-hearted depiction of the famous  Three Kingdoms historical period in China. In its core, it is a turn-based strategy game, similar to the more popular  Romance of the Three Kingdoms series. The player has the choice of playing through 8 different scenarios, starting with Dong Zhuo's rise to power in the late 2nd century, and ending with the last struggle of Cao Cao's sons and the destruction of the three kingdoms. The player can also construct his/her own map, and play it controlling any of the available Three Kingdoms characters from any scenario.

The player selects a warlord and his capital city, from which he manages his wars. Compared to Romance of the Three Kingdoms, the game is quite simple, with the battles being automatic and the player having by far less strategic options, focusing mostly on comparing statistics and building a line of generals powerful enough to attack the nearest city. Unlike most other historical games, the game has a comical, &amp;quot;super-deformed&amp;quot; graphical style, with famous Chinese warlords presented as typically Japanese big-eyed anime portraits.</resource>

In this game in the Fire Pro Series, the cast of the All Japan Women's Pro-Wrestling promotion are available, all fighting to win the Red belt, the highest prize of the federation. It's also possible to fight in single matches, tournaments, Battle Royal and Elimination matches. The usual array of options in CAW is present, being possible to create 16 new Wrestlers.

Gameplay, as usual is the series, is dramatically different than in most western games. Each wrestler has a bunch of moves, ranked from weak to strong. While it's possible to connect any of them from open situations, while grappling only when the opponent is already beaten the most powerful moves can be successfully used. </resource>

Hundreds of years ago, light-speed travel was invented, allowing the inhabitants of different star systems to navigate spaceships and establish contact with each other. Three hundred years ago, a great leader named Dumna founded a centralized kingdom where the different races populating the universe could leave in peace. However, after his death political tensions have increased, eventually resulting in the dissolution of the kingdom and the partition of Wisperad into three spheres of influence: the Mars Confederation, the Kingdom of Willia, and the Empire of Zolius.

A young man named Sion Asmarn lives in the town of Cosma on the planet Homu together with his father, a famous explorer. One day, a huge meteorite falls on the planet. Sion's father goes to investigate it together with the physicist Mamon Penrose. Sion and his girlfriend Shoko, Mamon's daughter, venture into the canyon where the meteorite has fallen, only to witness Mamon, apparently possessed by a mysterious force, killing Sion's father and escaping. Determined to get to the bottom of this terrible affair, the two embark on a journey that takes them to different corners of the universe.

Alshark is a Japanese-style sci-fi role-playing game with several distinguishing features. The player controls a party of up to five characters, exploring a vast world consisting of several solar systems, each with its own planets and space stations, many of which can be accessed in any order. Navigation in space is done with the help of the space ship Atlia, which can be equipped with various weapons, engines and frames. From time to time the player will engage in random space combat against enemy ships, earning scrap that can be converted into money. These dogfights are automatic by default, but the player can choose to control the ship and fire its weapons manually, in an arcade shooter style.

The bulk of the exploration, however, takes place on planet surfaces, which the party can explore on foot or in vehicles such as buggies, tanks or hovercrafts. Enemies appear randomly; combat is turn-based and is viewed from the same overhead perspective as the exploration. Only Sion is directly controlled by the player, while other characters follow AI routines, using normal attacks as well as offensive and healing techniques. Characters can equip head and body armor, futuristic melee weapons, as well as a variety of firearms. A &amp;quot;party talk&amp;quot; feature is available, with the characters being able to consult each other at any time. The game is also notable for allowing the characters to level up beyond the customary cap of 100.

The Sega CD version has new anime-style cutscenes and audio music tracks. The PC Engine (TurboGrafx) CD version has a re-worked interface with full-screen navigation, as well as additional cutscenes and voice-overs. It also greatly reduces the amount of random enemy encounters during on-foot exploration, and generally lowers the difficulty level of the game.</resource>

A wealthy school principal has placed a challenge for all the school gangs to compete in a special obstacle course composed of 4 different challenges that you and your team must overcome. First in line is a race across the city streets (and rooftops), next is an obstacle course filled with dangerous hazards, then a jumping challenge in which you have to break a series of metal balls, and finally an all-out fighting tournament.

The game uses the same engine and basic gameplay mechanics featured in other Nekketsu High games, with the only change being the goals you must complete to clear each stage. Seeing as how the characters are gang members, fighting and beating your opponents can be a viable way of winning the challenges, so several weapons and power-ups can also be found in the courses </resource>

    <resource id="4b511071c91bff1c6a2ce62ef722f4ea280f15dd" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">As earthquakes occurred in the kingdom of Itchy, and demons began roaming freely through the wilderness, the king realized that an ancient prophecy is about to be fulfilled, and the entire world is in danger. The valiant swordsman Soleil lives in the capital city, and the king entrusts him with the task of protecting the two Moon goddesses, and retrieving the Sun Sword, which are necessarily to prevent a magician known as Silver to use the Gears of Fate for his evil purposes...

Sol Moonarge is a traditional Japanese-style RPG. As in most games of this genre, the player navigates the main hero and his companions on the top-down &amp;quot;world map&amp;quot;, entering towns to buy weapons, armor, and items, as well as hostile locations which are necessary to complete to advance the plot in a linear fashion. Enemy encounters are random; combat is turn-based and viewed from first-person perspective.

As in most Japanese RPGs, the characters level up automatically, after having accumulated a set amount of experience points; specific weapon and magic proficiencies, however, grow depending on the amount of times player-controlled characters use that particular type of weapon or spell.

There is a day-night cycle (on the world map only), which influences people's schedules: at night the shops are closed, but certain characters might appear only during that time.</resource>

The regular mode introduces familiar regular enemies and a few new bosses. The &amp;quot;Carnival Mode&amp;quot; contains Score Attack and Time Attack modes, both requiring the player to focus on attaining the high score rather than just surviving. For that reason the difficulty in these modes is more forgiving; they allow more continues and have more generously placed power-ups. These modes also offer more destructible objects on the screen, as these specifically serve to increase the score.</resource>

There are three cases in the game, all accessible from the main menu: two murders (the victims being young women), and one case of missing money. Up to four human- or AI-controlled characters are trying to solve these mysteries.

Players navigate the characters in a turn-based fashion on a board representing an urban environment. The amount of steps taken by each character is determined by a dice roll, but the board consists of many branching paths, and it's up to the players to choose the desired ones. Characters can question suspects, gather clues and collect information when they land on appropriate squares on the board. Special squares procure cards, which can be used for various purposes, e.g. examine a piece of evidence, take a taxi to another place in the city, etc.</resource>

There is no background story in the game and no cutscenes; the player pilots a fighter plane, flying over various areas such as a desert, a sea, a city at night, etc. Most of the enemies are different types of aircraft, though a few stationary turrets appear as well. 

The player-controlled fighter can pick up power-ups that change his primary weapon: red for a vulcan gun, yellow for energy bolts, and blue for laser. Each of these will increase in power (e.g. three lasers instead of one for the blue weapon) when the player repeatedly collects power-ups of the same color. Other power-ups add a secondary weapon or enhancement to any of the described above, such as homing missiles, fireballs, a wingman, etc. Secondary weapons are fired simultaneously with the main ones. In addition, special weapons can be collected and accumulated. These weapons are triggered by pressing a separate button, and include delayed bombs, exploding bullets, protective shields, and others.</resource>

Humanity has built a new civilization, which resembles a medieval world. The young swordsman Jan lives In the kingdom of Cordelia. One fine day he and Ortena, the daughter of the High Priest, go on a treasure hunt. When they return, they find the country overrun by monsters; Ortena's father is killed, and the princess of Cordelia has been kidnapped. The two team up with a legendary hero, in order to rescue those who can still be rescued, and fulfill the legacy of the gods...

Ruin: Kami no Isan is an action RPG. The player navigates Jan through top-down towns and hostile areas; the &amp;quot;world map&amp;quot; is not free-roaming, allowing only linear advancement from location to location. Hostile areas are populated by enemies who are visibly walking on screen. 

Unlike most Japanese RPGs, there are no separate &amp;quot;battle screens&amp;quot; in the game; the monsters are fought on the same spot they are encountered on, like in action games. However, unlike most action RPGs, there is a party in Ruin. The player controls only Jan, while the other party members act according to AI routines: attacking, casting offensive and healing spells, etc. 

The rest of the gameplay is traditional Japanese RPG style: acquiring better weapons and armor, automatic leveling up, linear story development, etc.</resource>

You and a friend explore the labyrinthine planet of slime, armed with a water pistol and all manner of gadgets you find along the way in an effort to find your way back out.  The game world is a giant maze with quirky hidden areas and plenty of original layout ideas.  Depending on the game mode, you are either cooperating or competing with your &amp;quot;friend&amp;quot; to find and get to an exit first.  Due to the massive sizes of the slime worlds (about 6 entries to choose from), games often take several hours to complete.

The basis of the game is exploration, with varying game modes further focusing on competition, puzzle solving, speed, exploration, or cooperation.</resource>

The game has three modes: exhibition, team management, and new player debut. Exhibition mode allows the player to select from a wide variety of wrestlers and compete in single, double, or tag-team (six wrestlers) fashions. New player debut puts the player in the role of popular wrestlers from the franchise, taking them through training sessions and a series of matches.

Team management is the game's most expansive mode. In this mode, the player assumes the role of a manager who has to assemble a team of wrestlers to compete in Japanese regional leagues. New wrestlers can be picked from known athletes, or &amp;quot;scouted&amp;quot; on the street, with varied effects. The player then assigns schedules and activities for the wrestlers. It is possible to talk to them, send them on vacations, and also fire them. The player can also renovate the gym, design masks for the wrestlers, handle public relations, and perform other management duties. All these activities cost action points and have to be handled with care before the team is challenged for competition.</resource>

Gameplay mechanics, however, are different: players can only control regular-looking cars, which are presented as small sprites. Each car is equipped with two types of firearms, which can be used against opponents to win the race. Every course only occupies one screen, and the player has to complete laps faster than AI-controlled cars or race against time. Multiplayer (for two or four players) is also available. 

Time attack mode allows the player to select any course from twenty-five available ones, thematically grouped in five categories: Circuit (resembling racing tracks), City (urban locations), Nature (field, beach, desert, etc.), Märchen (colorful fairy tale-like courses), and Special (unorthodox designs, e.g. a giant ape overlooking a road). Courses usually include various hazards that slow down or trap cars, as well as turbo fields that speed them up. Some courses also have entrances and exits, which teleport cars to another location on the screen.</resource>

One day, solving a little monster problem in the nearby forest, they encounter a mysterious masked man, who tells Ryeza she wields the power of the sacred jewel Basted. Soon the two girls join forces with a princess in exile, and work together to restore the throne to its rightful owners, persecuted by the ruthless Empire and its allies.

Though Basted may look like an RPG at first sight (medieval setting, top-down world, game progression that alternates between towns and dungeons, etc.), it is in fact primarily an action game. Controlling Ryeza and Anita, the player explores the surroundings, talks to people and participates in battles to advance the story. There are no levels, items, equipment, money system, or other required RPG elements.

Most battles occur as dictated by the plot, though some are optional. The battles take place on a separate screen. For most battles, the player is able to choose either Ryeza or Anita. Ryeza can jump, and Anita has a long-ranged fire attack. Regular attacks can be powered-up if executed when the attack power meter is at maximum. Both girls can also charge power to execute devastating special attacks (two unique attacks per girl). They are also able to dash and attack while dashing, inflicting more damage.

The game features a large amount of fully voiced anime-style cutscenes to advance the story.</resource>

The idyllic life of the Alurean people was shattered when the King is killed by a dragon, and a range of nasties inhabit the lands. Fortunately his twin sons have come to the rescue, and you must take control of one or the other to put the world right.

The boys have differing skills - one is more skilled in sword-fighting (which you are always armed with), the other in magic (available in limited amounts on each level). You collect coins as the game goes on, and spend these in the shop on extra magic, extra lives and enhanced swords.

There are 3 levels on offer - Earth, The Heavens and The Sea, and these can be tackled in any order. The first is straight platform action, the second involves jumping across clouds, and the third sees your characters swim. After those are completed, you must venture into the Monster Castle and finally slay the dragon.</resource>

    <resource id="067dcb7362140aadc0177bf089bfc008f19cfe3d" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Sylphia is set in an environment inspired by the Greek mythology. The heroine of the game was a fearless maiden who tried to protect her home town from the onslaught of monsters. But even her power was no enough, and she was slain... Touched by her sacrifice, the goddess Athena revived her as a flying demi-goddess. Restored to new life, Sylphia can now unleash her wrath upon the monsters and their supporters.

Despite its theme and setting, Sylphia plays like a vertically scrolling shooter. As in most games of this kind, the gameplay consists of shooting down waves of enemies, on the ground and in the skies. Sylphia can use four types of ranged attacks, which roughly correspond to other shooters' traditional weapons: fire blasts, laser, spreading fire, homing missiles. These weapons are displayed as colored orbs and must be collected. Power-ups can be collected for each type of attack. In addition, a devastating special attack can be stored (for one charge) and executed.</resource>

There is no actual story in the game; various characters from F?un Kabuki Den, headed by the charismatic actor/world-savior Kabuki Danjuro himself, fight each other for no apparent reason - even the &amp;quot;scenario mode&amp;quot; allows the player to choose any of the eight available characters, putting him/her against friends and foes alike, one by one.

The characters are a mixture of protagonists, villains, and support characters from F?un Kabuki Den's, including the heroes Kabuki, Okuni, and Zeami, as well as the villains Kikugorou and Garp, and - naturally! - the recurrent stupid ape Mantou. 

Beside the scenario mode, there is also a Vs. mode, which is basically a two-player mode, allowing two players to fight against each other as any of the eight characters; and a so-called &amp;quot;Life Attack&amp;quot; mode, which randomly chooses AI-controlled opponents for a player-selected character.

Kabuki Itt?ry?dan plays like a typical fighting game, the two basic moves being a kick and a punch; other moves are unique for each character and involve strong melee moves or magic-like ranged attacks. For example, Kabuki is able to attack with a sword, while Okuni can set her opponents on fire.</resource>

It doesn't have a developed story; rather, it tells background stories of the ten fighters the player can control in the game: Jenius, Asasin, Arcer (sic to all three), Samohan, Greeze, Orga, Lobo, Blocken, Jyobei and Daibuster. The only time the background story is told is when the player selects a fighter in the story mode. Usually, the five &amp;quot;good&amp;quot; fighters have to face the five &amp;quot;evil&amp;quot; ones one after the other (each in different order) if selected in the story mode. Though the game's intro states that it is less about who is good and who is evil, and more about who is the better fighter...

The gameplay is for the most part traditional fighting game-style (with the obligatory two-player battle mode as an option to the linear story mode); an important difference is the fact that some of the characters use swords and other weapons, rather than fight with their bare hands. The traditional &amp;quot;kick&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;punch&amp;quot; buttons are called &amp;quot;short attack&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;long attack&amp;quot; here; their execution is unique to each fighter.</resource>

The game takes place in the far future, on an alien planet dominated by seven elf-like or catgirl princesses that have fallen under the spell of a unique virus that has driven them mad and threatens to destroy the planet if all the rulers declare all-out war.

Only Blondia Varady (nicknamed &amp;quot;Blow&amp;quot;) and his sister Fallandia have been spared from the disease and must pilot their fighter ships in order to penetrate deep into the domain of each princess, destroy their war machines, and administer the antidote. Fortunately for Blow, the antidote has been synthesized into his reproductive organ, so that means there is only one way to inoculate the girls....

The player controls the fighter ship through vertically scrolling stages, trying to destroy every ship that crosses its path and reach the end boss. The ship has a primary weapon that can be constantly upgraded by collecting power-ups, and a secondary slot for all sorts of collectible weapons that can be picked up in mid-air. The game features 2P-cooperative gameplay and cutscenes made of still images that explain the plot and depict the protagonist's encounters with each princess.</resource>

Beauty matters, but so does skill. As the manager of one of the young girls who wants to participate in the contest, the player has to do everything in his/her power to attain the goal, and help the disciple reach stardom!

Virgin Dream is what is commonly called life simulation, a genre popularized by games such as the  Princess Maker series. The player manages the life of the young girl with a specific goal in mind, which must be chosen from the main menu. The girl can strive to become a singer, a photo model, a school teacher, etc. The player then tries to alter her statistics accordingly to achieve the goal.

The main activities on work days are divided into three groups: training, working, and learning. The learning category is the smallest one, but is also necessary for continuing the girl's normal school life. Training includes singing, arts, body building, sports, etc. Part-time jobs such as waitress, cook, private tutor, and even construction worker are available; the pay varies greatly, but so are the changes in parameters.

On holidays, the girl is able to venture outside and explore the top-down city, which contains various shops, boutiques, offices, etc. Clothes and other accessories can be purchased. It is also possible to talk and bond with other girls, potential rivals, who live in the same dormitory. All this influences the heroine's parameters, for good and for bad. </resource>

    <resource id="0dadb960f1f3c1253dc388869d21429e3bab0bab" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">A mysterious young woman with a baby was attacked during the Holy Night. She managed to escape, but collapsed and died in front of the church in the city of Yalem. But the baby survived, grew up, and eventually became a hero on a quest to avenge his mother's murderers and save the world.

Seiya Monogatari: Anearth Fantasy Stories differs from most other role-playing games in several important aspects. The player creates the main character in a unique way: when the baby lies on the snow outside of the church, several people pass by. The player can choose to press the action button, making the baby cry and attracting the attention of these people. Depending on the timing of  this &amp;quot;baby action&amp;quot;, the hero will be adopted by different people, which make him belong to a different character class (fighter, thief, mage, or monk), and also lead to four entirely different prologues (once the hero turns fifteen, the four stories eventually merge into one).

Instead of random battles - or even regular battles with wandering enemies - the game has pre-set battles, which occur much less frequently than in traditional Japanese RPGs. Winning the battles depends less on leveling-up and more on the actual tactics used during the battle. There are no levels in the game; instead, the characters gain better statistics depending on their actions during battles (e.g., using magic will increase magic power, etc.). The battles are turn-based and are viewed from a side-scrolling perspective. The game focuses on exploration, having large and complex locations as well as plenty of items of different categories that can be found if the player explores the game world properly.</resource>

    <resource id="c664a12ae76e9e1b86a4debaa70ed73a45787ab5" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Based on the Addams Family movie, this game is quite different from the other Addams Family variants. The player is cast in the role of Tully Alford, the crooked lawyer of the Addams family. He finds out that somewhere in the family mansion, a great treasure is stored in a vault. He decides to venture into the mansion and retrieve the treasure. Naturally, this is going to be anything but easy, as the insane Addams family members and a legion of ghosts and monsters are there to make sure the lawyer fails...

Like most other Addams Family incarnations, this is a side-scrolling action game. Tully Alford's only weapon is an umbrella that fires energy shots at enemies. Tully can also jump and duck to avoid enemy blows. The game world consists of a &amp;quot;hub&amp;quot; area, the hall of Addams Family mansion, and many rooms, most of which are locked in the beginning of the game. The gameplay consists mainly of exploring the accessible rooms and collecting keys that are needed to open other doors in the process. Some of the rooms contain treasure and power-ups, while others are infested by monsters or require the player to defeat a boss enemy in order to advance.</resource>

The concept of the game is remotely similar to that of Lemmings: the player's task is to &amp;quot;program&amp;quot; the actions of the hero in order to safely traverse a stage full of traps and hazards. Unlike Lemmings, there is only one primate to control in this game; also, the player's &amp;quot;programming&amp;quot; must be performed before letting the monkey loose, unlike the real-time player input in Lemmings.

The player basically orders the monkey what to do at specific spots (which are highlighted by exclamation marks on the level map). In the beginning the levels are short and simple, and the monkey can perform only one action. As the game advances, the puzzles become more and more complex, and so is the amount of actions the monkey must perform to reach safety.</resource>

    <resource id="75fb23887938ab98ffd9d2f1fe8b67645c983002" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Based on the popular Doraemon franchise, Nobita no Dorabian Night follows the adventures of the titular robotic cat, as he tries to rescue his friends from different time periods. How did this happen? Naturally, because of Nobita, Doraemon's best friend and geek extraordinaire. Something went wrong when Nobita was showing his friends a time machine, so they ended up stranded in hostile worlds, and now it's Doraemon's job to save them!

The game is a traditional platformer; Doraemon's main activities are jumping his way through the levels and eliminating enemies who try to stop him. Doraemon starts with an ordinary gun, but later is able to find other weapons, including a homing bowling ball launcher and a stun gun. He can also collect various power-ups, such as limited invincibility, high speed, an item that freezes all the enemies on the level for a short time, etc. It is possible to switch weapons and power-ups at any time.</resource>

You control Prince Eric, the descendant of the hero of the first game. You return to your home country, only to discover that your father was murdered. You should become the new king, but the minister of the late king has other plans, frames you for killing your own father, and throws you into jail, where your adventure begins.

Unlike the first Shadowgate, this is a platform game - not an action game, but a classical point-and-click adventure viewed from a platform perspective. You can move your hero around, examine, manipulate, and take objects. You can also duck and have a &amp;quot;punch&amp;quot; command. Find the correct solutions to the game's puzzles, otherwise a gruesome death awaits you!</resource>

    <resource id="1a2fd9425a6413600bbe507fb9d387af9f5a7949" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Camp California is the second and last game based on the short-lived multimedia property of the same name, featuring a group of anthropomorphic animals who are the official mascots of surf rock group The Beach Boys.

In the game, the gnarly surfer dudes of the Camp California crew find that their favorite beach has been sold to a villain called the Big Cheese who plans to build a nuclear power plant in the area. The gang's plan: hold a benefit concert to raise enough money to buy back the beach. Unfortunately, the Big Cheese gets wind of the plan and sends his henchmen, the Ratz, to kidnap the crew, steal their instruments and take the tires off Woody, the gang's trusty vehicle. Luckily, Byron the bear was out surfing while this happened, and it now falls to him to rescue his friends and get back the tires and the instruments.

The game is a side-scrolling platformer consisting of nine levels, with such areas as a beach, a junkyard, an amusement park, an army base and a mall. The levels are reached via an overview map of California that players drive along in Woody. To start the car, the tires must be found in the first level. All other levels then contain instruments or members of the crew to rescue. At the start, players can only control Byron, but once a new friend has been rescued, they can be selected to be played at the beginning of a level. All characters differ in abilities. Byron punches and kicks to defeat enemies while Lil' Bro (the star of the previous game) uses his skateboard to skid or jump on top of the bad guys. Shred can turn into a tornado, Pouch headbutts and is also the only one who can swim underwater, and Scream'r uses a boomerang and is the only one who can fly.

Besides many enemies (mostly the Ratz gang, but also robotic dogs and other critters) the levels include recyclables to pick up, like soda cans and banana peels. When a level is completed, the trash is converted into fuel for Woody. If the fuel runs out on the overview map, the car can only be restarted at the loss of a life.

The game features voiced cutscenes and CD-quality background music, including three Beach Boys tracks: Fun, Fun, Fun, I Get Around and Good Vibrations.</resource>

The player plays the part of Dr. Greg Bradley, a geologist and the newest resident in town. Eager to satisfy his scientific mind, Bradley sets out to examine the crash-site of a mysterious meteor, but what he finds is not at all what he had been looking for.</resource>

As a result, they travel from planet to planet in an attempt to find a planet suitable enough to terraform into a new Earth.  Along the way they encounter alien races which they must destroy in an attempt to survive and continue the human race.

The gameplay is a basic side-scrolling shooter, shooting down enemy space ships, picking up power-ups and health icons and upgrading main and secondary weapons along with the obligatory huge stage bosses.  The most notable feature of the game is the work done by Syd Mead, a special effects artist for such films as Star Trek: The Motion Picture, Blade Runner, Aliens, 2010 and as recent as Mission Impossible III.</resource>

For those who don't know what the Summer Carnival is, it is the equivalent of the Hudson Caravan Stage. These contests allowed players from all over Japan to compete and win prizes.
The principle is simple: play during a defined time in order to make the most points possible. In this case, what better than a good old shoot'em up! Alzadick makes full use of the principle of the timed game... So much so that one wonders why it could be marketed... Maybe only to allow players to train for the tournament.</resource>

The galaxy police sends two agents to deal with the threat: Hiro Aoyama and Michiko Akasaka, who can transform into the powerful super-fighters Gayvan and Mittchi, respectively, and are alone able to stop Ballas.

Galaxy Deka Gayvan is a brawler. Players can choose to control either of the two heroes, or both of them in a co-op mode. Like in other beat-em-up games, the player must defeat all the enemies on screen in hand-to-hand combat before being able to proceed. Both Hiro and Michiko can accumulate special energy (dropped by the enemies along with health power-ups and money) that allows them to transfer into the superheroes Gayvan and Mittchi and stay in that form until they run out of energy. The superhero forms are stronger and are able to execute special attacks.

In addition, a two-player versus fighting mode is included. Players can choose either the protagonists or three enemy characters to compete against each other in one-on-one fighting.</resource>

The player adopts the identity of an ancient Chinese warrior, and riding on horseback has to eliminate all his opponents, mostly infantry and archers. 

Four historical characters from the time period can be controlled: Zhang Fei (fights with a halberd), Liu Bei (broadsword), Guan Yu (a Chinese pole weapon known as guan dao), and Zhao Yun (pike); some of the character names are misspelled in translated versions. The characters are distinguished by their health and strength parameters.

The game uses a lateral scroll and the player can move in all four directions. A novelty is the attack system: when pressing fire the energy of the attack will load up as the warrior moves his weapon up and backwards, in order to gain momentum. The more the player can keep fire pressed, the more powerful the attack will be. In addition, so-called &amp;quot;tactics&amp;quot; can be used at specific moments; these are powerful area attacks that deplete the protagonist's HP in process and range from summoning an ambush partner and causing rocks slide down slopes.

Stages typically culminate in boss battles. Along the way, various power-ups can be collected. Besides treasure that increases the player's score, and food packs that heal the protagonist, there are also yellow and blue orbs, which represent the game's light RPG elements: yellow orbs count as experience points and increase the character's vitality after a stage is over, and blue orbs increase the power of his weapon.</resource>

    <resource id="bcae822ca957a5226955c2f25ffb0e0e87bec5ae" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Implode is a homebrew puzzle game. It plays like a falling block puzzle in all respects, with the exception of the fact that the blocks appear from below instead of falling. All the blocks have the same shape and are only distinguished by their color. The player must selects groups of three or more identically colored blocks in order to make them disappear. The goal is to not let the blocks stack up and pass the upper border of the screen. Bombs would sometimes appear and clear out adjacent blocks if the player selects them. The game gradually advances to higher difficulty levels, with more colors and faster speed.

Also included on the CD are two games previously only released in downloadable emulation format: Crash and Humpball. The first is a single-screen overhead arcade racing game. Two cars race automatically on a maze-like screen in circular movement. Players must press directional buttons to switch between the tracks. The goal is to move over all the dots scattered in the stage while avoiding crashing into the other car. 

Humpball can be described as a cross between Pong and a volleyball game. Two hump-like creatures are positioning on either side of a pole, tossing a ball towards the opponent's side by moving to the sides and jumping. The goal is to make the ball touch the opponent's floor, which results in scoring a point. Power-ups that move the pole to left or right, change the speed of the ball, gravity rules, etc., appear randomly and are activated when touched by the ball.</resource>

The player controls a spaceship navigated by an astronaut named Stryker, who is sent on a mission to destroy dangerous asteroids in space. There are four different ships to choose from, each with different power and speed ratings. The player can move the ship and rotate its cannon to shoot asteroids. Big and medium asteroids split in two when shot, and only when they are small they can be fully destroyed. A stage is completed when all the asteroids have been eliminated. All the stages take place on the same screen, but feature different enemies and difficulty level. 

The DX version is a physical release of a previous download-only version, and includes hostile UFOs that shoot at the player-controlled ship, boss battles, CD audio soundtrack, and power-ups that temporarily grant shields and other bonuses.

Also included on the CD is a timed mode (&amp;quot;Caravan Mode&amp;quot;) of Implode, as well as the puzzle game Loop, which was previously only released in emulator-only downloadable format and requires the player to rotate and construct loops out of pipe pieces that gradually fill up the screen, making them disappear.</resource>

With 5 ships at your disposal, we know that the attacking forces can be defeated and repelled. You are our last hope. You can save us. Are you up to the challenge? Hypernova Blast is a reimagining of the classic game Nova Blast (ColecoVision, 1983). You choose one of 5 ships to pilot and must use bombs and lasers to protect your cities from alien invaders. You have a limited amount of energy, which also serves as a shield, and when a city is too low, you must decide whether to save your city or keep more energy for yourself. The game is over when your ship's energy is exhausted or when all your cities have fallen.</resource>

Despite the abundance of pretty girls, there are no explicit sex scenes in this game.

The game consists of a scenario mode (single-player) and a versus mode (up to four players). Both modes offer seven characters to choose from. The characters are comically-themed and include a hyperactive schoolgirl, an armored ninja, and others. There is no real storyline behind these characters; each comes with a short introduction sequence that invariably leads to their admittance to an alien-organized TV show, where they have to defeat enemies and retrieve prizes.

Each stage is an overhead screen containing the protagonist, enemies, the prize, and several bombs. The bombs should be picked up and carried around; they are used to deal with enemies and blow up the receptacle in which the prize is contained. The green bombs change their color to yellow and red when picked up, at which point they are about to explode and have to be thrown to avoid damage. Bombs also blow holes in the terrain, and the player must pay attention not to fall through. In addition to bomb-carrying and bomb-throwing, each character possesses a special ability. These range from throwing projectiles at enemies to speeding up when driving a bike, depending on the selected character.</resource>

In reality Mail is having a hard time making ends meet. One day, however, she learns about a magician who has gone rogue and has a hefty bounty on his head. Her adventure begins as Popful fights her way through a new adventure, and makes new friends along the way.

Popful Mail is a platform action game with very light RPG elements. As the heroine makes her way through the stages she collects money from slain foes. This money can be used in shops to buy weapons, armor, health, and so on. The game features interaction with many characters through both on-screen dialog and fully animated sequences. Some of these characters become playable as the player progresses through the game.

This release has the same story and general gameplay style as the earlier version, but otherwise was made from scratch.</resource>

The brave young ninja Kaze is summoned by Lord Yoshikage and sent on a dangerous mission: infiltrate Hiei's castle, defeat his minions, and rescue Shizuhime.

Kaze Kiri is essentially a beat-em-up with a few distinguishing characteristics. The game consists of traversing fully linear side-scrolling areas, defeating regular enemies and bosses on the way. Before being able to fight the stage boss, Kaze has to vanquish a pre-determined number of enemies, which is displayed as a shared enemy HP on top of the screen.

Kaze attacks with his sword when he is near the enemy, or throws shurikens at them from afar. Enemy projectiles can also be blocked by countering them with shurikens. Kaze can also disappear for a moment and re-appear at another location. He can jump, duck, perform somersaults, and grab and throw enemies. Kaze's health regenerates over time if he is not hit repeatedly. Completing the game unlocks another playable character, the female ninja Suzu.</resource>

The two characters have the same goal: prevent a secret organization of monsters and undead, run by a maniacal vampire, from taking control over Europe. The two characters begin with different initial stages, but continue on the same path afterwards. Seishiro is physically weaker and has a default ranged energy attack; Fujiro fights with regular punches and kicks. Both characters have access to unique elemental attacks that are activated by holding down a button. Most of the stages are straightforward side-scrolling action with boss battles at the end of each; a few areas contain light platforming elements.</resource>

Your goal is easy, shoot all the enemies along the way. You only get a standard gun on your plane, and no bombs. Instead of bombs you can call helper planes. These planes make a formation around you and help to shoot all enemies.

Along the way you get the chance to collect power-ups by shooting transport trucks. When these are destroyed they release a power-up. There are three types. First is the weapon upgrade, with this you get a wider and more powerful shot. Second, you get more calls for helper planes. And third are extra lives.

Nec Avenue certainly acknowledged that the game's best asset was the unique and innovative ability to jack-in and dive into computerized cyber-space worlds. This sequel follows the same formula but also features probably one of most electrifying storyline ever written for a video game. The brain of Adolf Hitler has been digitized inside a computer mainframe by terrorists and Syd, an elite cyber-diver and protagonist of the game, embarks on a perilous journey to stop and destroy the incoming threat. On board his ship and helped by the cute Deva, Syd flies through nine enemy infested areas and dives into abstract and challenging cyber worlds. Four different weapons are available to him at the press of a button - multiway Vulcan-gun, wide laser-beams, spread homing-lasers and a short-range lightning gun. Each weapon can be powered-up a grand total of three times by collecting &amp;quot;P&amp;quot; pods that appear on the screen whereas &amp;quot;S&amp;quot; pods increase the overall speed of the ship. Other special items are available throughout the game such as smart-bombs and protective shields.</resource>

However, following a breakthrough discovery, Steiner mysteriously disappears. His daughter Chris travels to Central America in search of her father, and steps into an intimidating world of monsters and conspiracies.

Hih? Densetsu: Chris no B?ken is a platformer. Chris is armed with a dagger and cannot use any other weapons or gadgets to protect herself. However, the dagger can be upgraded by collecting colored orbs dropped by enemies. Depending on their combination, the dagger can be used as a long-ranged weapon, firing projectiles or acting as a boomerang. The protagonist's health is measured with hearts; a stage must be restarted if Chris runs out of all five of them. Enemies would sometimes leave hearts and coins behind; the latter add an extra life to Chris if she collects a sufficient amount. 

A boss enemy awaits at the end of every second stage. Other features include moving and disappearing platforms, deadly traps such as spikes, mine cart-riding, and a strict time limit for each stage. The story is advanced through anime-style cutscenes between stages.</resource>

These creatures simply walk blindly through the world in the hope of reaching safety at the end of the level - unfortunately these levels include steep drops, gaps in the ground, barriers and rivers amongst other hazards.

You are in control not of any individual Lemming, but of a cross-hair, which can be moved over any of the Lemmings. Along the bottom are a selection of functions which can be assigned to a Lemming, including climbing, floating and bashing. You must click to select the appropriate function, then click on the Lemming to activate it. Each level has a different range of skills on offer, a different amount of Lemmings, and a different percentage target in order to progress.</resource>

On the continent of Audores, princesses of various countries and other noble ladies compete in the game of mahjong, trying to gain possession of the sacred titular sword. The player takes control of the young warrior Rutia, who must defeat five opponents on her way to glory.

Mahjong matches follow the typical one-on-one scheme, but the results are presented as battles, with animated attacks and hit points depleted. Money gained from winning mahjong games is spent in the shops on items that can be later used before a mahjong match for various bonuses. 

Opponents also undress when losing a mahjong game. The computer version has scenes with explicit nudity as well as torture at those points. The PC Engine (TurboGrafx) CD version only displays scantily clad women, removing nudity and torture scenes.</resource>

    <resource id="dbdced41fc2d54b03c0594d80493e43a56c3bd8a" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">The plot of Metamor Jupiter is simple: a biological mutation causes an alien race to spread all over the galaxy. Armed with advanced technology, the aliens sent their machines and robots to face humanity in a cosmic battle. To counter that, the humans draw from the newly discovered crystal energy to deploy a unit of powerful fighter crafts, which can change their shapes in an instant, adapting to every situation.

The player controls one of such crafts, and has to fly and shoot his way through side-scrolling levels populated by regular enemies, bosses, and various types of hazards. Other fighters will accompany the player-controlled machine from time to time, but they usually don't survive the robotic onslaught, and the player character is left to fend for himself. 

As the premise implies, the defining feature of the game is the fighter craft's ability to change shapes. The three main variations have two weapons each, which are suited for different situations. For example, one of the forms has vertical fire, but lacks powerful explosives; another can drop bombs, but has a slow forward beam attack, etc. Each of the forms can gather power-ups, which will strengthen the conventional weapons.

Unlike most shooters of this kind, there are no &amp;quot;lives&amp;quot;; instead, the player-controlled  plane has a set amount of hit points, parts of which are depleted when it gets hit. Hit points can be restored by catching power-ups scattered across the levels.</resource>

A group of four treasure hunters come across an announcement promising a reward of one million credits to whoever would recover a mysterious purple stone with the engraving of the Empire's crest on it. The four find the artifact relatively quickly, but it is stolen from them by another group with an agenda of their own. Now the heroes must bring the stone back while dealing with the dangerous foes on their way.

Mystic Formula is a top-down shooter. The player navigates the protagonist through hostile environments, shooting at regular enemies and bosses, and avoiding their attacks. The player can choose to control any of the four treasure hunters: a balanced lead character armed with a laser pistol; an elf who shoots fireballs from her staff; an agile female thief; and a sturdy, slow, yet powerful robot. All the characters use ranged attacks that can be upgraded with power-ups. In addition, another type of a power-up brings forth one of the characters from the group to aid the player in combat, controlled by the AI. Two-player mode is available as well.</resource>

The goal is get all of the soldiers to the opposite side of the screen or to kill all of the enemies. Each soldier in the army has a unique specialization, from among 20 types. Each soldier can attack in two different ways, using either a normal weapon or a special weapon. The strategy comes from deciding which soldier would do best in which situation. Some weapons are better at dealing with certain enemies and obstacles than other weapons.

Players start with only three soldiers but can encounter other soldiers that can be rescued, by touching them. If the new soldier survives long enough to reach the exit, they can be added to the soldier inventory. The number of possible soldier in a player's army is over 30 soldiers. There are 50 stages total, divided into rounds of 10. At the end of each round, players encounter an enemy boss.</resource>

It is a story about heroes who have descended into hell, defeated the Demon King, and saved the seven worlds from grave peril. This story is now taught in all the schools for young adventurers, who wish to become heroes and defeat the minions of hell once and for all. Those who have already graduated are called &amp;quot;travelers&amp;quot;; four of them are the heroes of the game - two young men and two young women. Led by the reckless swordsman Ufuru, the travelers begin to roam the land in search of adventure...

The game is a rather traditional Japanese RPG. The player always controls the party of four heroes; the two men use sword techniques, one of the girls specializes in offensive magic, while the other one is a healer. The player navigates the party over the &amp;quot;world map&amp;quot;, visiting towns and descending into dungeons. Randomly appearing enemies are fought in turn-based style. Leveling up is automatic, like in most games of the kind. There is a day/night cycle in the game.</resource>

Like most games in the genre, there are three color-coded weapons: red (scatter), green (homing) and blue (lasers). Each weapon has three levels of power, and to obtain those, similar upgrades must be collected sequentially. However, what makes the game unique is the ability to use a traction beam to trap an enemy and then throw him against his peers, destroying them.

The game (more precisely, the European PAL version of it) is known for being the origin of the grammatically incorrect phrase in the English translation, All your base are belong to us, which has since become an internet phenomenon. </resource>

The player controls young women clad in robotic suits, who compete against similarly equipped female opponents in the game of mahjong. There is only one mode in the game, and the player has no ability of selecting the controllable character or the antagonist. Each round won by the player depletes a portion of the opponent's &amp;quot;health&amp;quot;, which results in gradual undressing culminating in full nudity.</resource>

When the player has gathered a sufficient amount of money he is allowed to watch the girl's undressing stage.</resource>

That pretty much sums up the plot of Insanity, the first PC Engine game from homebrew developers Aetherbyte Studios. Insanity is essentially a clone of the classic arcade game Berzerk and retains the straightforward gameplay of the original. You run around the flip-screen play area (whose map layout is randomly generated from a selection of master templates) shooting the robots that are out to get you. The robots are pretty dumb to begin with and often blow themselves up by wandering into the electrified walls, but as you progress they get a little faster and a lot more aggressive, making anticipation and dodging of lasers key skills. The action is accompanied by a selection of retro styled music tracks, giving you the option of CD music or chip generated versions of the same tunes.</resource>

    <resource id="a31747eb0c538b2a32f3a7ed91de002e8081bda2" type="description" source="screenscraper" timestamp="0">Long time ago, the races of humans and fairy creatures co-existed peacefully. But the power of magic corrupted some of them. The magic users were divided into those who supported the Light and those who turned to Darkness. The balance was broken, and peace between humans and fairy creatures were no longer possible. One day, a wandering samurai is caught in a storm on a sea; washed ashore, he loses his memory. Teaming up with two other warriors, the hero meets a benevolent sorceress named Garland, who sends them on a quest to rid the land of fairy creatures who got rampant, and help her in her battle against the evil sorceress whose plan is to destroy peace forever.

Like other  Games Express titles, Hi-Leg Fantasy is an erotically-themed parody on a well-known game franchise - in this case, obviously the  Final Fantasy series, most particularly its  fifth installment. Combat, character growth, even menu design strongly remind of classic Final Fantasy games; as in those, the battles utilize the ATB (active time battle) system. The &amp;quot;job&amp;quot; system from Final Fantasy V is implemented here as well.

The adult element is present in the battles. Enemies are young and sexy girls, mostly fairy creatures of various kinds. As they sustain damage in battles, they begin to lose their clothes, until they become naked upon defeat.</resource>

The seduction process is almost completely automated; all the player has to do is to choose the command icons (&amp;quot;Look&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Talk&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Touch&amp;quot;, etc.) repeatedly until the next scene is triggered. There are no dead ends, no &amp;quot;Game Over&amp;quot;, and no challenge and/or branching events whatsoever in the game.</resource>

The interactive scenario of the game is called Toraware Usagi; its theme is rape as well. The nameless protagonist finds a girl in a Japanese high-school uniform, tied and blind-folded. The entire scenario consists of a long scene, during which the &amp;quot;hero&amp;quot; proceeds to rape the girl.

The interactivity level is even lower here than it was in its predecessors. Not only there are absolutely no variants in command selection; the commands themselves must be selected in a specific order every time to trigger the next scene (eye icon, hand icon, mouth icon); all the icons are &amp;quot;blocked&amp;quot; before the previous one is selected.</resource>

Unlike the previous game, the entire procedure here is consensual.

The gameplay abandons the Japanese adventure format with its verb icons, becoming instead a very simple, very short visual novel with just a few choices the player can make between non-interactive text and pictures. Some of these choices lead to the Game Over screen.</resource>
