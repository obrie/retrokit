## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## I have a question!

> If you want to ask a question, we assume that you have read the available [documentation](manual/).

Before you ask a question, it's best to search for existing issues that might help you.
In case you've found a suitable issue and still need clarification, you can write your question
in that issue.

If you still feel the need to ask a question and need clarification, it's recommended to:

- Open an issue.
- Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into
- Provide project and hardware versions (RetroPie, Raspberry Pi 4b, etc), depending on what seems relevant

## I want to contribute!

### Reporting Bugs

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you down for more information.
Investigate carefully, collect information and describe the issue in detail. Some details
that can help get your bug fixed as soon as possible include:

- Make sure that you are using the latest version
- Collect information about the bug, such as stack trace, os version, etc.
- Any commands that you ran
- Can you reliably reproduce the issue? And can you also reproduce it with older versions?

### Suggesting Enhancements

Have an idea for an enhancement?  Great!  Before you submit a suggestion:

- Make sure that you are using the latest version
- Read the docs carefully and to see if it's already covered
- Search the issues to see if the enhancement has already been suggested

When submitting a suggestion:

- Use a **clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion
- Provide a **description of the enhancement** in as many details as possible
- **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why.
- **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most users. You may also want to point out the other projects that solved it better and which could serve as inspiration.
