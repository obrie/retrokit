# retrokit

retrokit provides powerful automation and UX improvements for retro-gaming systems
built with RetroPie / Raspberry Pi 4.

In addition to being a configuration management tool, retrokit consists of several
sub-projects, including:

* üéÆ [autoport](manual/autoport.md) - Advanced automatic joystick (controller/mouse) selection for libretro and standalone emulators
* üéÆ [devicekit](manual/devicekit.md) - Python library for building applications based on RetroArch autoconfig controls
* üìñ [manualkit](manual/manualkit.md) - Application for displaying game manuals from EmulationStation or during gameplay
* üè∑Ô∏è [metakit](manual/metakit.md) - Python tool for managing system metadata sourced from many different websites, forums, etc.
* üîå [powerkit](manual/powerkit.md) - Advanced safe system/emulator shutdown tool controlled through hardware and joysticks
* üóÉÔ∏è [romkit](manual/romkit.md) - Tool for listing, filtering, organizing, converting, and installing games from romsets
* üî´ [sindenkit](manual/sindenkit.md) - Plug 'n play functionality and quality-of-life improvements for Sinden Lightguns
* üìö [manuals archive](https://archive.org/details/retrokit-manuals) - A collection of ~20,000 manuals across 40+ systems, catalogued by hand

All of this means you can set up your system from scratch to feature-complete
with less than a few hours worth of work.  Systems built with retrokit are:

* **Easy to use**: No need to worry about getting phone calls from your friends
  about how to use the system
* **Easy to recreate**: Every aspect is automated and codified
* **Easy to extend**: Start with your base image and layer on new functionality

retrokit is built primarily for RetroPie / Raspberry Pi 4.  You must customize it
to your own needs.

**NOTE** This repository does not contain ROMs or URLs to websites that provide
ROMs.  To utilize any download functionality in retrokit, you must provide the
configurations yourself.  Please familiarize yourself with the law in your country
before attempting to download ROMs.

## Why does this exist?

In 2021, I set out to build a retro gaming system for my brother's 40th birthday.
I wanted to build the best experience I could to transport us back to our childhood.
As I started to create the system, I quickly realized how complicated it could get.
To help iterate on the setup more quickly, I wanted to build the system in such a way
that I could re-create the exact same setup steps each time.

retrokit represents the work I did to build a configuration management system for
all of my personal builds.

## Demo

For a demo of what the end result looks like, see here.

## How to use

You can use retrokit just for its sub-projects (e.g. manualkit / romkit) or you
can use it for software automation / configuration management as well.

You will need to provide a `.env` file with the appropriate details filled out.
You can use [.env.template](.env.template) as a starting point. In order to not
encourage improper use of the ROM downloader (via romkit), you must provide the
source rom set URLs yourself.

Go through the settings and setup modules and become familiar with what this does.
If you have a proper `.env` file, you can get a fully working system with very
little effort.  However, understand that this is opinionated software and you
may very well want to add your own customizations.

You can have complete control over what parts of retrokit get used via [profiles](manual/profiles.md).
I strongly recommend using profiles to customize your configuration.  That being
said, feel free to fork this repo and use your fork to update and track
all of your personal preferences.

## Quickstart

### Creating a base image

1. Override settings in `profiles/mykit/` to match your personal preferences and hardware requirements
1. Create a `.env` file based on [env.template](.env.template) to provide the required configuration settings
1. Flash new image (Note this will also expand the main partition and copy retrokit
   onto the sd card):
   ```
   bin/sd.sh create /path/to/device # e.g. /dev/mmcblk0
   ```
1. Insert sd card into Pi

### Install via base image

1. Start up Pi
1. Quit EmulationStation (F4)
1. Update Raspbian
   ```
   retrokit/bin/update.sh system
   ```
1. Reboot
   ```
   sudo reboot
   ```
1. Update RetroPie-Setup and its packages
   ```
   retrokit/bin/update.sh retropie
   ```
1. Run retrokit
   ```
   retrokit/bin/setup.sh install
   ```
1. Reboot
   ```
   sudo reboot
   ```
1. Have fun!

To access via VNC:

* Open in VNC client: `<ip address of rpi>:5900`

Alternatively, you can run the retrokit setup script via the RetroPie
EmulationStation menu.

### Install via git

1. Clone repo
   ```
   cd $HOME
   git clone https://github.com/obrie/retrokit
   ```
1. Follow steps from base image install

### Install via scriptmodule

1. Download scriptmodule
   ```
   curl https://github.com/obrie/retrokit/raw/main/bin/scriptmodules/supplementary/retrokit.sh --create-dirs -o $HOME/RetroPie-Setup/ext/retrokit/supplementary/retrokit.sh
   curl https://github.com/obrie/retrokit/raw/main/bin/scriptmodules/supplementary/retrokit/icon.png --create-dirs -o $HOME/RetroPie-Setup/ext/retrokit/supplementary/retrokit/icon.png
   ```
2. Install script module via UI or:
   ```
   sudo /home/pi/RetroPie-Setup/retropie_packages.sh retrokit _source_
   ```
3. Follow steps from base image install

## My favorites

I'd be hard-pressed to list every single feature that is built into retrokit as
this project represents the culmination of years of work.  That being said, I at
least want to call out my favorite features in retrokit:

* **Manuals**.
  Where would I be if I couldn't bring up manuals for the games I'm playing?  With
  the [retrokit-manuals](https://archive.org/details/retrokit-manuals) project, I
  have access to thousands of manuals that I've personally validated and processed.
  It makes life so much easier.

* **System / Game references**.
  With so many systems, it's impossible to keep track of what each button does for
  each system.  The [reference sheets](manual/controls.md) are incredibly useful
  for reminding you how to actually use a system.

* **Emulator Safe Shutdown**.
  When mixing libretro and standalone emulators, you end up in a situation where
  exiting an emulator becomes an exercise in remembering exactly how the specific
  emulator you're using works (and we sometimes use multiple emulators for a single
  system!).  With [powerkit](manual/powerkit.md), I can forget about that altogether
  and just focus on playing games.  Phew!

* **Automatic Port Selection**.
  Between joysticks, trackballs, lightguns, and arcade sticks, I have a lot of
  different controllers I use for different games.  Making the input selection
  deterministic based on the game being loaded is a huge pain to deal with manually.
  Fortunately, [autoport](manual/autoport.md) makes that incredibly easy.  I never
  have to worry that the wrong controller is chosen by an emulator.

* **Configuration Management**.
  Yes, we can create backups of our systems.  But, do you know every single step
  you took to get your system to the state it's in from the base RetroPie install?
  Programmatically managing my system makes 2 things incredible easy: (a) if I need
  to change a configuration, I can simply re-run retrokit and everything will be
  udpated based on my new configuration and (b) I can sleep soundly knowing that if
  something catastrophic happened, I can always re-run retrokit from scratch and
  get the exact same system I had originally.

* **Input autoconfig**.
  With so many different systems and emulators installed, automatic input configuration
  is even more important.  With autoconfigs for every emulator, I can add new
  controllers to my system and never have to worry about going into a standalone
  emulator's configuration to get it working.

Honestly, there's a *ton* more functionality in retrokit that I love, but the
above are my favorites.  Honorable mentions:

* Automatic emulator selection for best performance
* Unified controller layouts across mame emulators
* Automatic installation of launch images, overlays, cheats, and mess artwork
* Advanced setup of MAME (plugins, hiscores, history, game info, etc.)
* Automatic management of collections and favorites

## Final words

retrokit has the potential to be incredibly powerful for managing your system.
Be patient, read the documentation, learn the system, but most importantly:
have fun :)

This has been a passion project of mine for years.  It's my hope that, even if
you don't use this project, perhaps there is something valuable you can take from it.
