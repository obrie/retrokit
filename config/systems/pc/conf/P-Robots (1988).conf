echo This game is more of a battle between pre-programmed
echo robots in Pascal.  Users can either stage fights between
echo preexisting robots or program their own.  Unfortunately
echo the syntax requires the names of the competing robots
echo to be declared at launch.  I have disabled the auto-exit
echo feature of dosbox to allow the user to launch their own
echo robot attacks.  To exitdosbox you can hit Ctrl-F9, or
echo type exit.
