echo When you first start you will find yourself in a small area with 5 statues.
echo This is actually part of the copy protection. You must take the number at the
echo bottom of the screen, then use them with the included code sheet to determine
echo how many times to strike each statue.
echo.
echo For example. If the number is 104-05-5, you would look up page 104, Row 5,
echo Column 5 This would give you the number 14222. So you would strike the left
echo most statue 1 time, the next statue 4 times, and the other three 2 times.
echo.
echo Unfortunately the code sheet provided only has 6 pages transcribed of 20, so
echo you may have to restart a few times until you get one that is included. You
echo can do this by simply pressing ESC to drop back to the main menu and then
echo restarting.
