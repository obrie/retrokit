Congratulations! You are now the proud owner of a one-of-a-kind retro gaming system.
What started as a fun project evolved into an obsession to build the best experience
I could to transport my brothers and me back to our childhood.
</p>

<p>
This project required  development and testing to build a system
that brings together all the elements of retro gaming to your fingertips:
extensive libraries, manuals, per-game configurations, collections,
system guides, videos, overlays / splash screens, cheats, and so much more that
I could never possibly cover it all here.
</p>

<p>
Additionally, 15,000+ game manuals have been catalogued by hand, meticulously
gathered from the highest quality sources and made available directly within
the game for every system.  Not only can you play the games you loved, but
remember how to play them too!
</p>

<p>
This system has been built with love and passion for well over a year with
countless late nights and long weekends.  I hope this brings back memories
you can share with your friends and family.
</p>

<p>
Please enjoy.
